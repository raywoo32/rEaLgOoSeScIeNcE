As many goose populations across the northern Hemisphere continue to rise, the role of hunters to manage these populations is increasingly being considered. We studied recreational goose hunters in Denmark to assess their behavioural and motivational characteristics, willingness to alter their hunting effort, as well as their ability to act as stewards of a rapidly increasing goose population. We identified several behavioural characteristics that typify effective goose hunting practices. We suggest a degree of specialization is necessary to increase goose harvests, as well as mitigating animal welfare issues (e.g. wounding). However, the majority of Danish goose hunters can be considered to be casual participants in this form of hunting. This poses a challenge for wildlife managers wishing to engage recreational hunters to manage highly dynamic wildlife populations, such as geese. If recreational hunters are to be used as a management tool, wildlife managers and hunting organizations will need to consider how best to facilitate skill development, hunting practices and socially legitimate hunting ethics to foster the stewardship role of hunting. We conclude that it is incumbent on wildlife managers to recognize and deal with both internal factors (e.g. skill development) and external influences (e.g. animal welfare concerns). In doing so, potential tensions in the multi-functionality of hunting can be alleviated, maintain hunting as a legitimate and accepted recreational past-time and management tool.

The energy and nutrient content of most agricultural crops are as good as or superior to natural foods for wild geese and they tend to be available in agricultural landscapes in far greater abundance. Artificial grasslands (fertilised native swards and intensively managed reseeds) offer far superior quality forage and higher intake rates than seminatural or natural grasslands. The availability of such abundant artificial food explains the abandonment of traditional habitats for farmland by geese over the last 50-100 years and favours no reduction in current levels of exploitation of agriculture. Continental scale spatial and temporal shifts among geese undergoing spring fattening confirm their flexibility to respond rapidly to broadscale changes in agriculture. These dramatic changes support the hypothesis that use of agricultural landscapes has contributed to elevated reproductive success and that European and North American farmland currently provides unrestricted winter carrying capacity for goose populations formerly limited by wetlands habitats prior to the agrarian revolution of the last century.

Studies on distribution dynamics of waterbirds and the relation with hydrological changes are essential components of ecological researches. East Dongting Lake is a Ramsar site and especially important wintering ground for herbivorous geese along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. In this paper, based on annual (2008/09-2016/17) waterbird census data, we investigated the spatial-temporal distributions of three herbivorous goose species (Lesser White-fronted Goose Anser erythropus, Bean Goose Anser fabalis, and Greater White-fronted Goose Anser albifrons) within East Dongting Lake, and analyzed their distribution dynamics (denoted by percentage similarity index, PSI) relative to variations in hydrological regime. The results demonstrated that the distribution of the globally vulnerable Lesser White-fronted Geese changed obviously between years, whereas that of Bean Geese was more stable. Greater White-fronted Geese suffered drastic distribution variation during the study period. The PSI of Lesser White-fronted Geese was negatively correlated with between-year difference in water recession time and mean water level in October, whereas no obvious trend was found in Bean Geese. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was applied to detect changes in food resources of the geese, and significant correlations were also found between NDVI and hydrological factors. It was inferred that the variations in hydrological regime affected the annual distribution dynamics of Lesser White-fronted Geese by changing food conditions; whereas the effect on Bean Geese were not reflected in this study. Species traits may explain the differences in distribution dynamics among the three goose species. It was speculated that Lesser White-fronted Geese might be more sensitive to habitat change, whereas Bean Geese were more resilient. We suggested that regulating hydrological regime was crucial in management works. Our study could offer scientific information for species conservation in the context of habitat changes in East Dongting Lake wetland and provide potential insights into habitat management in this area.

High-altitude bar-headed geese (Anser indicus) and Andean geese (Chloephaga melanoptera) have been shown to preferentially increase tidal volume over breathing frequency when increasing ventilation during exposure to hypoxia. Increasing tidal volume is a more effective breathing strategy but is also thought to be more mechanically and metabolically expensive. We asked whether there might be differences in the mechanics or morphology of the respiratory systems of high-altitude transient bar-headed geese and high-altitude resident Andean geese that could minimize the cost of breathing more deeply. We compared these two species with a low-altitude migratory species, the barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis). We ventilated anesthetized birds to measure mechanical properties of the respiratory system and used CT scans to quantify respiratory morphology. We found that the respiratory system of Andean geese was disproportionately larger than that of the other two species, allowing use of a deeper breathing strategy for the same energetic cost. The relative size of the respiratory system, especially the caudal air sacs, of bar-headed geese was also larger than that of barnacle geese. However, when normalized to respiratory system size, the mechanical cost of breathing did not differ significantly among these three species, indicating that deeper breathing is enabled by morphological but not mechanical differences between species. The metabolic cost of breathing was estimated to be <1% of basal metabolic rate at rest in normoxia. Because of differences in the magnitude of the ventilatory response, the cost of breathing was estimated to increase 7- to 10-fold in bar-headed and barnacle geese in severe hypoxia, but less than 1-fold in Andean geese exposed to the same low atmospheric PO2.

In several countries in northwestern Europe, the number of resident greylag geese (Anser anser) has increased by up to 20% a year over the last few decades. The increasing numbers of geese are causing problems in tourism and agriculture. The number of resident greylag geese visiting the Altmuehlsee lake, a recreational area in the south of Germany, has also increased, especially in June and July. However, the geese leave the lake again at the beginning of August. 30 adult greylag geese were banded with telemetry transmitters during molting at the Altmuehlsee lake to determine when the geese leave the lake in August and what structures they need in their winter habitat. The distances the greylag geese flew from their resting sites to foraging sites were calculated, as well as the size of their home ranges and the proportions of each habitat type in the home range. It was found that the greylag geese used small home ranges while rearing their young, and fed close to the water. After molting, the size of their home ranges increased. They fed on fields and meadows around the lake. In the winter habitat, the geese also had a small home range, and they preferred eating grain and corn and the availability of an open body of water. In addition, one group of geese remained in the city of Munich during the winter, benefiting from supplementary food from people. This information helps us to understand the different requirements of resident greylag geese. It can be used to inform management decisions aimed at preventing agricultural damage. Special goose areas can for example be designated for the different periods in a goose's life cycle.

In this study, we characterized for the first time the gut microbiota of Greylag geese (Anser anser) using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing technology. The results showed that the phyla Firmicutes (78.55%), Fusobacteria (9.38%), Proteobacteria (7.55%), Bacteroidetes (1.82%), Cyanobacteria (1.44%), and Actinobacteria (0.61%) dominated the gut microbial communities in the Greylag geese. Then, the variations of gut microbial community structures and functions among the three geese species, Greylag geese, Bar-headed geese (Anser indicus), and Swan geese (Anser cygnoides), were explored. The greatest gut microbial diversity was found in Bar-headed geese group, while other two groups had the least. The dominant bacterial phyla across all samples were Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, but several characteristic bacterial phyla and genera associated with each group were also detected. At all taxonomic levels, the microbial community structure of Swan geese was different from those of Greylag geese and Bar-headed geese, whereas the latter two groups were less different. Functional KEGG categories and pathways associated with carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, and amino acid metabolism were differentially expressed among different geese species. Taken together, this study could provide valuable information to the vast, and yet little explored, research field of wild birds gut microbiome.

Climate warming challenges animals to advance their timing of reproduction [1], but many animals appear to be unable to advance at the same rate as their food species [2, 3]. As a result, mismatches can arise between the moment of largest food requirements for their offspring and peak food availability [4-6], with important fitness consequences [7]. For long-distance migrants, adjustment of phenology to climate warming may be hampered by their inability to predict the optimal timing of arrival at the breeding grounds from their wintering grounds [8]. Arrival can be advanced if birds accelerate migration by reducing time on stopover sites [9, 10], but a recent study suggests that most long-distance migrants are on too tight a schedule to do so [11]. This may be different for capital-breeding migrants, which use stopovers not only to fuel migration but also to acquire body stores needed for reproduction [12-14]. By combining multiple years of tracking and reproduction data, we show that a long-distance migratory bird (the barnacle goose, Branta leucopsis) accelerates its 3,000 km spring migration to advance arrival on its rapidly warming Arctic breeding grounds. As egg laying has advanced much less than arrival, they still encounter a phenological mismatch that reduces offspring survival. A shift toward using more local resources for reproduction suggests that geese first need to refuel body stores at the breeding grounds after accelerated migration. Although flexibility in body store use allows migrants to accelerate migration, this cannot solve the time constraint they are facing under climate warming.

The Chinese goose originated from the swan goose (Anser cygnoides) and the European goose originated from the greylag goose (Anser anser). The Chinese and European geese have the potential to crossbreed. Whether interspecific differences in mating behaviors affect successful hybridization is unknown. In this study, 10-month-old Carlos geese (n = 120; Anser anser) and Sichuan geese (Anser cygnoides) were selected, and 12 multi-male parent families (3♂+12♀) were established. The courtship and mating behaviors of pure and cross-bred combinations of the Carlos and Sichuan geese were recorded using video cameras. Initiative courtship by males was the main type of courtship. Fixed mating, mating interference, and uncooperative mating were common in the flocks. The frequencies of some courtship and mating behaviors were less in the cross-bred groups (Carlos ganders × Sichuan geese, Sichuan ganders × Carlos geese) compared with the Sichuan pure-bred groups (P < 0.05). The Carlos male geese had some unique mating behaviors (i.e., one-to-one mating, formation of distinct hierarchies, and competition interference). The fertility rate had a significant correlation with the frequency of successful mating (rp = 0.992, P < 0.05), rather than with the courtship behavior. These results indicate there were lesser frequencies of courtship and successful matings in the cross-breeding than purebreeding groups. Furthermore, the fertility rate depended largely on the successful mating behavior and was independent of the courtship behavior.

Low pathogenic avian influenza virus can mutate to a highly pathogenic strain that causes severe clinical signs in birds and humans. Migratory waterfowl, especially ducks, are considered the main hosts of low pathogenic avian influenza virus, but the role of geese in dispersing the virus over long-distances is still unclear. We collected throat and cloaca samples from three goose species, Bean goose (Anser fabalis), Barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis) and Greater white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons), from their breeding grounds, spring stopover sites, and wintering grounds. We tested if the geese were infected with low pathogenic avian influenza virus outside of their wintering grounds, and analysed the spatial and temporal patterns of infection prevalence on their wintering grounds. Our results show that geese were not infected before their arrival on wintering grounds. Barnacle geese and Greater white-fronted geese had low prevalence of infection just after their arrival on wintering grounds in the Netherlands, but the prevalence increased in successive months, and peaked after December. This suggests that migratory geese are exposed to the virus after their arrival on wintering grounds, indicating that migratory geese might not disperse low pathogenic avian influenza virus during autumn migration.

This study was designed to investigate the effects of fermented feed diets on the growth performance and cecal microbial community in geese, and to examine associations between the gut microbiota and growth performance. A total of 720 healthy, 1-day-old male SanHua geese were used for the 55-D experiment. Geese were randomly divided into 4 groups, each with 6 replicates of 30 geese. Groups were fed a basal diet supplemented with 0.0, 2.5, 5.0, or 7.5% fermented feed. The results showed that 7.5% fermented feed had an increasing trend in the body weight and average daily gain of the geese; however, there was no significant response to increasing dietary fermented feed level with regards to ADFI and FCR. In addition, compared with the control group, there was a higher abundance of bacteria in the phylum Bacteroidetes in the cecal samples of geese in the 7.5% fermented feed group (53.18% vs. 41.77%, P < 0.05), whereas the abundance of Firmicutes was lower in the 7.5% fermented feed group (36.30% vs. 44.13%, P > 0.05). At the genus level, the abundance of Bacteroides was increased by adding fermented feed to geese diets, whereas the abundances of Desulfovibrio, Phascolarctobacterium, Lachnospiraceae_uncultured, Ruminiclostridium, and Oscillospira were decreased. These results indicate that fermented feeds have an important effect on the cecal microflora composition of geese, and may affect host growth, nutritional status, and intestinal health.

Mathematical models of the egg-laying curves for Yangzhou geese exposed to both natural and artificial photoperiods were established to optimise the parameters for maximising geese reproductive performance and for the development of precision feeding methods. With the natural photoperiod, egg-laying starts in autumn when daily photoperiod decreases, but accelerates after the winter solstice, and reaches the peak in spring when photoperiod increases. An accumulating model was constructed based on the hypothesis that the egg-laying capacity of geese was determined by two components of the photoperiod: photo-stimulation and photo-inhibition. In addition, a second segmented model was constructed based on the hypothesis that the photo-stimulation only occurred with lengthening photoperiods after the winter solstice, and the lesser laying rate in autumn could be attributed to the non-photo-dependent animal-husbandry technologies. This model consists of a logistic model before the winter solstice, and an accumulating model after this solstice. The use of the logistic and accumulating resulted in more precise predictions that occurred with use of Model 1 with a greater R2 and lesser RMSE, AIC and BIC. Likewise, the egg-laying curves when there was consideration of artificial photoperiods could also be constructed with consideration of stimulatory and inhibitory photoperiodic effects. The model consists of an initial logistic and subsequently a quadratic polynomial model. With use of this model, there is consideration of changes in egg-laying patterns when there is a fixed photoperiod, with the model parameters reflecting the effects by photoperiod control-programs and age of the geese. In conclusion, new mathematical models have been developed to best fit egg-laying curves when there are both natural and artificial photoperiods. These models can contribute to development of precision-feeding technologies for breeding geese in future.

The macronutrients that Arctic herbivores invest in their offspring are derived from endogenous reserves of fat and protein (capital) that females build prior to the period of investment or from foods they consume concurrently with investment (income). The relative contribution from each source can be influenced by temporal and environmental constraints on a female's ability to forage on Arctic breeding areas. Warming temperatures and advancing Arctic phenology may alter those constraints. From 2011 to 2014, we examined relationships among spring temperature, timing of migration and reproduction, and the sources of nutrients females deposited in eggs for three sympatric species of geese that nested in northern Alaska. Compared to lesser snow geese (Anser caerulescens caerulescens) and greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons frontalis), black brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) were more likely to initiate follicle development during migration, resulting in fewer days between their arrival in the Arctic and the onset of incubation and requiring a relatively greater capital investment in eggs. Delaying follicle development until after their arrival in the Arctic provided snow geese and white-fronted geese an opportunity to forage near their nesting area and to deposit exogenous nutrients in eggs. With warmer spring temperatures, brant invested more capital in eggs, but snow geese invested less capital. Brant likely used capital to meet costs associated with earlier onset of follicle development when phenology was advanced, whereas snow geese used capital to compensate for poor foraging conditions during colder Arctic springs. Global warming is likely to reduce the quality of lower latitude marine habitats where brant acquire endogenous reserves and advancing Arctic phenology may increase their reliance on those reserves during reproduction. Near-term warming in northern Alaska may improve foraging conditions and favor the reproductive strategies of some herbivores such as snow geese and white-fronted geese that mainly invest Arctic nutrients in their offspring.

While wild goose populations wintering in North America and Europe are mostly flourishing by exploiting farmland, those in China (which seem confined to natural wetlands) are generally declining. Telemetry devices were attached to 67 wintering wild geese of five different species at three important wetlands in the Yangtze River Floodplain (YRF), China to determine habitat use. 50 individuals of three declining species were almost entirely diurnally confined to natural wetlands; 17 individuals from two species showing stable trends used wetlands 83% and 90% of the time, otherwise resorting to farmland. These results confirm earlier studies linking declines among Chinese wintering geese to natural habitat loss and degradation affecting food supply. These results also contribute to explaining the poor conservation status of Chinese wintering geese compared to the same and other goose species wintering in adjacent Korea and Japan, western Europe and North America, which feed almost entirely on agricultural land, liberating them from winter population limitation.

1. This study investigates the slaughter, carcass and meat quality traits of artificially and naturally hatched geese in intensive and free-range production systems. 2. The study was conducted with 114 naturally hatched and 102 artificially hatched geese. From each replicate of the intensive and free-range systems, one female and one male goose were slaughtered at the ages of 14, 16 and 18 weeks (a total of 32 geese per slaughter week). 3. Artificially hatched geese had higher slaughter weights (5280 vs. 4404 g), carcass weights (3520 vs. 2863), dressing percentages (66.6-65.2% vs. 65.0-63.6%) and carcass part, feather and edible inner organ weights. The ratio of both edible inner organs and abdominal fat was higher in naturally hatched geese. Breast meat L*, a* and pH values and thigh meat dry matter values were higher in artificially hatched geese, whereas thigh meat b* and pH values were higher in naturally hatched geese. 4. Intensively reared geese had higher slaughter weights (4900 vs. 4783 g), carcass weights (3253 vs. 3130 g) and abdominal fat weights (280 vs. 250 g), as well as higher dressing percentages (66.3-64.9% vs. 65.3-63.9%). Breast meat b* and thigh meat L* values were higher in the intensive system, while breast and thigh pH values, dripping loss and cooking loss were higher in the free-range system. Water-holding capacity was higher in the intensive system. 5. In conclusion, artificially hatched, intensively reared geese had the highest slaughter weights; however, both artificially and naturally hatched geese raised in a free-range system reached acceptable slaughter weights and can thus be recommended for use with this type of production system.

Increasing abundance of geese in North America and Europe constitutes a major conservation success, but has caused increasing conflicts with economic, health and safety interests, as well as ecosystem impacts. Potential conflict resolution through a single, 'one size fits all' policy is hindered by differences in species' ecology, behaviour, abundance and population status, and in contrasting political and socio-economic environments across the flyways. Effective goose management requires coordinated application of a suite of tools from the local level to strategic flyway management actions. The European Goose Management Platform, established under the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds, aims to harmonise and prioritise management, monitoring and conservation efforts, sharing best practice internationally by facilitating agreed policies, coordinating flyway efforts, and sharing and exchanging experiences and information. This depends crucially upon adequate government financing, the collection of necessary monitoring data (e.g., on distribution, abundance, hunting bags, demography, ecosystem and agricultural damage), the collation and effective use of such data and information, as well as the evaluation of outcomes of existing management measures.

To explore the key regulatory genes and their translated products involved in Huoyan goose egg laying, we first applied the iTRAQ technology integrated with LC-MS/MS analysis to identify differentially abundant proteins in the ovarian tissue of Huoyan geese between the pre-laying and laying periods. Then, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses of the proteins were conducted. As observed, 403 proteins, which included 255 up-regulated and 148 down-regulated proteins, were identified. Some differentially abundant proteins, such as apolipoprotein B (apoB), retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4), vitellogenin-2 (VTG-2), apolipoprotein II (apoVLDL-II), and fatty-acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), were found to be involved in lipid transportation and metabolic process, follicle development and final egg production, ovarian steroidogenesis, and steroid hormone biosynthesis. Subsequently, the modification of the abundance of 3 proteins, adiponectin, FABP4, and RBP4, was verified using Western blotting. Our findings might provide comprehensive protein expression information that can facilitate the understanding of the reproductive biology and improve the egg-laying performance of Huoyan geese.

We investigated the effects of dietary fiber on growth performance, slaughter performance, serum biochemical parameters, and nutrient utilization in geese. A total of 468 one-day-old healthy male Yangzhou goslings with similar body weight were randomly divided into 3 groups with 6 replicates per group and 26 geese per replicate. The geese were then raised for 70 days on diets with a dietary fiber level of 2.5% (Group I), 6.1% (Group III), or 4.3% for d one to 28 and 6.1% for d 29 to 70 (Group II). The geese in Groups II and III had higher body weight, higher average daily gain, and lower ratio of feed to gain compared with those in Group I (P < 0.05 for each comparison). The geese in Groups II and III had greater body-size measurements (half-diving length, body length, keel length, and shank circumference), heavier viscera (heart, gizzard, proventriculus, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and cecum), greater slaughter yield (semi-eviscerated carcass yield, eviscerated carcass yield, and breast yield), lower serum levels of alanine transaminase, uric acid, and blood urea nitrogen, and higher serum levels of glucose and high-density lipoprotein compared with those in Group I (P < 0.05 for each comparison). The geese in Groups II and III exhibited greater utilization of energy and crude protein compared with those in Group I (P < 0.05). Taken together, the results suggest that the low-fiber diet had negative effects on growth performance, slaughter performance, serum biochemical parameters, and nutrient utilization. As herbivorous poultry, geese depend on dietary fiber for normal performance. Dietary fiber is thus an essential nutrient for geese.

This study aimed at the reproductive endocrine profile under a natural photoperiod in Yangzhou female geese. Geese in the breeding industry were exposed to a natural photoperiod and the results showed the breeding season of Yangzhou geese initiated in autumn, reached peak in February and March, and terminated in June. Fifteen female geese were randomly selected for blood collection samples monthly. The results showed serum luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations in female geese were higher in the breeding season than in the non-breeding season. The concentrations of Prolactin (PRL) were also high in the breeding season. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations were high from March to May and decreased to low levels in other periods. Furthermore, 6 female birds were selected randomly monthly, sacrificed, and the hypothalamus and pituitary isolated. The expressions of FSH were also high in the breeding season, while the expressions of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) fluctuated. These results indicated that the reproductive hormones and their transcript expressions were closely related to the reproductive activities in Yangzhou geese.

Two goose megriviruses (W18 and HN56) were detected and sequenced. Both viruses possessed megrivirus-like genomic features, including unusually long genomes (9840 and 10 101 nt). W18 and HN56 were very similar to duck megrivirus (DMV) in the P2 and P3 regions, but much less similar in the P1 and 2A1 regions. HN56 may be a potential recombinant virus, with a distinct P1 region possibly originating from an unknown picornavirus. W18 may represent a novel type of DMV, showing a P1 sequence identity of 67 %. Similar levels (64-68 %) of P1 sequence identity were also displayed by melegrivirus A with W18 and DMV, demonstrating an equal genetic separation of the capsid region among W18, DMV and melegrivirus A. For the 2A1 region, the divergence among W18, HN56 and DMV was remarkable, involving point mutations and a long insertion/deletion. The present work contributes to the understanding of unique features and phylogeny of megriviruses.

Waterfowl undergo an annual simultaneous flight-feather moult that renders them flightless for the duration of the regrowth of the flight feathers. In the wild, this period of flightlessness could restrict the capacity of moulting birds to forage and escape predation. Selection might therefore favour a short moult, but feather growth is constrained and presumably energetically demanding. We therefore tested the hypothesis that for birds that undergo a simultaneous flight-feather moult, this would be the period in the annual cycle with the highest minimum daily heart rates, reflecting these increased energetic demands. Implantable heart rate data loggers were used to record year-round heart rate in six wild barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis), a species that undergoes a simultaneous flight-feather moult. The mean minimum daily heart rate was calculated for each individual bird over an 11-month period, and the annual cycle was divided into seasons based on the life-history of the birds. Mean minimum daily heart rate varied significantly between seasons and was significantly elevated during wing moult, to 200 ± 32 beats min-1, compared to all other seasons of the annual cycle, including both the spring and autumn migrations. The increase in minimum daily heart rate during moult is likely due to feather synthesis, thermoregulation and the reallocation of minerals and protein.

This experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of stocking density on the growth performance, feather growth, intestinal development, and serum parameters of geese. In total, 336 healthy, 28-day-old, male Yangzhou goslings were randomly allotted to 30 plastic wire-floor pens according to 5 stocking densities (2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 birds/m2). The results showed that with the stocking density increased from 2 birds/m2 to 6 birds/m2, the body weights of geese at 42 d (P < 0.001) and 70 d (P < 0.001) were reduced by 10.53% and 10.43% respectively, the primary feather lengths of geese at 42 d (P < 0.001) and 70 d (P = 0.021) were reduced by 20.38% and 6.62% respectively, whereas the feed/gain ratios for 28- to 42-d period and 28- to 70-d period increased from 2.50 to 2.90 (P = 0.001), and 3.80 to 4.24 (P < 0.001), respectively. The relative weights of the jejunum, ileum, and small intestine and the lengths of the jejunum, ileum, and small intestine were all adversely affected (P < 0.05) when stocking density was increased to 6 birds/m2. Serum concentrations of alkaline phosphatase (P = 0.013) and triiodothyronine (P < 0.001) decreased as the stocking density increased. The serum thyroxine concentration of geese from the 6 birds/m2 group was lower than that of geese from the other groups (P < 0.05). The reduction in thyroid hormone concentrations was similar to what was observed in growth rate. All the results suggested that high stocking density will adversely influence thyroid function and the developments of the body weight, body size, feathers, and small intestine. Under our experimental conditions, we recommend that the stocking density of geese should be kept to 5 or fewer birds/m2 to avoid the negative effects of high stocking density on geese.

Cottonseed meal (CSM), an oil industry by-product, is an attractive alternative protein source in poultry diets. To investigate the effects of CSM on growth performance, small intestinal morphology, digestive enzyme activities, and serum biochemical parameters of geese, a total of 300 healthy, 28-day-old, male Jiangnan geese were randomly divided into 5 treatments, with 6 pens of 10 geese each. Five isonitrogenous and isocaloric experimental diets were formulated to produce diets in which 0% (control), 25% (CSM25), 50% (CSM50), 75% (CSM75), and 100% (CSM100) of protein from soybean meal was replaced by CSM (corresponding to 0, 6.73, 13.46, 20.18, and 26.91% CSM in the feed, respectively). At 28, 42, and 70 d, BW and feed intake for each pen were measured. Blood, small intestine, and chyme samples were collected at 70 d. The results showed that dietary 13.46% CSM or more decreased BW at 42 d and ADG from 28 to 42 d but increased the feed/gain ratio (F/G) from 28 to 42 d (P < 0.05). From 42 to 70 d, geese in the CSM groups had higher ADFI and ADG than those of the control group (P < 0.05). Geese in the CSM75 and CSM100 groups had a higher ADG from 28 to 70 d and BW at 70 d and a lower F/G from 42 to 70 d than those of the control group (P < 0.05). Dietary 6.73% CSM also improved ADFI from 28 to 70 d (P < 0.05). Compared to the control, geese in the CSM groups had decreased pepsin and lipase activities, and those in the CSM25, CSM50, and CSM75 groups had increased villus height in the jejunum at 70 d (P < 0.05). All groups had similar concentrations of total protein, blood urea nitrogen, uric acid, cholesterol, triglyceride, calcium, and phosphorus in serum (P > 0.05). In conclusion, excessive use of CSM (>6.73%) decreased growth performance at an early age (28 to 42 d) in geese, whereas 6.73 to 26.91% CSM in feed improved growth performance from 28 to 70 d.

The impacts of hybridization on the process of speciation are manifold, leading to distinct patterns across the genome. Genetic differentiation accumulates in certain genomic regions, while divergence is hampered in other regions by homogenizing gene flow, resulting in a heterogeneous genomic landscape. A consequence of this heterogeneity is that genomes are mosaics of different gene histories that can be compared to unravel complex speciation and hybridization events. However, incomplete lineage sorting (often the outcome of rapid speciation) can result in similar patterns. New statistical techniques, such as the D-statistic and hybridization networks, can be applied to disentangle the contributions of hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting. We unravel patterns of hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting during and after the diversification of the True Geese (family Anatidae, tribe Anserini, genera Anser and Branta) using an exon-based hybridization network approach and taking advantage of discordant gene tree histories by re-sequencing all taxa of this clade. In addition, we determine the timing of introgression and reconstruct historical effective population sizes for all goose species to infer which demographic or biogeographic factors might explain the observed patterns of introgression.

As a key member of the cytochrome P450 gene superfamily, CYP17 gene encodes 17α-hydroxylase/C17,20-lyase that is critical for directing androgen synthesis. The CYP17 gene has been identified in several species, yet little is known about its distribution and expression profile during goose follicular development. In the present study, we obtained the full-length coding sequence of goose CYP17 (gCYP17) gene for the first time using RACE method. Its sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis suggested that gCYP17 was highly conserved with those of other birds and consisted of four main functional domains like other species. Results from immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting suggested that gCYP17 was predominantly located in theca interna throughout follicular development. Furthermore, levels of gCYP17 reached the maximum in theca layer of the 6-8 mm follicles which were significantly higher than in those of other follicles (P < 0.05). In addition, gCYP17 was expressed at much higher levels in the F4 theca layer than the F1 follicle (P < 0.05). Therefore, these results indicated that the fluctuating expression pattern and specific cellular localization of gCYP17 during follicular development might be closely related to androgen secretion, and thereby follicular maturation.

The present study aimed to investigate the influence of feed form and the level of dietary crude protein (CP) on the growth performance and carcass traits of growing geese. A total of 180 Egyptian geese (1 wk old) were randomly divided into 9 groups (20 chicks per group). Each group was subdivided into five replicates, with 4 birds per replicate. A 3 × 3 factorial experiment was performed with 3 types of diets (pellets, crumble, and mash) and 3 levels of dietary CP (22%, 20%, and 18% during the starter period and 20%, 18%, and 16% during the finisher period). The type of feed had significant (P ≤ 0.05) effects on body weight, body weight gain (ADG), the feed conversion ratio (FCR), and the protein efficiency ratio (PER) during all experimental periods, except ADG and PER from the 8th to 12th week. Dietary CP levels had significant effects on feed consumption (FC), FCR, and PER (p < 0.05 or 0.01) except from the 1st to 7th week for FC, 8th to 12th week for FCR, and 1st to 7th week for PER. Carcass, liver, heart, dressing, and wings (%) were found to be significantly (P < 0.01) improved in geese fed pellets compared to geese fed other types of diets. Birds fed a high-CP diet featured the highest (P < 0.05) values for liver, gizzard, heart, and giblets compared to the other groups at 12 wk of age. In conclusion, the present findings show that pellet and crumble feed are better than mash feed for promoting the growth of growing geese from the 1st to 12th week of age. The optimal dietary CP requirements for growing geese from the 1st to 7th and 8th to 12th weeks of age are 18% and 16%, respectively.

Cassava foliage is a by-product of cassava and has been widely used in animal feed. However, little information is available on its utilization for geese. In this study, we investigated the effects of cassava foliage on the performance, carcass characteristics, and gastrointestinal tract development of geese. A total of 108 28-day-old Hainan indigenous male geese with similar body weight were randomly divided into 3 groups with 6 pens of 6 geese per group and fed for 42 D on either the control diet of ground maize, soybean meal, and wheat bran or the experimental diet of ground maize, soybean meal, and wheat bran supplemented with 5% or 10% cassava foliage, respectively. On day 70, their body weight (BW), average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), feed conversion ratio (FCR), carcass characteristics, and gastrointestinal tract development were compared. The results showed that cassava foliage diet significantly improved goose's BW (P < 0.05), ADG (P < 0.05), and ADFI (P < 0.05), affected carcass characteristics such as relative meat content (P < 0.05) and abdominal fat content (P < 0.05), and facilitated goose's gastrointestinal tract development. These findings suggested that incorporating cassava foliage into the diet of geese (day 28-70) could have positive effects, and supplementing 5% cassava foliage was more beneficial than 10%.

During the winter of 2013-14, 22 Canada geese ( Branta canadensis ) were admitted to the Wildlife Clinic at the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University with nonspecific neurologic abnormalities and emaciation. Five of these geese, along with three geese that were submitted dead, were evaluated via histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) for bornaviruses. Histopathologically, six of the eight birds had lymphoplasmacytic encephalitis. One bird, which also had encephalitis, had a dilated esophagus. Lead poisoning, West Nile virus, avian influenza, and avian paramyxovirus infection were excluded from the diagnosis. Brain tissue from all eight geese was positive for bornaviral N-antigen on immunohistochemistry. Frozen brain tissue from five birds was available for bornavirus RT-PCR. Three of the five birds were positive for the bornavirus M gene. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded brain tissue was evaluated on the remaining three geese via RT-PCR, with one of these geese testing positive. A bornavirus was subsequently cultured in duck embryo fibroblasts from the brain of one Canada Goose. This virus genome was sequenced, and the virus was identified as aquatic bird bornavirus 1. We were unable to identify any unusual features of this genome that would account for its apparent pathogenicity, given that subclinical infection with bornavirus in waterfowl is common in North America.

The identification of genetic markers is valuable for improving the egg-laying performance in goose production. The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1714766362 in an intron of the goose KIAA1462 gene was found to be relevant to laying performance in our previous study. However, its function remains unclear. In this study, the full-length coding sequence of KIAA1462 gene was firstly characterized in Yangzhou geese. Q-PCR (Quantitative Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction) results showed that KIAA1462 was highly expressed in the liver, ovary, and mature F1 follicles. For SNP rs1714766362, geese with the AA genotype showed better laying performance than the TT ones and exhibited a higher KIAA1462 expression level in the ovary. Gain- and loss-of function experiments in granulosa cells revealed that KIAA1462 affected the expression of the apoptosis marker gene caspase-3. Considering that rs1714766362 locates in an intron area, we compared the KIAA1462 promoter regions of AA and TT individuals and identified the SNP c.-413C>G (Genbank ss2137504176), which was completely linked to SNP rs1714766362. According to the transcription factor prediction results, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) would bind to the SNP site containing the C but not the G allele. In this study, we proved this hypothesis by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). In summary, we identified a novel mutation in the promoter of KIAA1462 gene which can modulate GR binding affinity and affect the laying performance of geese.

Migratory connectivity by birds may mutually affect different ecosystems over large distances. Populations of geese overwintering in southern areas while breeding in high-latitude ecosystems have increased strongly over the past decades. The increase is likely due to positive feedbacks caused by climate change at both wintering, stopover sites and breeding grounds, land-use practices at the overwintering grounds and protection from hunting. Here we show how increasing goose populations in temperate regions, and increased breeding success in the Arctic, entail a positive feedback with strong impacts on Arctic freshwater ecosystems in the form of eutrophication. This may again strongly affect community composition and productivity of the ponds, due to increased nutrient loadings or birds serving as vectors for new species.

The Netherlands is important for wintering migratory herbivorous geese, numbers of which have rapidly increased, leading to conflict with agriculture. In 2005/2006, a new goose management policy aimed to limit compensation payments to farmers by concentrating foraging geese in 80 000 ha of designated 'go' areas-where farmers received payment to accommodate them-and scaring geese from 'no go' areas elsewhere. Monthly national counts of four abundant goose species during 10 years prior to the new policy and in 8 years following implementation found that 57% of all goose days were spent within 'go' areas under the new management, the same as prior to implementation. Such lack of response suggests no predicted learning effects, perhaps because of (i) increases in abundance outside of 'go' areas, (ii) irregularly shaped boundaries and enclaves of 'no go' farmland within 'go' areas and/or (iii) insufficient differences in disturbance levels within and outside designated areas.

Phylogenetic incongruence can be caused by analytical shortcomings or can be the result of biological processes, such as hybridization, incomplete lineage sorting and gene duplication. Differentiation between these causes of incongruence is essential to unravel complex speciation and diversification events. The phylogeny of the True Geese (tribe Anserini, Anatidae, Anseriformes) was, until now, contentious, i.e., the phylogenetic relationships and the timing of divergence between the different goose species could not be fully resolved. We sequenced nineteen goose genomes (representing seventeen species of which three subspecies of the Brent Goose, Branta bernicla) and used an exon-based phylogenomic approach (41,736 exons, representing 5887 genes) to unravel the evolutionary history of this bird group. We thereby provide general guidance on the combination of whole genome evolutionary analyses and analytical tools for such cases where previous attempts to resolve the phylogenetic history of several taxa could not be unravelled. Identical topologies were obtained using either a concatenation (based upon an alignment of 6,630,626 base pairs) or a coalescent-based consensus method. Two major lineages, corresponding to the genera Anser and Branta, were strongly supported. Within the Branta lineage, the White-cheeked Geese form a well-supported sub-lineage that is sister to the Red-breasted Goose (Branta ruficollis). In addition, two main clades of Anser species could be identified, the White Geese and the Grey Geese. The results from the consensus method suggest that the diversification of the genus Anser is heavily influenced by rapid speciation and by hybridization, which may explain the failure of previous studies to resolve the phylogenetic relationships within this genus. The majority of speciation events took place in the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene (between 4 and 2millionyears ago), conceivably driven by a global cooling trend that led to the establishment of a circumpolar tundra belt and the emergence of temperate grasslands. Our approach will be a fruitful strategy for resolving many other complex evolutionary histories at the level of genera, species, and subspecies.

In the present study the melatonin receptor 1A gene (MTNR1A) was proposed to be a candidate gene for egg production in Yangzhou geese. A total of 210 goose blood samples were collected to investigate the association of the MTNR1A gene with the number of eggs produced. Using a direct sequencing method, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; g.177G>C) was detected in the 5' regulatory region of the MTNR1A gene (Genbank ss1985399687). Two alleles (G and C) and three genotypes were identified. Association analysis results showed that the g.177G>C SNP significantly affected the level of egg production within a 34-week egg-laying period (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the geese with the GG genotype produced significantly more eggs compared to the geese with the CC genotype. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that the MTNR1A gene was highly expressed in small intestine, granulosa cell and ovary compared to other examined tissues. In addition, the mRNA expression level of MTNR1A in ovary indicated that significantly higher expression levels were recorded for geese with the GG genotype compared to those with the CC genotype. Moreover, a luciferase reporter assay showed that the CC genotype had significantly lower promoter activity than did GG. These results suggest that the identified SNP in the MTNR1A gene may influence the number of eggs produced and mRNA expression levels in Yangzhou geese and could be considered as a useful molecular marker in goose selection and improvement, especially for egg production.

In the present study, the process of feather follicle formation in the Zi goose, a Chinese indigenous breed, was investigated during various stages of embryonic development by using a modified histological processing method. The results showed that the feather placodes evolved initially at embryonic day (E) 12 on the spinal feather tract, emerging as symmetrical structures. Sequentially, the buds elongated from E14 to E16 with anterior-posterior and proximal-distal asymmetries, and invaginated to form the primary feather follicles, which were identified to develop the contour feathers or remiges. The remarkable observation at this stage was the formation of the feather follicle wall, which was understood to be the result of the epidermis surrounding the base and further invaginating into the dermis. With the differentiation of the barbule plates, the various types of feathers were determined. We proved that the secondary feather follicles simply had radially symmetrical barb ridges, with much smaller diameters than the primary follicles, and that they developed only downy feathers. The primary and secondary follicles evolved independently of each other and formed ranks in a linear fashion. Moreover, quantitative measurements of the densities of both follicles confirmed that the density of the primary follicles sharply reached the maximum at E18, and then decreased gradually. Coincidentally, the secondary follicles started to increase from the age of E18, and up to E26 the density of the secondary follicles exceeded that of the primary follicles. Each of the primary feather follicles was richly encircled with muscles, which pointed to a quadrangularly arranged network in the dermis. The present work lays the foundation for further study of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of feather follicle morphogenesis in geese.

Geese have a short egg-laying period and a low egg production rate. To induce and maintain egg laying, genes related to generating hepatic lipid for yolk deposition should be adequately expressed. Liver mRNA from 6 laying geese was extracted and used for construction of a full-length enriched cDNA library. About 2,400 clones containing gene sequences were determined and National Center for Biotechnology Information Gallus gallus Gene Index databases were used to compare and analyze these sequences. Ten highly expressed genes were selected to determine the differential expression between laying and prelay goose liver. Tissue distribution data showed that very low density apolipoprotein II, liver type fatty acid binding protein, vitellogenin I, and vitellogenin II transcripts were specifically expressed in the liver of laying geese. Ovoinhibitor, preproalbumin, alpha-2-hs-glycoprotein, and vitamin D binding protein mRNA were highly expressed in the liver and to a lesser extent in other tissues. Ovotransferrin mRNA was expressed in liver, ovary, oviduct, shell gland, brain, and adipose tissues. The concentration of transthyretin mRNA was high in the liver and brain. The mRNA concentrations of liver type fatty acid binding protein, alpha-2-hs-glycoprotein, and transthyretin in the livers of laying and prelay geese were not different. The concentrations of hepatic ovotransferrin, ovoinhibitor, preproalbumin, very low density apolipoprotein II, vitellogenin I, vitellogenin II, and vitamin D binding protein mRNA were higher in the liver of laying geese than in prelay geese, suggesting that these genes may be involved in laying function or lipid metabolism related to egg formation.

1. In a previous study, a laying-related single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) Record-106975 (A-G) was found in the intron of Membrane-associated Guanylate Kinase with Inverted Domain Structure-1 (MAGI1) gene by restriction site-associated DNA sequencing. This study was performed to further identify the function of MAGI1 on laying performance in Yangzhou geese. 2. The complete MAGI1 cDNA sequence was cloned from the ovary of the Yangzhou goose. A total of 4 alternative splice variants were identified, and the characterisation of their nucleic acid and amino acid (AA) sequences were analysed. The AA sequence of goose MAGI1 was highly conserved with other avian species. 3. MAGI1 was ubiquitously expressed in 11 tested tissues, with greater amounts of mRNA in the granulosa cell layer and ovary. GG (n = 14) and GA (n = 6) genotypes of SNP Record-106975 showed significantly lower MAGI1 mRNA levels than those of the AA genotype. 4. Over-expression and knockdown experiments revealed that MAGI1 mRNA expression was associated with caspase-3 mRNA levels in granulosa cells, and may play a role in regulating apoptosis of granulosa cells.

1. Highly palatable and nutritious meat products can be produced through dietary interventions. Previous studies have shown that forage feeding has a significant impact on the growth performance and nutrition of cattle in various regions, but whether the same effects can be induced in geese remains unclear. 2. Three hundred and sixty Yangzhou goslings were divided according to body weight at 29 d old, assigned to one of 4 treatments and raised in separate pens. The treatments applied were (A) grazing, (B) grazing, grain supplemental diet (64 to 70 d), (C) grazing, grain supplemental diet and (D) confined. 3. Eviscerated carcass yield was lower in the grazing treatment. Protein content and muscle collagen in both the breast and thigh muscles were significantly higher in the grazing treatment than the confined, while fat content exhibited the opposite tendency. Those fed on grass and supplementary grain had a higher Mg and Cu content in breast muscle. 4. Geese will grow to their full potential when they are allowed to consume grass from pasture supplemented with grain, protein, collagen, Mg and Cu content was greater to a degree, which suggests this feeding regime is an ideal model for goose production.

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of corn silage and quantitative feed restriction on BW, ADG, feed conversion, and carcass composition of White Kołuda W31 geese. Two diets were fed during the rearing period from 22 to 98 d of age: 1) a commercial diet ad libitum, and 2) restricted amounts of a commercial diet and corn silage ad libitum. Each treatment had 2 replicates of 16 birds each. From 99 to 119 d of age, all birds were fattened with whole oat grain alone. Incorporation of corn silage reduced weight gains and caused statistically significant differences in BW at the end of the rearing period (14 wk, 6,625.0 vs. 6,050.0 g; P < 0.05). Experimental geese showed compensatory growth during the oat fattening period and the BW of geese from both groups was similar at the end of the study (17 wk, 7,675.1 vs. 7,467.9 g; P > 0.05). Daily weight gains varied with week of growth, being lowest at 12 wk of age. Birds fed the commercial diet and corn silage had a significantly longer trunk (29.2 vs. 31.0 cm, P < 0.05) and shorter shanks (10.0 vs. 9.4 cm, P < 0.05) at 8 wk, and significantly smaller chest circumference (54.7 vs. 51.9 cm, P < 0.05) at the end of 14 wk. At the end of oat feeding (17 wk), geese receiving silage had significantly longer trunk and drumstick compared with geese fed commercial diets alone. The carcasses of 17-wk-old experimental geese contained more breast and leg muscles (%), and less skin with subcutaneous fat from breast and legs compared with control birds. Significant differences were only noted between the groups in dressing percentage (65.0 vs. 74.7%, P < 0.05) and proportion of skin with subcutaneous fat from breast (8.9 vs. 7.8%, P < 0.05). Dilution of the diet for young fattening geese with whole-crop corn silage had a positive effect on production economics and carcass composition.

Chronic stress--or, more appropriately, "allostatic overload"--may be physiologically harmful and can cause death in the most severe cases. Animals in captivity are thought to be particularly vulnerable to allostatic overload due to artificial housing and group makeup. Here we attempted to determine if captive greylag geese (Anser anser), housed lifelong in captivity, showed elevated levels of immunoreactive corticosterone metabolites (CORT) and ectoparasites in dropping samples as well as some hematological parameters (hematocrit, packed cell volume, total white blood cell count [TWBC], and heterophil:lymphocyte ratio [H:L]). All of these have been measured as indicators of chronic stress. Furthermore, we correlated the various stress parameters within individuals. Captive geese showed elevated values of CORT and ectoparasites relative to a wild population sampled in the vicinity of the area where the captive flock is held. The elevated levels, however, were by no means at a pathological level and fall well into the range of other published values in wild greylag geese. We found no correlations between any of the variables measured from droppings with any of the ones collected from blood. Among the blood parameters, only the H:L negatively correlated with TWBC. We examine the problem of inferring allostatic overload when measuring only 1 stress parameter, as there is no consistency between various measurements taken. We discuss the different aspects of each of the parameters measured and the extensive individual variation in response to stress as well as the timing at which different systems respond to a stressor and what is actually measured at the time of data collection. We conclude that measuring only 1 stress parameter often is insufficient to evaluate the well-being of both wild and captively housed animals and that collecting behavioral data on stress might be a suitable addition.

The purpose of this study was to detect differential expression of genes in the pituitary gland in laying geese by suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH). Pituitary glands from prelaying and laying geese were dissected for mRNA extraction. The cDNA from pituitary glands of prelaying geese was subtracted from the cDNA from the pituitary glands of laying geese (forward subtraction); the reverse subtraction was also performed. We screened 384 clones with possible differentially expressed gene fragments by differential screening. Sixty-five clones from the differential screening results were subjected to gene sequencing and further analysis. We found that at least 19 genes were highly expressed in the pituitary glands of laying geese compared with prelaying geese. Among these, 6 genes (including 4 novel genes) were confirmed by virtual Northern analysis. We found that prolactin and visinin-like protein were highly expressed in the pituitary glands of laying geese compared with prelaying geese (P < 0.05). Further investigation is needed to demonstrate specific functions of the novel genes discovered in the current study.

The aim of this work was to study the effects of incorporating sugar beet pulp (SBP) into the diet of geese in two feeding systems (complete pelleted feed or loose-mix feeding system) on crop development and performance. A total of 480 1-d-old male geese were divided into three groups whose diet differed from d 56 to 90: a complete pelleted diet containing 50% corn (control diet: AMEn 11.5 MJ/kg; CP 161 g/kg), and no SBP; a complete pelleted diet containing 50% corn and 10% SBP (SBPcp diet: AMEn: 11.5 MJ/kg; CP: 161 g/kg); and a mix in the same feeder (SBPlm diet) of 500 g/kg of protein-rich pellets containing 20% SBP (SBPprp: AMEn: 9.0 MJ/kg; CP: 250 g/kg) and 500 g/kg of whole corn (WC: AMEn: 14.0 MJ/kg; CP: 72 g/kg). Body traits, including crop volume, were measured at d 91. From d 91 to 106, 88 birds/group were overfed with a mixture containing mainly corn and water before slaughter to measure fatty liver performance. Feed intake from d 56 to 90 was higher (+10%; P = 0.004) in the SBPcp group than the other two, but at d 90, the body weight (BW) of the birds was higher (+7%; P = 0.002) in the SBPlm group than the other two. At d 91, the volume of the crop was greater in the SBPcp group (80.4 mL/kg of BW, P < 0.001) than in the control group (60.3 mL/kg of BW), the SBPlm group being intermediate (64.1 mL/kg of BW). Feed intake (13,321 g), weight gain (2,733 g), and feed-to-gain ratio (4.9) during the overfeeding period, as well as fatty liver weight (963 g) and commercial grading, were similar (P > 0.05) between the three groups. In conclusion, the use of sugar beet pulp in the diet of finishing geese helps the adaptation of the digestive tract to the overfeeding period, even in a loose-mix feeding system based on whole corn.

Bar-headed geese (Anser indicus) fly at high altitudes during their migration across the Himalayas and Tibetan plateau. However, we know relatively little about whether rearing at high altitude (i.e. phenotypic plasticity) facilitates this impressive feat because most of what is known about their physiology comes from studies performed at sea level. To provide this information, a comprehensive analysis of metabolic, cardiovascular and ventilatory responses to progressive decreases in the equivalent fractional composition of inspired oxygen (FiO2 : 0.21, 0.12, 0.09, 0.07 and 0.05) was made on bar-headed geese reared at either high altitude (3200 m) or low altitude (0 m) and on barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis), a low-altitude migrating species, reared at low altitude (0 m). Bar-headed geese reared at high altitude exhibited lower metabolic rates and a modestly increased hypoxic ventilatory response compared with low-altitude-reared bar-headed geese. Although the in vivo oxygen equilibrium curves and blood-oxygen carrying capacity did not differ between the two bar-headed goose study groups, the blood-oxygen carrying capacity was higher than that of barnacle geese. Resting cardiac output also did not differ between groups and increased at least twofold during progressive hypoxia, initially as a result of increases in stroke volume. However, cardiac output increased at a higher FiO2  threshold in bar-headed geese raised at high altitude. Thus, bar-headed geese reared at high altitude exhibited a reduced oxygen demand at rest and a modest but significant increase in oxygen uptake and delivery during progressive hypoxia compared with bar-headed geese reared at low altitude.

Laying performance is an important economical trait of goose production. As laying performance is of low heritability, it is of significance to develop a marker-assisted selection (MAS) strategy for this trait. Definition of sequence variation related to the target trait is a prerequisite of quantitating MAS, but little is presently known about the goose genome, which greatly hinders the identification of genetic markers for the laying traits of geese. Recently developed restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing is a possible approach for discerning large-scale single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and reducing the complexity of a genome without having reference genomic information available. In the present study, we developed a pooled RAD sequencing strategy for detecting geese laying-related SNP. Two DNA pools were constructed, each consisting of equal amounts of genomic DNA from 10 individuals with either high estimated breeding value (HEBV) or low estimated breeding value (LEBV). A total of 139,013 SNP were obtained from 42,291,356 sequences, of which 18,771,943 were for LEBV and 23,519,413 were for HEBV cohorts. Fifty-five SNP which had different allelic frequencies in the two DNA pools were further validated by individual-based AS-PCR genotyping in the LEBV and HEBV cohorts. Ten out of 55 SNP exhibited distinct allele distributions in these two cohorts. These 10 SNP were further genotyped in a goose population of 492 geese to verify the association with egg numbers. The result showed that 8 of 10 SNP were associated with egg numbers. Additionally, liner regression analysis revealed that SNP Record-111407, 106975 and 112359 were involved in a multiplegene network affecting laying performance. We used IPCR to extend the unknown regions flanking the candidate RAD tags. The obtained sequences were subjected to BLAST to retrieve the orthologous genes in either ducks or chickens. Five novel genes were cloned for geese which harbored the candidate laying-related SNP, including membrane associated guanylate kinase (MAGI-1), KIAA1462, Rho GTPase activating protein 21 (ARHGAP21), acyl-CoA synthetase family member 2 (ACSF2), astrotactin 2 (ASTN2). Collectively, our data suggests that 8 SNP and 5 genes might be promising candidate markers or targets for marker-assisted selection of egg numbers in geese.

Geese form a fatty liver after feeding on a carbohydrate-rich diet, possibly as an evolutionary adaptation to accumulate reserves for migration. To gain insight into the gene-regulation processes of hepatic steatosis in geese, we examined the profile of transcriptional expression in goose fatty liver and control liver by suppression subtractive hybridization and measured the levels of serum biochemical variables. We found 107 genes whose expression was different between the treatment and control groups. The main functions of these genes are metabolic processes, including the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, and lipids. Twenty-four genes were classified using the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. Twelve genes that related to metabolic and cellular processes were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. A specific positive effect of feeding was observed on the expression of genes involved mainly in unsaturated fatty acids and triglyceride synthesis, and a negative effect was observed on genes involved in β-oxidation, cholesterol metabolism, and glycolysis. The results could serve as an important reference for the development of goose breeding for fatty liver production and human liver disease research.

beta-Catenin signaling has been reported to initiate feather bud development. In the present study, beta-catenin gene was isolated and identified from a cDNA library constructed using embryonic goose skin. Expression patterns of beta-catenin gene in the dorsal skin of goose embryos were investigated using the methods of semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR, Northern blot analysis, and in situ hybridization. The sequence of beta-catenin was found highly conserved at the amino acid level, sharing 100, 99, and 99% identity with chicken, Chinese soft-shell turtle, and human sequences, respectively. Relatively high levels (62.51 +/- 7.11% to 101.74 +/- 7.29%) of beta-catenin mRNA were detected in the dorsal skin samples. The levels of beta-catenin expression were most prominent at the early stage from embryo day (E)10 to E20 and then significantly declined with the embryonic development. In situ hybridization demonstrated that at E10, beta-catenin expression was mainly observed at the surface periderm cells and the localized region of the epidermal layer. Because feather bud forms with an anterior-posterior orientation, strong staining was observed in the periderm layer and in the ectoderm and epidermis with a diffuse distribution within the internal area of the buds. The stronger staining was seen in the barb ridges than in the center pulp of the feather follicles at E18 and E20. In this study, expression of Shh as a marker gene for the bud development was examined paralleling with expression patterns of beta-catenin. It was found that the expression pattern of beta-catenin was almost similar spatially and temporally to that of Shh mRNA at the later stages of bud development. The differential beta-catenin mRNA expression in the goose dorsal skin may be essential for promoting the normal development of embryonic feather bud.

The laying performance of poultry primarily depends on the growth and development of the ovarian follicles. Yet, little is known about the underlying mechanisms responsible for nonhierarchical follicular development in avian species. The aim of the present study is identify genes that are differentially expressed during nonhierarchical follicular development in geese by performing a transcriptome screen. A sequencing depth of 13.9 and 14.9 million mapped tags was obtained in pools of small white follicles (SWF) and small yellow follicles (SYF), respectively, and a total of 160 differentially expressed genes were identified. The fold-changes of eight differentially expressed genes, identified using qRT-PCR, were consistent with the Digital Gene Expression Profiling (DGE) data. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) analyses showed that lipid metabolism, steroid secretion, extracellular ligand reactions, enzyme activities, the cell cycle, ECM-receptor interactions and the extracellular matrix are involved in follicular development. The majority of the newly identified genes could be considered to be new candidate genes with potential roles in regulating follicular development. These results provide useful information for future in-depth studies associated with nonhierarchical follicular development in goose reproduction.

In this study, we evaluated the meat flavor compounds of Yangzhou geese, including one group of pedigree strain (AA group) and 4 groups of 2-strain crossbreds (KA, KB, CA, and SA). Each group consisted of 100 geese comprised of 5 replicates of 10 males and 10 females each. Inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP), amino acid (AA), and fatty acid (FA) levels in breast and thigh muscle were determined. Results showed that AA group had the highest levels of total amino acid (TAA) and dissolved free amino acids (DFAA) in breast muscle and of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in thigh muscle (P<0.05). In SA group, the levels of C17:1, C22:0, C22:1, C20:4, and C24:1 in breast muscle were significantly higher in SA than in other groups (P<0.05). KB group had the lowest glycine levels in breast muscle (P<0.05) while MUFA levels were significantly higher in KB than in other groups (P<0.05). In KA, the levels of C18:3 in breast muscle in were higher than in CA and KB (P<0.05). CA had relevant higher IMPc levels in breast muscle than SA (P<0.05) and other groups (P>0.05); however, no significant differences were obtained in thigh muscle (P>0.05). In conclusion, Yangzhou AA goose has high levels of meat flavor compounds than its crossbreeds. Future efforts should focus on assessing meat flavor through measurement of sensory characteristics of Yangzhou geese.

The phenomenon of multiple embryos in birds and other oviparous vertebrates is very rare and thus poorly studied. Some populations of wild birds or lines of poultry, including the zatorska goose, may be particularly predisposed to developing monovular twin embryos (MTE). The aim of the study was to investigate the frequency of single yolk twin embryos in the zatorska goose and to establish whether these embryos are generated as a result of polyembryony or other developmental anomalies.Embryopathological analysis, which included identification of the developmental stages of all MTEs at the time of death, was carried out on 1,955 unhatched eggs obtained from 20 pedigree breeding flocks of the zatorska goose. Post-mortem examinations revealed as many as 13 MTEs (0.66% compared to embryonated eggs) at varying developmental stages.The results of genotyping of the microsatellite loci of 7 pairs of twins demonstrated genetic similarity in 6 of them; this suggests that they developed from 1 blastoderm, while differences in 2 loci of 1 pair show that the MTE originates from 2 blastodiscs. Pedigree analysis of the MTEs does not provide evidence that predisposition toward twinning results from the genetic background. However, more frequent MTE occurrence could be seen in eggs stored for more than 8 d. It seems that embryos of the zatorska goose are more susceptible to duplication under special conditions, such as prolonged egg storage.

Wild geese foraging on farmland cause increasing conflicts with agricultural interests, calling for a strategic approach to mitigation. In central Norway, conflicts between farmers and spring-staging pink-footed geese feeding on pastures have escalated. To alleviate the conflict, a scheme by which farmers are subsidized to allow geese to forage undisturbed was introduced. To guide allocation of subsidies, an ecological-based ranking of fields at a regional level was recommended and applied. Here we evaluate the scheme. On average, 40 % of subsidized fields were in the top 5 % of the ranking, and 80 % were within the top 20 %. Goose grazing pressure on subsidized pastures was 13 times higher compared to a stratified random selection of non-subsidized pastures, capturing 67 % of the pasture feeding geese despite that subsidized fields only comprised 13 % of the grassland area. Close dialogue between scientists and managers is regarded as a key to the success of the scheme.

In this study, we isolated microsatellite DNA from the Huoyan goose genome with magnetic beads. As a result, 150 positive clones were identified, and 148 microsatellites were found. Among the 148 microsatellites, 69.6% were perfect, 17.6% were imperfect, and the rest were compound type (12.8%). Twenty microsatellite primers were used to screen 90 individuals from 3 Huoyan goose populations. Eight loci were polymorphic with a low number of alleles (2 to 4). The observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.3556 to 1 and from 0.2923 to 0.6868, respectively. All the 8 polymorphic loci were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. These molecular markers will be useful for future studies on population genetic structure and conservation genetics in Huoyan geese.

This paper reviews the changing status of goose populations in Scotland since the 1940s, and the changing policies and management activities employed over that time. The size of all goose populations has risen since the 1940s due to protection measures, changes in agriculture and levels of shooting, in the UK and elsewhere. The development of goose policies in response to public interest and pressures is described. Some changes in goose populations since 2000 can be linked to this policy development. Policy is now split between protective measures for some species and adaptive management approaches encompassing control measures for others. The paper identifies the importance of the social and economic concerns of some parties in the development of goose management approaches, rather than scientific advice based on goose population numbers and trends, and recognises that future goose policy will necessarily be a difficult compromise between wide ranging, and even opposing positions and views.

High-throughput RNA sequencing was performed for comprehensively analyzing the transcriptome of geese. A total of 28,803,759 bp of raw sequence data was generated by 454 GS Flx+. After removal of adaptor sequences, 28,730,361 bp remained and 117,279 reads were obtained, with an average length of 244 bases. Simultaneously, complementary DNA samples from two different reproductive stages of goose ovarian, hypothalamus and pituitary tissue were sequenced separately using Illumina MiSeq platform. A total of 12 688 673 148 bp of raw sequence data were generated by Illumina MiSeq. After removal of adaptor sequences, 8 198 126 562 bp remained and 60 382 786 clean reads were obtained, with an average length of 135 bases. Assembly of all the reads from both 454 Flx+ and Illumina platforms formed 56,839 contigs. The sequence size ranges from 38 to 28,206 bp in size, with an average size of 2584 bp and an N50 of 4624. The assembly produced a substantial number of large contigs: 35,545 (62.5%) were longer than 1 kb, of which 8850 (15.6%) were longer than 5 kb. The sequencing depth was 85 X on average. We performed comprehensive function annotations on unigenes including protein sequence similarity, gene ontology (GO) term classification, and Kyoto Encylcopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment. GO analysis showed that approximately 63% of the contigs had annotation information, among the 35,953 annotated isotigs in Nr database, 24,783 (68.9%) sequences were assigned with one or more GO terms. There were 14,634 (40.7%) isotigs for biological processes, 10,557(29.3%) isotigs for cellular component, 22,607 (62.9%) isotigs for molecular function. The result of KEGG pathway mapping 8926 sequences had the pathway annotation, and took part in 477 pathways. Additionally, 10,685 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were identified from the assembled sequences. The most frequent repeat motifs were trinucleotides, which accounted for 53.03% of all SSRs, followed by dinucleotides (39.9%), tetranucleotides (5.08%), pentanucleotides (1.68%) and hexanucleotides (0.32%). Transcriptome sequencing on mixture issue of the geese yielded substantial transcriptional sequences and potentially useful SSR markers which provide an important data source for geese research.

The aim of this study was to estimate the genetic parameters and inbreeding effect on the fertility, embryo mortality and hatchability traits in the Zatorska goose covered by the animal genetic resources conservation program. The material for this study contains information about results of hatching of 18 863 eggs from 721 dams and 168 sires, laid between 1998-2015. Genetic parameters were estimated based on the threshold animal model by the use of Restricted Maximum Likelihood and Gibbs sampling. The percentage of fertilized eggs ranged yearly between 37-80%. The percentage of embryo mortality was very low, ranging between 4.63-23.73%. The percentage of the hatched goslings from the total number of analyzed eggs was on average 33.18%, and 53.72% from fertilized eggs. On average based on both methods, the heritability estimates of the fertility, embryo mortality and hatchability reached 0.36, 0.07, 0.24 for males and 0.44, 0.11, 0.32 for females. The genetic trend had increasing tendency for fertility and hatchability and was stable for embryo mortality for both sexes. The obtained result shows that the Zatorska goose can be still maintained in the reserves of the local gene pool according to current rules and use in the local market as a breed with good reproductive potential.

The parts of carcasses of slaughtered animals that are not intended for human consumption are referred to as inedible components. The total percentage of edible to inedible components in the carcasses of different poultry species is an important economic consideration. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of age on the growth rate of tissues and organs and the percentage change in edible to inedible components in geese. A flock of 240 Polish Koluda White geese was raised to 12 wk of age. The percentage content of edible components increased (P < 0.001) and the percentage content of inedible parts decreased (P < 0.001) as the birds grew older. Among edible components, the most considerable changes were noted in the growth rates of muscle tissue (10.5% increase; P < 0.001) and giblets (5.1% decrease; P < 0.001). The percentage share of muscle tissue increased to 10 wk of age. Lean meat weight increased from 175 g in wk 2 to 1,482 g in wk 12. The increase in lean meat weight varied considerably between body parts. The proportion of breast muscles in total meat weight increased substantially (by 26%), whereas the proportion of leg muscles decreased (by 34%). An increase in the weight of skin with subcutaneous fat was observed until the end of the rearing period, but the percentage content of this component remained at a similar level throughout the experiment (19.1 to 19.6%). The decrease in the percentage content of inedible components was mostly due to a decrease in the share of slaughter offal (by approximately 6.5%) because the proportion of bones remained at a stable level (approximately 11.9 to 11.5%). The weight of abdominal fat, which can be classified as edible or inedible, increased significantly with age, from 15.1 g in wk 2 to 205.1 g in wk 12, accounting for 1.6% and 4.0% total BW, respectively.

Quantifying spatial patterns of bird nests and nest fate provides insights into processes influencing a species' distribution. At Cape Churchill, Manitoba, Canada, recent declines in breeding Eastern Prairie Population Canada geese (Branta canadensis interior) has coincided with increasing populations of nesting lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) and Ross's geese (Chen rossii). We conducted a spatial analysis of point patterns using Canada goose nest locations and nest fate, and lesser snow goose nest locations at two study areas in northern Manitoba with different densities and temporal durations of sympatric nesting Canada and lesser snow geese. Specifically, we assessed (1) whether Canada geese exhibited territoriality and at what scale and nest density; and (2) whether spatial patterns of Canada goose nest fate were associated with the density of nesting lesser snow geese as predicted by the protective-association hypothesis. Between 2001 and 2007, our data suggest that Canada geese were territorial at the scale of nearest neighbors, but were aggregated when considering overall density of conspecifics at slightly broader spatial scales. The spatial distribution of nest fates indicated that lesser snow goose nest proximity and density likely influence Canada goose nest fate. Our analyses of spatial point patterns suggested that continued changes in the distribution and abundance of breeding lesser snow geese on the Hudson Bay Lowlands may have impacts on the reproductive performance of Canada geese, and subsequently the spatial distribution of Canada goose nests.

We here review the collision risks posed by large-bodied, flocking geese to aircraft, exacerbated by recent major increases in northern hemisphere goose populations and air traffic volume. Mitigation of goose-aircraft strike risks requires knowledge of local goose movements, global goose population dynamics and ecology. Airports can minimise goose strikes by managing habitats within the airport property, applying deterrents to scare geese away and lethal control, but goose migration and movements at greater spatial scales present greater challenges. Habitat management outside of airports can locally reduce goose attractiveness of peripheral areas, but requires stakeholder involvement and coordination. Information on bird strike rates, individual goose movements and goose population dynamics is essential to understand how best to reduce the risk of goose strikes. Avian radar provides tactical information for mitigation measures and strategic data on local patterns of goose migration and habitat use. In the face of expanding air traffic, goose distributions and populations, these threats need to be integrated with other local, national and international stakeholder involvement to secure viable solutions to multiple conflicts.

Wild geese wintering in western Europe were declining by the 1930s probably due to loss of natural habitat and over exploitation through hunting, although the causes will never be known. Refuge provision and hunting restrictions from the 1950s enabled numbers to recover. Improved monitoring systems enabled the description of progressive increases and extensions of wintering range since that time, especially amongst those goose populations that increasingly exploited agricultural landscapes. This introductory article sets the scene for the special issue on the increasing interactions and conflicts created by recent increases in the range and abundance of wild geese throughout the northern hemisphere, especially with regard to agricultural damage, but including issues associated with air flight safety, human and animal health, ecosystem effects and conflicts with other biodiversity objectives. It also provides the context for finding common solutions to problems, presenting experiences from regional-, national- and flyway-coordinated management to find solutions to conflict.

Allometric constraints associated with digesting leaves require relatively small avian herbivores to consume high-quality forage. How such constraints are overcome during ontogeny when energy and nutrient requirements are relatively high has not been adequately explored. We compared growth trajectories of Canada and lesser snow goose goslings raised on grass-based diets that differed in protein (10%, 14% or 18%) and fibre (30% or 45%) with those of free-living goslings on Akimiski Island, Canada. This common-garden experiment allowed us to test the hypotheses that (i) smaller-bodied geese are more negatively affected by reduced forage quality than larger-bodied geese, and (ii) goslings from subarctic brood-rearing areas have a limited capacity to slow growth in response to reduced forage quality. Canada goose goslings fed low-protein (10%) diets were on average 44% lighter in body mass, had slower growth rates and were delayed >20 days in reaching 90% of asymptotic size compared with Canada goose goslings fed 18% protein. In contrast, snow goose goslings were unable to survive on the low-protein diets, and those fed high- or medium-protein diets grew at a similar rate and achieved similar asymptotic size. Canada and snow goose goslings fed low-protein diets had reduced growth rates of the tarsus and delayed emergence of the 9th primary. Free-ranging Canada goslings on Akimiski Island were similar in mass and structural size to captive-reared goslings fed low-protein diets. In contrast, snow goslings were similar in mass and structural size to the captive-reared goslings fed the high- and medium-protein diets. This suggests that degraded habitats with mostly low-protein forage may be able to support Canada goslings better than snow goslings which require higher-quality forage to survive. Size-related differences in gosling growth and survival in response to diminished diet quality may influence population size when available food reaches a lower threshold in protein content. However, goslings can avoid such density-dependent population regulation if they are able to move their broods and find adequate quality and quantity of forage.

Canada geese are increasingly abundant in Ohio, with large nesting populations throughout the state, and goose feces contaminate grassy areas and pavements in many public, commercial, and residential sites. In 1999 the authors found a high prevalence of Giardia, Campylobacter, and especially Cryptosporidium in collected feces of Canada geese. The purpose of this follow-up study was to survey known Canada geese sites in three counties in Ohio (Lucas, Ottawa, and Wood) and to determine the prevalence of sites testing positive for Cryptosporidium. The sites included golf courses, cemeteries, public parks, and health care and teaching facilities. At each of 11 sites, 12 goose feces of wet and loose appearance were collected and manually compressed into one composite sample representing that site. The samples were tested for Cryptosporidium with a sensitive monoclonal enzyme immunoassay (EIA) method. In 2000 and 2001, nine of 11 sites (81.8 percent) and nine of 10 sites (90 percent), respectively, were positive for Cryptosporidium. The species or genotypes of Cryptosporidium found in the geese feces and their potential to infect humans is unknown. A survey of the literature indicates, however, that while C. parvum (human genotype) is the main cause of cryptosporidiosis in humans, C. parvum (zoonotic genotypes), C. meleagridis (bird genotype), and C. felis (cat genotype) have occasionally been isolated from infected people. Further research is required to define the public health importance of Cryptosporidium in feces of Canada geese and other bird species.

As goose populations increase in abundance, their influence on ecological processes is increasing. We review the evidence for key ecological functions of wild goose populations in Eurasia and North America, including aquatic invertebrate and plant propagule transport, nutrient deposition in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, the influence of goose populations on vegetation biomass, carbon storage and methane emission, species diversity and disease transmission. To estimate the implications of their growing abundance for humans, we explore how these functions contribute to the provision of ecosystem services and disservices. We assess the weight, extent and trends among such impacts, as well as the balance of their value to society. We examine key unresolved issues to enable a more balanced assessment of the economic costs or benefits of migratory geese along their flyways, including the spatial and temporal variation in services and their contrasting value to different user groups. Many ecological functions of geese are concluded to provide neither services nor disservices and, ecosystem disservices currently appear to outweigh services, although this varies between regions. We consider an improved quantification of ecosystem services and disservices, and how these vary along population flyways with respect to variation in valuing certain cultural services, and under different management scenarios aimed at reducing their disservices, essential for a more balanced management of goose populations.

MicroRNA-122 (miR-122), a completely conserved, liver-specific miRNA in vertebrates, is essential for the maintenance of liver homeostasis. This 22-nucleotide-length RNA regulates diverse functions such as cholesterol, glucose, and lipid metabolism as well as iron homeostasis and infection of hepatitis C virus (HCV). Landes goose, which has a good, fatty liver, has important significance for us in studying miR-122 function in goose fatty liver. In the current study, we identified miR-122 in goose liver and its expression pattern and target genes. We found that miR-122 was highly expressed in goose liver and its expression was down-regulated after overfeeding; some genes related to lipid metabolism, including prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit alpha 1 (P4HA1); aldolase, fructose-bisphosphate B (ALDOB); and pyruvate kinase, muscle (PKM2), were predicted and validated as target genes of goose miR-122. After overexpression or inhibition of miR-122 in primary goose hepatocytes, the expression of ALDOB and PKM2 was changed, but not that of P4HA1, indicating miR-122 regulates ALDOB and PKM2 expression at the mRNA level. These findings suggest miR-122 play important roles in goose fatty liver by targeting some of the genes related to lipid metabolism.

Between the early 1900s and the 1990s, the greater snow goose Anser caerulescens atlanticus population grew from 3000 individuals to more than 700 000. Because of concerns about Arctic degradation of natural habitats through overgrazing, a working group recommended the stabilization of the population. Declared overabundant in 1998, special management actions were then implemented in Canada and the United States. Meanwhile, a cost-benefit socioeconomic analysis was performed to set a target population size. Discussions aiming towards attaining a common vision were undertaken with stakeholders at multiple levels. The implemented measures have had varying success; but population size has been generally stable since 1999. To be effective and meet social acceptance, management actions must have a scientific basis, result from a consensus among stakeholders, and include an efficient monitoring programme. In this paper, historical changes in population size and management decisions along with past and current challenges encountered are discussed.

This study evaluated the growth performance and meat characteristics of grower geese whose diets included garlic scape meal (GSM), a by-product of garlic production. Scape is the leaf-less flower stem of garlic. Garlic scape (GS) extracts contained 84.7 ± 3.8 μg/g dry weight (DW), 81.4 ± 8.2 μg/g DW, 0.78 ± 0.05 mg gallic acid equivalent/g DW and 31.67 ± 2.25 μg/g DW of allicin, alliin, total phenolics and flavonoid contents, respectively. In total, 120 White Roman geese aged 5 weeks were randomly distributed among 12 pens and fed on a grower diet ad libitum during the growth period. Employing a completely random design, 5 males and 5 females were placed in each pen. Each treatment was applied to three pens (in total 30 birds) and the treatments comprised the following: 1) control (maize-soybean meal), 2) 5% of maize replaced with 5% of GSM (5% GSM), 3) 10% of maize replaced with 10% of GSM (10% GSM) and 4) 15% of maize replaced with 15% of GSM (15% GSM). Each group of 30 birds was treated for 8 weeks. The results revealed that the 15% GSM group was characterised by a lower feed conversion ratio than the control group; however, these groups did not differ significantly in their body weights (BWs). In addition, the 10% GSM group did not differ in both the feed conversion ratio and consumption. The flavour intensity score of meats in the 10% GSM group was significantly lower than those of meats in the 5% GSM and control groups. The general acceptability scores of meats in the 5% GSM and control groups were higher than those of meat in the 10% GSM group. The study concluded that 5% dietary GSM in the feed did not adversely affect the growth performance, meat characteristics or sensory evaluation of grower geese. Hence, the environment can be protected by including agricultural waste in goose diets.

To explore the relationship among the level of fiber, gut microbiota, and nutritional substances, we applied the next generation sequencing technology for the identification of the composition and structure of microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract. In this study, a total of 25 phyla and 298 genera were identified from the gastrointestinal tract; Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria were the predominant phyla. The ability of cecum in carbohydrate metabolism was significantly higher than that of the gizzard and ileum (P < 0.05). The bacterial community structure in various stages of the development of the cecum was different. In the different growth stages of cecum, the increase in the microbiota structure of the fiber level elevates the ability of carbon hydration. Second, the apparent metabolic rates of the other nutrients were affected by the fiber and period except for acid detergent fiber (P < 0.05); the apparent utilization rate of the nutrients increased with time. However, with the increase in the fiber level, the apparent utilization of nutrients was initially increased, followed by a decrease. Therefore, a correlation was established between the fiber level and gastrointestinal microbiota and apparent nutrient utilization rate of the 3 phyla. Our results suggest that the fiber level and growth stages could impact the composition of gut microbiota.

Geese are capable of digesting and making use of a high-fiber diet, but the mechanism is not well understood and would be of great significance for the development and utilization of roughage resources. In this study, we investigated the effect of dietary fiber (source: corn stover and alfalfa, included at 5% or 8%) on microflora in goose intestines. We used 35-day-old Carlos geese in which we first studied the influence of fiber ingestion on diet digestibility and immune organ indices of geese and found that high dietary fiber (8% content) significantly increased feed intake, the digestibility of neutral and acid detergent fiber, and thymus, bursa, and spleen size. Subsequently, we investigated the effect of dietary fiber on the microbial flora in the various intestinal segments by high throughput sequencing. The bacterial diversity and relative abundance were significantly affected by the type and amount of dietary fiber fed, including that of cellulolytic bacteria such as Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, Clostridium, and Pseudomonas spp. Finally, we isolated and identified 8 strains with cellulolytic ability from goose intestine and then analyzed their activities in combination. The optimal combination for cellulase activity was Cerea bacillus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This study has laid a theoretical and practical foundation for knowledge of the efficient conversion and utilization of cellulose by geese.

In this study, volume density of white matter and grey matter areas of cervical segment of spinal cord in adult geese weighing 3-4 kg was examined using stereological methods. 10 geese were used as material without sex discrimination. All animals underwent perfusion with 10% buffered formaldehyde. Following the perfusion, animals were kept in 10% formaldehyde for 1 week. Geese were then dissected. Cervical area of spinal cord was revealed removing cervical spine. Tissue samples were obtained from each segment of cervical area. 5 μm thick cross-sections were taken from these tissue samples via microtome. Series of cross-sections were obtained by sampling in the ratio of 1/250 including 12 cross-sections from each cervical segment of every animal. Cross-sections were stained by haematoxylin eosin. They were photographed under microscope. Volume density (volume fractions) of both whole tissue and white matter and grey matter parts in each cervical segment of spinal cord were calculated using Cavalieri's Principle. In the study, total volume of cervical segment, volume of white matter and grey matter, and ratios of these volumes one another were assessed in goose.

The effects of dietary fiber sources on the meat quality, oxidative stability, and blood parameters of growing Graylag geese (28-112d) were investigated. The birds were randomly allocated into 4 treatments, of which dietary fiber was mainly from corn straw silage (CSS), steam-exploded corn straw (SECS), steam-exploded wheat straw (SEWS), and steam-exploded rice straw (SERS). No influence (P>0.05) on the basic chemical components, oxidative stability, or organoleptic traits of muscle were observed, except that birds fed SECS had a higher (P<0.05) protein proportion than those fed CSS or SERS, and CSS increased (P<0.01) the cholesterol content when compared to SEWS or SERS. Regarding fatty acid profile in meat, CSS and SECS increased (P<0.01) the proportion of C18:2n6t and decreased that of C21:0 and C22:0 when compared to the others. The birds fed SERS had a higher (P<0.05) proportion of C20:0 and C22:0 than the others, a higher proportion of C20:5n3, n-3 fatty acids, Δ-9 desaturase (18) index compared to those fed CSS or SECS, and a lower (P<0.01) proportion of C20:1n9 than those fed SECS or SEWS. Additionally, SEWS resulted in a higher (P<0.01) proportion of C20:2 when compared to the others. In conclusion, these fibers affect just the protein proportion, cholesterol content, and fatty acid profile of breast muscle, along with the concentration of TG and MDA in blood, but not the other characteristics. No superior fiber source exists with respect to meat quality, suggesting that Graylag geese feeding should make the most economically of the convenient fiber source with appropriate pretreatment.

Due to low doses of infection, an efficient and sensitive virus detection method is necessary to detect low amounts of goose hemorrhagic polyomavirus (GHPV). In this study, we have developed a TaqMan real-time PCR (qPCR) specific assay for the detection of GHPV. Specificity assay showed no cross-reactions with other common waterfowl viruses. The standard curve had a linear correlation of 0.997 and efficiency of 99% between the cycle threshold value and the logarithm of the plasmids copy number. The possible lowest detectable concentration was 35.4 copies/μl; 100 times more sensitive than conventional PCR (detection limit, 3.54 × 103 copies/μl). Domestic Jinyun Sheldrakes ducks and their embryonated eggs were found positive of GHPV infection which provides evidence of possible vertical transmission of GHPV.

This study was conducted by two trials to investigate effects of sequential feeding with low- and high-protein diets on growth traits and plasma metabolites in geese. In Trial I, the effect of sequential feeding under time-restricted feeding system was investigated. Seventy-two White Roman goslings were randomly allotted into either sequential feeding (S1) or control feeding (C1) group. All goslings were fed for 1 h at morning and at evening, respectively, from 2 to 8 weeks of age. S1 group was offered 13% CP diet at morning and 19% CP diet at evening. C1 group was offered the same diet (16% CP; mixed equally with the two diets mentioned above) at both morning and evening. Blood samples were hourly collected for 4 h after feeding at both morning and evening for the determination of the postprandial plasma levels of glucose, triacylglycerol and uric acid at the end of experiment. Results showed that BW, average daily gain (ADG), and daily feed intake (FI) were not different between groups, but the feed efficiency (FE) in S1 group was significantly higher than that in C1 group (P<0.05). The areas under curve (AUC) of plasma postprandial levels of glucose, triacylglycerol and uric acid were not affected by treatment, but the AUC of triacylglycerol and uric acid in morning were lower than those in evening (P<0.05). In Trial II, the effect of sequential feeding under ad libitum feeding system was investigated. Twenty-four goslings were randomly allotted into either sequential feeding (S2) or control feeding (C2) group. Diets were altered at 0600 and 1800 h, respectively, and geese were fed ad libitum from 4 to 8 weeks of age. S2 group was offered 14% CP diet at morning and 20% CP diet at evening. C2 group was supplied the same diet (mixed with the two diets according to the ratio of diets consumed by S2 group on the preceded day) at both morning and evening. Results showed that the ADG in S2 group was higher than those in C2 group (P<0.05). Summarized data from both trials showed that sequential feeding improves daily gain and FE in growing geese.

Most birds develop brood patches before incubation; epidermis and dermis in the brood patch region thicken, and the dermal connective tissue becomes increasingly vascularized and infiltrated by leukocytes. However, current dogma states that waterfowl incubate without modifications of skin within the brood patch region. The incubation periods of lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens; hereafter called snow geese) and Ross's geese (C. rossii) are 2-6 days shorter than those of other goose species; only females incubate. Thus, we hypothesized that such short incubation periods would require fully developed brood patches for sufficient heat transfer from incubating parents to eggs. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing the skin histology of abdominal regions of snow and Ross's geese collected at Karrak Lake, Nunavut, Canada. For female snow geese, we found that epidermis and dermis had thickened and vascularization of dermis was 14 times greater, on average, than that observed in males (n=5 pairs). Our results for Ross's geese (n=5 pairs) were more variable, wherein only one of five female Ross's geese fully developed a brood patch. Our results are consistent with three hypotheses about brood patch development and its relationship with different energetic cost-benefit relationships, resulting from differences in embryonic development and body size.

Normal tables provide an objective step-wise description of the morphological development of an embryo. Such tables have been described for the chicken, turkey, quail, and duck embryos, but there is no such staging table for goose embryos. As the goose has one of the longest incubation periods of all the poultry species and embryo mortality during incubation is relatively high, a normal table of goose embryo development would be useful in assessing the morpho-genetic status of the goose embryo before and during incubation. In this study, embryos were isolated from commercial White Koluda goose eggs stored no longer than four days in a cool room (18°C) prior to incubation and after 4, 8, 12, and 16 h of incubation. Embryo staging was based on the normal tables described for the chicken by Eyal-Giladi and Kochav (EGK) and Hamburger and Hamilton (HH). Goose embryos from unincubated eggs were at Stage X and XI EGK and after 16 h of incubation the majority of embryos were between Stages 2 and 4 HH. Our results suggest that while the stage of development of the embryo in the unincubated goose egg is similar to that reported for the chicken, although the diameter of goose embryo is slighter larger. Following incubation, a goose embryo advances more slowly than a chicken embryo up to 16 h of incubation.

Annotated genomes can provide new perspectives on the biology of species. We present the first de novo whole genome sequencing for the pink-footed goose. In order to obtain a high-quality de novo assembly the strategy used was to combine one short insert paired-end library with two mate-pair libraries. The pink-footed goose genome was assembled de novo using three different assemblers and an assembly evaluation was subsequently performed in order to choose the best assembler. For our data, ALLPATHS-LG performed the best, since the assembly produced covers most of the genome, while introducing the fewest errors. A total of 26,134 genes were annotated, with bird species accounting for virtually all BLAST hits. We also estimated the substitution rate in the pink-footed goose, which can be of use in future demographic studies, by using a comparative approach with the genome of the chicken, the mallard and the swan goose. A substitution rate of 1.38×10-7 per nucleotide per generation was obtained when comparing the genomes of the two closely-related goose species (the pink-footed and the swan goose). Altogether, we provide a valuable tool for future genomic studies aiming at particular genes and regions of the pink-footed goose genome as well as other bird species.

During the adaptive evolution of a particular trait, some selectively fixed mutations may be directly causative and others may be purely compensatory. The relative contribution of these two classes of mutation to adaptive phenotypic evolution depends on the form and prevalence of mutational pleiotropy. To investigate the nature of adaptive substitutions and their pleiotropic effects, we used a protein engineering approach to characterize the molecular basis of hemoglobin (Hb) adaptation in the high-flying bar-headed goose (Anser indicus), a hypoxia-tolerant species renowned for its trans-Himalayan migratory flights. To test the effects of observed substitutions on evolutionarily relevant genetic backgrounds, we synthesized all possible genotypic intermediates in the line of descent connecting the wildtype bar-headed goose genotype with the most recent common ancestor of bar-headed goose and its lowland relatives. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments revealed one major-effect mutation that significantly increased Hb-O2 affinity on all possible genetic backgrounds. Two other mutations exhibited smaller average effect sizes and less additivity across backgrounds. One of the latter mutations produced a concomitant increase in the autoxidation rate, a deleterious side-effect that was fully compensated by a second-site mutation at a spatially proximal residue. The experiments revealed three key insights: (i) subtle, localized structural changes can produce large functional effects; (ii) relative effect sizes of function-altering mutations may depend on the sequential order in which they occur; and (iii) compensation of deleterious pleiotropic effects may play an important role in the adaptive evolution of protein function.

The objective of the work was to investigate the effect of modified atmosphere (MA) packaging (high oxygen modified atmosphere and vacuum) on pH, water holding capacity and cooking loss of raw goose meat, and on the sensory assessment and shear force of roasted meat. Samples refrigerated at 1°C were tested within 24 h after slaughter (unpacked meat) and on d 4, 7, 11, and 14 of storage (modified atmosphere or vacuum packed meat).The type of atmosphere used in packaging determined the functional properties of goose meat such as: pH, WHC, cooking loss and shear force. This is important from both the culinary and technological viewpoint. At the end of storage the meat packed in MA (consisting of 80% O2, 20%CO2) had higher cooking loss, lower pH values, and water holding capacity in comparison to samples stored in vacuum. The type of atmosphere influenced the sensory descriptors (characteristic odor and flavor, tenderness, juiciness and general evaluation) of roasted meat. Samples packed in MA did worse during sensory assessment with respect to odor and flavor, tenderness, juiciness and general assessment. Thus meat stored under modified atmosphere showed lower productivity and was less tender and juicy.The goose breast muscles packed in vacuum proved to be better suited for consumption and processing as compared to those packed in high oxygen MA.

A new supplementary lighting program was designed to increase the egg production of geese under natural light conditions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the supplementary lighting program on egg production of White Roman geese in an open housing system at the Tropic of Cancer. Forty mature White Roman geese were randomly allocated into two groups (male:female=1:4). The supplementary lighting program with a total daily photoperiod of between 12.0 h and 13.5 h was initiated on 1 November and withdrawn from the experimental group on 30 January. In contrast, the geese in the control group were kept under natural lighting conditions throughout this study. The results showed that the laying peak of the experimental group occurred earlier than normal in the reproductive season and the geese continued laying throughout the breeding season. The geese in the experimental group had 47.6 eggs/goose which was significantly (P<0.05) more than that of the control group having 26.4 eggs/goose. We can conclude that the supplemental lighting method will result in an earlier laying peak of the geese in the breeding season and higher egg production. The supplementary lighting program was able to maximize egg production in geese at the Tropic of Cancer.

A flapping flight mechanism of the Canada goose (Branta canadensis) was estimated using a two-jointed arm model in unsteady aerodynamic performance to examine how much energy can be saved in migration. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to evaluate airflow fields around the wing and in the wake. From the distributions of velocity and pressure on the wing, it was found that about 15% of goose flight energy could be saved by drag reduction from changing the morphology of the wing. From the airflow field in the wake, it was found that a pair of three-dimensional spiral flapping advantage vortices (FAV) was alternately generated. We quantitatively deduced that the optimal depth (the distance along the flight path between birds) was around 4m from the wing tip of a goose ahead, and optimal wing tip spacing (WTS, the distance between wing tips of adjacent birds perpendicular to the flight path) ranged between 0 and -0.40m in the spanwise section. It was found that a goose behind can save about 16% of its energy by induced power from FAV in V-formation. The phase difference of flapping between the goose ahead and behind was estimated at around 90.7° to take full aerodynamic benefit caused by FAV.

The goose is one of the most important waterfowl, having lowing laying rate. Previous studies have shown the SNPs in the introns of MAGI-1 (Record-106975) and ACSF2 (Record-106582) significantly associated with egg production in geese. However, the mechanism of those SNPs influencing egg production remains unclear. In this study, the three goose breeds (Yangzhou geese, Zhedong white geese, and Carlos geese) with obviously different egg production were selected, and the allele frequency distribution and functions of those SNPs were investigated. The results suggested that the allele frequency distribution of ACSF2 was significantly different among the three goose breeds (χc2 = 92.377, Pc = 2.29 × 10-22), with the C allele appearing at frequencies of 0.29 in the Yangzhou geese and 0.94 in the Carlos geese. In contrast, the allele frequencies of MAGI-1 were not significantly different among the different goose breeds. Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that the expression of MAGI-1 with the AG genotype individuals was significantly higher than those of the AA and GG genotype. For ACSF2, the CC genotype had significantly higher expression than both the AC genotype and the AA genotype. The luciferase reporter analysis revealed that the site-directed mutation ACSF2 (A>C) significantly drove the expression activity. Further analysis suggested that the mutation altered the binding site of the transcription factor BARHL2. Binding of BARHL2 to the ACSF2 intron was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) analysis. Thus, our findings revealed the A>C mutation of ACSF2 (Record-106582) could promote the expression by regulating the binding of BARHL2, resulting in differences in egg performance, which provided molecular insights into the effect of the polymorphism in ACSF2 on egg performance in geese.

A novel calicivirus (strain H146) was detected in a goose and sequenced. The H146 genome consisted of two open reading frames (ORFs) with an 8-nucleotide (nt) overlap between the two ORFs, similar to what has been found in the bat sapovirus TLC58. The virus was most closely related to nacoviruses when comparing the complete genome sequence (49% identity), non-structural region (NS; 31-34% amino acid [aa] sequence identity), and major structural VP1 region (28-30% aa identity), whereas both goose calicivirus N and feline calicivirus were the closest relatives of H146 in the VP2 region (20% aa sequence identity). The levels of divergence between H146 and its closest relatives in different genomic regions are comparable to those between some members of different genera. Phylogenetic analysis based on the NS and VP1 amino acid sequences clearly demonstrated that H146 formed a separate clade. Thus, calicivirus H146 was identified as a founding member of a novel genus for which we propose the name "Sanovirus".

The effects of climate on wild populations are often channelled through species interactions. Population responses to climate variation can therefore differ across habitats, owing to variation in the biotic community. Theory predicts that consumer demography should be less variable and less responsive to climate in habitats with greater resource diversity. We tested these predictions using a long-term study of breeding lesser snow geese along the western coast of Hudson Bay, Manitoba, Canada. Reproductive success was measured in 22 years from 114 locations, in either coastal or inland habitat types. We used Bayesian analysis to estimate the response of reproductive success to climate in each habitat type, along with residual variation not explained by climate. We then quantified gosling diet composition in each habitat type to test the prediction that reproductive success would be less variable and more responsive to climate in habitats with lower resource diversity. Reproductive success responded positively to seasonal warmness, but this response was much stronger in inland habitats than in coastal habitats. Site- and year-level random effects were also three to five times more variable in inland habitats. Simultaneously, land cover diversity and gosling diet diversity were lower in inland habitats. Our study illustrates that spatial variation in resource diversity (and thus, species interactions) can have important effects on consumer responses to climate. In this system, climate change is expected to disproportionately increase the reproductive success of snow geese in vast inland habitats, potentially counteracting management efforts to reduce the abundance of this keystone herbivore.

Genomic DNA from four strains of geese was analyzed for the presence of endogenous viral elements using a probe that can detect over 20 Rous-associated endogenous viral genes (ev genes) in chickens, as well as a probe and protocol that detects endogenous avian viruses (EAV). Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA did not reveal any ev genes in DNA of 15 geese from Chinese, Synthetic, or two Embden goose strains. Even under low stringency conditions, using a probe that covered most of the polymerase (pol) gene of the Rous-associated virus (RAV) and that revealed EAV elements in a chicken without ev genes, no viral loci were evident in goose DNA.

1. The aim of the study was to estimate the heritability of the laying performance in the cumulative and partial production of eggs and predict the breeding values of native Zatorska geese in a conservation programme using Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) methodology. Second, the trajectory of the egg production curve was examined. 2. The data contain information about the laying performance of 1831 individuals in the first year of laying. To describe the trajectory of the laying performance, 10 mathematical models were tested. For the genetic parameter estimation of egg production, data from 1038 birds were used with a production higher than 20 eggs during the first season of laying. 3. The analysis of egg production was based on single and multi-trait models. Heritability, genetic and phenotypic correlations between phases of the laying performance as well as breeding values were estimated. 4. The best adaptation to the goose egg laying curve was the Ali and Schaeffer model. The estimates of heritability were 0.20 (0.06 SE) using the single-trait model and ranged from 0.12 to 0.24 using the multi-trait model. 5. The results suggest that the BLUP method can support the conservation programme.

Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) play a crucial role in the field of regenerative medicine and tissue repair for its own unique features. However, up to date, the isolation and characterizations of multidifferentiation potentials of goose ADSCs are still uncertain. In this study, we successfully isolated ADSCs from goose inguinal groove in vitro for the first time and also attempted to unravel its fundamental differentiation potentials and genetic characteristics. The results showed that isolated ADSCs exhibited a typical fibroblast-like morphology and high proliferative potential, could be passaged for at least 40 passages and maintained high hereditary stability with more than 92.2% of cells were diploid (2n = 78) by G-banding analysis. Moreover, the ADSCs could express pluripotent marker gene (OCT4) and mesenchymal stem cells-related surface antigens, which are similar to previously reported human ADSCs. Additionally, the goose ADSCs could be induced to transdifferentiate into cells of three layers in vitro, such as osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes derived from mesoderm, neurocytes from ectoderm, and hepatocytes of the endoderm. Most of all, we confirmed that the induced β-like cells and hepatocytes had metabolic functions similar to normal cells in vivo. Taken together, these results demonstrated the multidifferentiation potentials of ADSCs in vitro, which conferred an appealing candidate for cell regenerative therapy.

The bar-headed goose is currently one of the most popular species for rare birds breeding in China. However, bar-headed geese in captivity display a reduced reproductive rate. The gut microbiome has been shown to influence host factors such as nutrient and energy metabolism, immune homeostasis and reproduction. It is therefore of great scientific and agriculture value to analyze the microbial communities associated with bar-headed geese in order to improve their reproductive rate. Here we describe the first comparative study of the gut microbial communities of bar-headed geese in three different breeding pattern groups by 16SrRNA sequences using the Illumina MiSeq platform. The results showed that Firmicutes predominated (58.33%) among wild bar-headed geese followed by Proteobacteria (30.67%), Actinobacteria (7.33%) and Bacteroidetes (3.33%). In semi-artificial breeding group, Firmicutes was also the most abundant bacteria (62.00%), followed by Bacteroidetes (28.67%), Proteobacteria (4.20%), Actinobacteria (3.27%) and Fusobacteria (1.51%). The microbial communities of artificial breeding group were dominated by Firmicutes (60.67%), Fusobacteria (29.67%) and Proteobacteria (9.33%). Wild bar-headed geese had a significant higher relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, while semi-artificial breeding bar-headed geese had significantly more Bacteroidetes. The semi-artificial breeding group had the highest microbial community diversity and richness, followed by wild group, and then the artificial breeding group. The marked differences of genus level group-specific microbes create a baseline for future bar-headed goose microbiology research.

Ambient temperature and air pressure are relevant stimuli that can elicit hormonal responses in alignment with adjusting individuals' physiology and behaviour. This study investigated possible changes in corticosterone (C) and testosterone (T) and contingencies with behaviour in response to ambient temperature and air pressure, and it evaluated the temporal response dynamics of these hormones in 12 individual Greylag geese (Anser anser) over 26 and 12 individual Northern bald ibis (Geronticus eremita) over 27 days, during late winter. Immunoreactive metabolites of C and T were analysed non-invasively from 626 fecal samples by means of group-specific antibodies and correlated to behaviour and weather factors. In both species, high C levels correlated with low temperatures 24h before sampling, but low C levels correlated with high air pressure 6-12h before sampling. In both species, C levels and behavioural activity were negatively correlated. In addition, temperature had a positive influence on T levels in both species 12-24h before sampling. The fact that weather conditions influenced changes in levels of C, while social interactions did not, is indicative of a general mechanism of graduated physiological adjustment to environmental variations affecting metabolism, stress responses and behaviour.

The structure and composition of the eggshells of two commercial species (guinea fowl and greylag goose) have been studied. Thin sections and scanning electron microcopy show the similarity of the overall structure, but the relative thickness of the layers differs in these two taxa. Atomic force microscopy shows that the different layers are composed of rounded, heterogeneous granules, the diameter of which is between 50 and 100 nm, with a thin cortex. Infrared data and thermogravimetric analyses show that both eggshells are made of calcite, but differing on the quality and quantity when the organic component is considered. Chemical maps show that chemical element distribution is not uniform within a sample, and differs between the species, but with low magnesium content. Electron back scattered diffraction confirms the eggshells are calcite, but the microtexture strongly differs between the two species. Based on the chemical-structural differences, a species-specific biological control on the biomineralization is found, despite the rapid formation of an eggshell. Overall results indicate that to estimate the quality of eggshells, such as resistance to breakage, is not a straightforward process because of the high complexity of avian eggshell biomineralization.

Embryo development and chick quality are influenced by parental genotype, age, nutrition, environment, and flock management. The aim of study was to determine if genotype, age of goose or eggs laid near the onset of egg production vs. eggs laid near the end of reproduction influence the stage of embryo at oviposition. Three experiments were undertaken. To compare genotypes (Experiment 1) 150 eggs were collected from 3-year-old commercial line White Koluda (WK) geese and from two breeds involved in a genetic resources conservation program, Zatorska (Za) and Bilgoraj (Bi). Age comparison (Experiment 2) was conducted with 200 eggs collected from 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-year-old WK geese. To compare laying periods (Experiment 3), 150 WK eggs were collected at the first week of March and 100 at the second half of June. Eggs were stored for 72 h at 16°C, staged using Eyal-Giladi and Kochav (EGK, Roman numerals) and Hamburger and Hamilton (HH, Arabic numerals) procedures. Experiment 1: Individual breed differences were evident with Stage X EGK embryos comprising 42.4, 33.3, and 38.7% in the eggs examined from the WK, Bi, and Za, respectively. For all breeds combined, 38.8% of the embryos were in Stage X, but in the next order in WK there was stage XI (18.2%), while in geese from the genetic reserve it was stage XIII (Bi - 33.3; Za - 29.0%). Experiment 2: In eggs of 1-, 2-, and 3-year-old WK geese, the majority of embryos (38.7, 32.4 and 42.2%, respectively) were in Stage X. In contrast, in 4-year-old geese the embryos were in Stage XI (36.1%). Experiment 3: In eggs collected in March and in June most of embryos were in Stage X (33.7% and 43.6%, respectively). In addition, more developmentally advanced stages (XI-XIII) were similar in both periods. However, embryos in Stage 2 HH were only observed in eggs collected at the end of laying season. Interestingly, earlier stages (VI-IX) were observed exclusively in the eggs collected in March.

In 2012, the four countries hosting the Svalbard population of pink-footed goose Anser brachyrhynchus along its flyway launched an International Species Management Plan for the population. One of the aims was to reduce conflicts between geese and agriculture to an acceptable level. Since 2006, Norway has offered subsidies to farmers that provide refuge areas for geese on their land. We evaluate the mid-Norwegian goose management subsidy scheme, with a view to its adjustment to prevailing ecological and socio-economic parameters. The analysis indicates that the legitimacy of the scheme is highly dependent on transparency of knowledge management and accountability of management scheme to the farming community. Among farmers, as well as front-line officials, outcomes of prioritisation processes within the scheme are judged unfair when there is an evident mismatch between payments and genuine damage. We suggest how the scheme can be made more fair and responsive to ecological changes, within a framework of adaptive management.

Meat tenderization can be affected by a variety of factors including animal age. However, results obtained from goose, chicken, turkey, and ostrich studies have shown that the effects of age on meat tenderization were insignificant, which may be due to a very limited age difference in birds used in those studies. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of animal age on postmortem proteolysis and tenderization of breast muscle from developing and mature White Roman geese. Goose carcasses from mature (50 mo old, n = 10) and young (3 mo old, n = 10) geese were vacuum-packaged and stored at 5°C within 10 min postmortem. Breast (pectoralis major) samples were taken at 0 (∼10 min postmortem), 1, 3, and 7 D of storage. Our results showed that the decrease in pH, calpain-1 and -11 activities, desmin content and shear force, as well as the increase in myofibrillar fragmentation index were more rapid (P < 0.05) in young than in mature goose breast. These results suggest that postmortem proteolysis and tenderization of goose muscle are extensively affected by age.

A 2-year-old Pomeranian goose ( Anser anser) weighing 8.1 kg was examined because of non-weight-bearing lameness of the right limb. A closed, transverse, diaphyseal fracture of the distal third of the right tibiotarsus with a craniolateral displacement of the distal fragment was diagnosed radiographically. Surgery under general anesthesia was performed to repair the fracture with a 14-hole, 2.7-mm locking plate fixed with 6 screws in a bicortical manner. Two days later, the bird was fully weight-bearing on the leg. Radiographs performed 4 and 8 weeks after surgery showed good healing of the affected bone with an appropriate callus formation bridging the fracture line. Sixteen weeks after surgery, the patient was readmitted because of lameness exhibited while staying outside exposed to subzero (°C) temperatures. On the basis of this finding, heat conduction was postulated as the possible cause of lameness because it disappeared after implant removal. To the best our knowledge, this case represents the first report of a surgical repair of a tibiotarsal fracture with a locking plate in waterfowl.

High altitude flight in rarefied, extremely cold and hypoxic air is a very challenging activity. Only a few species of birds can achieve it. Hitherto, the structure of the lungs of such birds has not been studied. This is because of the rarity of such species and the challenges of preparing well-fixed lung tissue. Here, it was posited that in addition to the now proven physiological adaptations, high altitude flying birds will also have acquired pulmonary structural adaptations that enable them to obtain the large amounts of oxygen (O2) needed for flight at high elevation, an environment where O2 levels are very low. The Andean goose (Chloephaga melanoptera) normally resides at altitudes above 3000 meters and flies to elevations as high as 6000 meters where O2 becomes limiting. In this study, its lung was morphologically- and morphometrically investigated. It was found that structurally the lungs are exceptionally specialized for gas exchange. Atypically, the infundibulae are well-vascularized. The mass-specific volume of the lung (42.8 cm3.kg-1), the mass-specific respiratory surface area of the blood-gas (tissue) barrier (96.5 cm2.g-1) and the mass-specific volume of the pulmonary capillary blood (7.44 cm3.kg-1) were some of the highest values so far reported in birds. The pulmonary structural specializations have generated a mass-specific total (overall) pulmonary morphometric diffusing capacity of the lung for oxygen (DLo2) of 0.119 mlO2.sec-1.mbar-1.kg-1, a value that is among some of the highest ones in birds that have been studied. The adaptations of the lung of the Andean goose possibly produce the high O2 conductance needed to live and fly at high altitude.

The local geese in the transition region between the Caucasus Mountains and Anatolia have economically significant differences in productivity and are identified by four feather colors, white, black, piebald, and yellow. This study was undertaken to determine the genetic structure, evolutionary relationships, and genetic diversity among these birds. DNA samples were obtained from 100 animals, and 50 random primers were screened. Genetic relationships were determined by random amplified polymorphic DNA polymorphisms obtained from a total of 48 loci, showing 40 bands (83.33%) that were polymorphic among all the populations investigated. A dendrogram constructed for this study revealed a close relationship between the white and the black birds. Additionally, the piebald birds showed close similarity to white and black geese, and the yellow birds displayed a clear distance from the other three populations.

It has generally been assumed, based on morphology, that Chinese domestic goose breeds were derived from the swan goose (Anser cygnoides) and that European and American breeds were derived from the graylag goose (Anser anser). To test the validity of this assumption, we investigated the mtDNA cleavage patterns of 16 Chinese breeds and 2 European breeds as well as hybrids produced between a Chinese breed and a European breed. After 224 mtDNAs, isolated from the Chinese and European breeds, were digested by 19 restriction endonucleases, variations of the cleavage patterns were observed for four enzymes (EcoRV, HaeII, HincII, and KpnI). All Chinese breeds and their maternal hybrids except the Yili breed showed an identical haplotype, named haplotype I or the Chinese haplotype; the European breeds and the Yili breed showed another haplotype, named haplotype II or the western haplotype. None of the haplotype found in the Chinese type was detectable in the western type and vice versa. The two haplotypes were found to differ from each other at 8.0% of the sites surveyed and with a 0.72% sequence divergence. Using 2% substitution per million years calibrated from the genera Anser and Branta, the two domestic geese haplotypes were estimated to have diverged approximately 360,000 years ago, well outside the 3000-6000 years in domestic history. Our findings provide the first molecular genetic evidence to support the dual origin assumption of domestic geese in the world. Meanwhile, the four mtDNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms can be used as maternal genetic markers to distinguish the two types of domestic geese.

We have studied the binding of inositol pentaphosphate (IPP) to the hemoglobins from two species of goose living at low and high altitudes, using the proton absorption method. Measurements were done at 25 and 37 degrees C in a pH range between 6.0 and 8.8. The bird hemoglobins show a high affinity and a binding stoichiometry of 1 IPP molecule/hemoglobin tetramer both in the ligated and unligated state, indicating the same binding site for IPP in oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin. The results indicate that the interaction of IPP with both geese hemoglobins is very similar. For the deoxyhemoglobins of both species the IPP-binding constant shows a strong pH dependence extending over a wide pH range (i.e. +/- 2 x 10(6) M at pH 8.8 and +/- 6 x 10(10) M at pH 6.0). The binding constant of IPP for the oxyhemoglobins shows a much weaker pH dependence (i.e. +/- 4 x 10(4) M at pH 8.8 and +/- 3 x 10(6) M at pH 6.0), indicating that the interaction of IPP with the goose hemoglobin is strongly dependent on the state of ligation of the protein. The IPP binding constants for the oxy- and deoxyhemoglobins are found to be in good agreement with the IPP-induced change in oxygen affinity of both hemoglobins as estimated from oxygen binding curves.

The hemisphere size has been studied in wild and domestic geese (Anser fabalis, n = 77: A. albifrons, n = 48; A. anser, n = 8; A. anser f. domestica, n = 10), which were classified according to particular age category (adult or immature). Material used in studies was fixed in 4% solution of formaldehyde. The brain weight as well as hemispheres' length, width and height was measured with standard method. Morphometric characteristic of geese's brains has been presented in absolute and relative way (by parallel use of index and allometric approach). The appropriate ontogenic, taxonomic and domestication comparisons were carried out. The greatest differences referred to absolute and relative width and height of hemispheres.

Swan goose (Anser cygnoides) is currently one of the most popular economic wildfowl for rare birds breeding industries in several provinces of China. However, the farmed Swan geese, reared in artificial environment and fed on both natural and artificial diets, display a reduced reproductive rate compared to wild species. Little is known about the gut microbiota of this species, which could play a role in nutrient and energy metabolism, immune homeostasis and reproduction. The present comparative study was designed to provide a first characterization of gut microbial communities related to both wild and farmed Swan geese by 16 S rRNA sequences using the Illumina HiSeq platform. The results showed that dominant microbial components in both groups consisted of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. The abundances of these four phyla were not statistically different between the groups. At the genus level, significantly decreased abundance of Clostridium and increased abundance of SMB53, Enterococcus and Paenibacillus were observed in farmed group compared to wild group. The marked differences of genus level group-specific microbes create a baseline for future Swan goose microbiology research and make a valuable contribution to forming relationships between gut microbiota and domestic bird reproduction.

Many goose species feed on agricultural land, and with growing goose numbers, conflicts with agriculture are increasing. One possible solution is to designate refuge areas where farmers are paid to leave geese undisturbed. Here, we present a generic modelling tool that can be used to designate the best locations for refuges and to gauge the area needed to accommodate the geese. With a species distribution model, locations are ranked according to goose suitability. The size of the area to be designated as refuge can be chosen by including more or less suitable locations. A resource depletion model is then used to estimate whether enough resources are available within the designated refuge to accommodate all geese, taking into account the dynamics of food resources, including depletion by geese. We illustrate this with the management scheme for pink-footed goose Anser brachyrhynchus implemented in Norway. Here, all geese can be accommodated, but damage levels appear to depend on weather, land use and refuge size.

De novo lipogenesis (DNL) is an important physiological mechanism, but it is poorly understood in avian follicles. The protein distribution patterns of three key genes related to DNL (i.e., FAS, ACC, and PPARγ) were firstly determined in geese developing follicles using immunohistochemistry, and our results showed that all three proteins were present in both prehierarchical and hierarchical follicles. Furthermore, it was revealed by qPCR that transcripts of these three genes were widely expressed in theca and granulosa layers of all staged follicles; however, the expression of DNL-related genes in granulosa cell changed significantly (P < 0.05) after follicle selection (FAS and PPARγ) and before ovulation (FAS). It is suggested that the DNL mechanism may be closely related to the follicular selection, while FAS may be closely associated with ovulation and steroidogenesis. These results suggested that DNL exists throughout follicle development and it potentially have an important role in the process of follicular selection, development, steroidogenesis, and ovulation, especially in their granulosa layers. To further demonstrate this point, granulosa cells isolated from hierarchical follicles were cultured in vitro. By analyzing the mRNA and protein expression patterns of these three genes, the fatty acid synthase enzyme activity, the contents of extracellular triglyceride, and intracellular lipids, as well as the cell activity at different time points of in vitro culture (0, 6, 12, and 18 h). These findings not only ensured the existence of DNL in the granulosa cells of goose follicles, but also suggested the complex process of lipid metabolism that associated with DNL, may play an important role in cell proliferation and physiological functions. Taken together, we first confirmed the existence of lipid metabolism, especially the DNL in goose follicles, and further suggested its role in the follicles, especially in the granulosa cells.

1. New lighting programmes were designed to change the pattern of goose reproduction, based on the response of predictable avian photoperiodic stimulation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of a long photoperiod of 20L on shifting goose reproduction to the non-breeding season in an open housing system. 2. Eighty mature White Roman geese were randomly allocated into 4 groups (male:female = 1:4). The supplemental lighting programmes with a daily photoperiod of 20 h were initiated on 22 November and withdrawn when 90% of geese were moulting in the treatment groups. Artificial light intensities of 220, 120 and 20 lux were provided to experimental groups A, B and C, respectively. In contrast, the geese in control group D were kept under natural lighting conditions throughout this study. 3. The annual reproductive curves of all the experimental groups consisted of two separate laying periods. The first period was induced by the supplemental lighting programme while the second was induced by the naturally increasing photoperiod in this subtropical region. The first laying period of the experimental groups occurred in the breeding season, and the second was relocated to the non-breeding season. 4. The supplemental lighting could shift the laying periods of geese to the non-breeding season and had no significant effect on annual reproductive performance. The supplemental light programmes described here were able to manipulate the reproductive season of geese reared in open houses, which would be of practical value.

Hybrids were produced between an African male and several Pilgrim female domestic geese. Partial karyotypes revealed a difference in the fourth largest pair of autosomal chromosomes. This chromosome pair was metacentric in the African, submetacentric in the Pilgrim, and heteromorphic in the hybrids. A similar difference between the putative wild ancestors of the African and Pilgrim breeds has been reported by others. These findings provide cytological evidence to support the traditional opinion that the African breed was derived from the Asiatic swan goose (Anser cygnoides) and the Pilgrim breed was derived from the European greylag goose (Anser anser).

Transmembrane protein 8C (Tmem8C) is a muscle-specific membrane protein that controls myoblast fusion, which is essential for the formation of multinucleated muscle fibres. As most of the birds can fly, they have enormous requirement for the muscle, but there are only a few studies of Tmem8C in birds. In this study, we obtained the coding sequence (CDS) of Tmem8C in goose, predicted miRNAs that can act on the 3'UTR, analysed expression profiles of this gene in breast and leg muscles (BM and LM) during the embryonic period and neonatal stages, and identified miRNAs that might affect the targeted gene. The results revealed a high homology between Tmem8C in goose and other animals (indicated by sequence comparisons and phylogenetic trees), some conservative characteristics (e.g., six transmembrane domains and two E-boxes in the 5'UTR might be the potential binding sites of muscle regulatory factors (MRFs)), and the dN/dS ratio indicated purifying selection acting on this gene, facilitating conservatism in vertebrates. Q-PCR indicated Tmem8C had a peak expression pattern, reaching its highest expression levels in stage E15 in LM and E19 in BM, and then dropping transiently in E23 (P < 0.05). We examined 13 candidate miRNAs, and negative relationships were detected both in BM and LM (mir-125b-5p, mir-15a, mir-16-1 and mir-n23). Notably, mir-16-1 significantly decreased luciferase activity in dual luciferase reporter gene (LRG) assay, suggesting that it can be identified as potential factors affecting Tmem8C. This study investigated Tmem8C in water bird for the first time, and provided useful information about this gene and its candidate miRNAs in goose.

1. Paired box (Pax7) gene is a member of the paired box family and plays a critical role in animal growth and muscle development. However, the molecular characterisation of the goose Pax7 gene is unknown. 2. The open-reading frame of goose Pax7 is composed of 1509 bp, which encodes a protein of 503 amino acids and shares high homology with Pax7 of other birds. 3. Ten single-nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in the genomic DNA sequence, 8 located in the intron region and two located in the exon region. 4. Association analysis showed the C122T locus was significantly associated with the body weight of Zhedong-White geese in week 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. 5. It was concluded that the goose Pax7 gene may be an important candidate gene for goose growth traits and marker-assisted selection.

The goose is an economically important waterfowl that exhibits unique characteristics and abilities, such as liver fat deposition and fibre digestion. Here, we report de novo whole-genome assemblies for the goose and swan goose and describe the evolutionary relationships among 7 bird species, including domestic and wild geese, which diverged approximately 3.4~6.3 million years ago (Mya). In contrast to chickens as a proximal species, the expanded and rapidly evolving genes found in the goose genome are mainly involved in metabolism, including energy, amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism. Further integrated analysis of the host genome and gut metagenome indicated that the most widely shared functional enrichment of genes occurs for functions such as glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, starch and sucrose metabolism, propanoate metabolism and the citrate cycle. We speculate that the unique physiological abilities of geese benefit from the adaptive evolution of the host genome and symbiotic interactions with gut microbes.

The bar-headed goose is famed for migratory flight at extreme altitude. To better understand the physiology underlying this remarkable behavior, we imprinted and trained geese, collecting the first cardiorespiratory measurements of bar-headed geese flying at simulated altitude in a wind tunnel. Metabolic rate during flight increased 16-fold from rest, supported by an increase in the estimated amount of O2 transported per heartbeat and a modest increase in heart rate. The geese appear to have ample cardiac reserves, as heart rate during hypoxic flights was not higher than in normoxic flights. We conclude that flight in hypoxia is largely achieved via the reduction in metabolic rate compared to normoxia. Arterial [Formula: see text] was maintained throughout flights. Mixed venous PO2 decreased during the initial portion of flights in hypoxia, indicative of increased tissue O2 extraction. We also discovered that mixed venous temperature decreased during flight, which may significantly increase oxygen loading to hemoglobin.

1. Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) is a common phenomenon in animals. Rensch's rule states that larger species generally exhibit a higher male to female body size ratio than smaller ones. 2. Domesticated animals offer excellent opportunities for testing predictions of the functional explanations of Rensch's rule and this was tested in a meta-analysis of SSD in 38 breeds of domestic geese compared among themselves and with their wild relatives (subfamily Anserinae, 35 species). 3. Domestic geese and wild Anser species taken together supported Rench's rule but the wild species did not. 4. The non-targeted sex selection hypothesis seems to provide the best intuitive explanation for the lack of SSD in geese.

The manner in which patterns of variation and interactions among demographic rates contribute to population growth rate (λ) is key to understanding how animal populations will respond to changing climatic conditions. Migratory species are likely to be particularly sensitive to climatic conditions as they experience a range of different environments throughout their annual cycle. However, few studies have provided fully integrated demographic analyses of migratory populations in response to changing climatic conditions. Here, we employed integrated population models to demonstrate that the environmental conditions experienced during a short but critical period play a central role in the demography of a long-distance migrant, the light-bellied Brent goose (Branta bernicla hrota). Female survival was positively associated with June North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) values, whereas male survival was not. In contrast, breeding productivity was negatively associated with June NAO, suggesting a trade-off between female survival and reproductive success. Both adult female and adult male survival showed low temporal variation, whereas there was high temporal variation in recruitment and breeding productivity. In addition, while annual population growth was positively correlated with annual breeding productivity, a sensitivity analysis revealed that population growth was most sensitive to changes in adult survival. Our results demonstrate that the environmental conditions experienced during a relatively short-time window at the start of the breeding season play a critical role in shaping the demography of a long-distant Arctic migrant. Crucially, different demographic rates responded in opposing directions to climatic variation, emphasising the need for integrated analysis of multiple demographic traits when understanding population dynamics.

Here we report the resting metabolic rate in barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) and provide evidence for the significant energetic effect of posture. Under laboratory conditions flow-through respirometry together with synchronous recording of behaviour enabled a calculation of how metabolic rate varies with posture. Our principal finding is that standing bipedally incurs a 25% increase in metabolic rate compared to birds sitting on the ground. In addition to the expected decrease in energy consumption of hindlimb postural muscles when sitting, we hypothesise that a change in breathing mechanics represents one potential mechanism for at least part of the observed difference in energetic cost. Due to the significant effect of posture, future studies of resting metabolic rates need to take into account and/or report differences in posture.

Previous studies on wild moulting waterfowl have demonstrated that flight and leg muscles experience periods of hypertrophy and atrophy. This is thought to be in response to the change in use of the locomotor muscles as described in the use/disuse hypothesis. We tested this hypothesis using captive barnacle geese. Forty geese were dissected before, during and after wing moult, to determine the changes in mass and functional capacity of the flight and leg muscles. Physiological cross sectional areas (PCSA) and mean fascicle lengths of functional muscle groups were calculated to ascertain the force-producing capabilities of the flight and leg muscles. At the onset of moult, flight muscle mass was at a minimum, having atrophied by 35% compared with pre-moult levels, but it returned to pre-moult levels by the end of wing moult. By contrast, the leg muscles hypertrophied during wing moult by 29%, and the PCSA of individual muscle groups increased substantially. Increases in mass, PCSA and fascicle length of individual leg muscle groups during moult suggest that, when flightless, the leg muscles are functionally adapted to provide greater force and/or manoeuvrability to the birds, to aid ground-based escape from predators. Through studying captive animals that are unable to fly, it has been possible to conclude that the major changes in leg and flight muscle in moulting captive geese cannot be explained through use or disuse. Instead, changes seem to be compensatory or to occur in anticipation of changes in locomotor patterns.

Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4 (SMAD4) is an important protein in animal reproduction. It plays pivotal roles in cellular pathways, including apoptosis. The expression profile of the SMAD4 gene in goose ovarian follicles has not been reported. In this study, the SMAD4 coding sequence was cloned from the Yangzhou goose. A phylogenetic analysis was performed and mRNA expression was examined in various tissues using quantitative real-time PCR. An alternative splice form of SMAD4, SMAD4-b having 1656 bp, was identified. SMAD4-a mRNA was widely expressed in various healthy tissues, whereas SMAD4-b was very weakly expressed. SMAD4 mRNA in the ovary and oviduct was significantly higher than that in the pituitary and hypothalamus. SMAD4 mRNA expression analysis in hierarchical follicles showed that the level of SMAD4 mRNA was higher in large white follicles and post-ovulatory follicles than in the other follicles. The results indicate that SMAD4 might be involved in the recruitment of hierarchical follicles.

The distribution of ganglion cells in the retina determines the specific regions of the visual field with high visual acuity, and thus reflects the perception of a species' visual environment. The terrain hypothesis proposes that animals living in open areas should have a horizontal visual streak across the retina with high ganglion cell density to increase visual acuity along the horizon. We tested this hypothesis in Canada geese (Branta canadensis) by assessing retinal topography, visual field configuration, and scanning behavior. We found that geese have an oblique rather than a horizontal visual streak across the retina: from a dorsal-nasal to a ventral-temporal position. Geese showed narrow blind areas, which increased the range of their lateral vision, and a relatively large degree of eye movement. Canada geese have relatively wide binocular fields and can see their bill tips. Goose head movement rates were low compared to species with a single fovea, and head movement rates increased in visually obstructed habitats. Canada geese have high acuity across their retina, which would allow them to simultaneously scan the ground and the sky when the head is up and parallel to the ground, as well as align the visual streak with the horizon when the head is tilted downwards. Their visual streak, along with their large eye size, may reduce the need for large amplitude head movements during vigilance bouts in visually unobstructed habitats. Overall, the visual system of geese combines features related to the detection of predators/conspecifics in open areas (visual streak, large lateral field, reduced head movements) as well as visual specializations that would allow for monitoring both the ground and sky (oblique streak) and for extracting and handling of food items (wide binocular fields, visualization of the bill tip).

The objective of the work was to investigate the color and lipid oxidation changes of goose breast meat packaged in vacuum and modified atmosphere (MA) conditions consisting of 80% O2, 20% CO2, and stored in refrigerated conditions at 4°C. Color stability was monitored by determining total heme pigments concentration; relative concentration of myoglobin, oxymyoglobin, and metmyoglobin; parameters of color L*, a*, b*, and sensory evaluation of the surface color. Lipid stability was measured by determining thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). The samples were examined in 24 h after slaughter (unpacked muscles) and on d 4, 7, 9, 11 of storage (muscles packed in vacuum and in MA). Through the time of storage, samples packed in MA had higher TBARS values in comparison to the meat packed in vacuum. For samples packed in two types of atmospheres, the total pigments concentration decreased gradually within 11 d of storage. It was observed that relative metmyoglobin concentration increased whereas relative oxymyoglobin concentration decreased in total heme pigments in the MA stored muscle. The relative concentration of all three myoglobin forms sample packed in vacuum remained unchanged. The color parameters (L*, a*, b*) did not change for 11 d of storage for the vacuum packed meat. The value of the color parameter a* decreased and the value of the color parameters L* and b* increased in the samples packaged in MA. The data prove that if you store goose meat in MA (consisting of 80% O2, 20% CO2) or vacuum, the unchanged surface color is preserved for 9 and 11 day, respectively.Vacuum appears to be a better method as regards the maintaining of lipid stability in goose meat.

Two hundred and eighty eight-d-old goslings were allocated at random to one of 18 groups, each group comprising 8 of each sex. Three starter and three grower diets (both 11, 12, 13 MJ AME/kg) were fed and were combined in a factorial design to give 9 treatments. The starter diets were given for 4 weeks and the grower diets from weeks 5 to 9 inclusive. Body weight was unaffected by treatment, but the males were significantly heavier than the females. Food intake declined significantly as the dietary energy concentration increased. The efficiency of food utilisation of birds fed on the starter diet with the lowest energy concentration was significantly less than that of birds fed on the other diets. Birds fed on the grower diet with the highest energy concentration gave significantly better FCE than those fed on the other diets. There was no evidence to suggest that the treatments had any significant effect on carcase components and chemical composition of the geese. Oleic acid was significantly depressed and linoleic acid concentration increased as the energy concentration of the diets increased. However, this may reflect the higher fat concentrations in the diets with the higher energy concentrations.

Three light sources: Cool-White (C), Vita-Lite (V), and tungsten (T), each at two intensities (20 or 50 lx), were used to supplement light to 16 hr in a 24-hr cycle for geese maintained in open-shed pens. Two lines of mixed breeds of geese, white and grey, were used and egg production was followed from the 27th week of age through 6 months of the laying period. A significant increase in egg production was found under the C light illumination. At 20 lx, egg production was significantly higher than at 50 lx. No difference in egg production was found between the two lines of geese; however, significant interactions were found between light sources, intensities, and geese lines, as exhibited by different patterns of egg production. Light intensity had the greatest effect until peak egg production had been reached; thereafter, egg production was influenced mainly by the light source.

Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) is a cell-surface receptor primarily expressed on macrophages. Here, two novel TREM genes, AcTREM1 and AcTREM2, were identified from Anas cygnoides. AcTREM1 cDNA contained a putative signal peptide, two IG domains, and a transmembrane domain. The deduced AcTREM2 sequence also contained a signal peptide, an IG domain, and a transmembrane domain. qRT-PCR, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and immunofluorescence experiments showed that AcTREM1 and AcTREM2 were mainly expressed in the liver and spleen, and both genes and proteins were mainly distributed in cytoplasm. AcTREM1 expression in the liver and spleen was significantly upregulated following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge at an early stage of infection and then decreased at a later stage. Changes in AcTREM2 expression were reciprocal to those of AcTREM1 in the liver and spleen after LPS challenge. Our results indicate that AcTREM1 and AcTREM2 participate in the antibacterial immunity of A. cygnoides.

The epithelium of the ventral surface of the apex of the tongue in most birds is specified by the presence of the special superficial layer called lingual nail. The aim of the present study is to determine the localization of the alpha-keratin and beta-keratin (corneous beta protein) in this special epithelium in the domestic goose by using immunohistochemistry staining and the Raman spectroscopy analysis. Due to lack of commercially available antibodies to detect beta-keratin (corneous beta protein), the Raman spectroscopy was used as a specific tool to detect and describe the secondary structure of proteins. The immunohistochemical (IHC) detections reveal the presence of alpha-keratin in all layers of the epithelium, but significant differences in the distribution of the alpha-keratin in the epithelial layers appear. The staining reaction is stronger from the basal layer to the upper zone of the intermediate layer. The unique result is weak staining for the alpha-keratin in the lingual nail. Applications of the Raman spectroscopy as a complementary method not only confirmed results of IHC staining for alpha-keratin, but showed that this technique could be used to demonstrate the presence of beta-keratin (corneous beta protein). Functionally, the localization of alpha-keratin in the epithelium of the ventral surface of the lingual apex provides a proper scaffold for epithelial cells and promotes structural integrity, whereas the presence of beta-keratin (corneous beta protein) in the lingual nail, described also as exoskeleton of the ventral surface of the apex, endures mechanical stress.

Black sparrowhawks (Accipiter melanoleucus) recently colonised the Cape Peninsula, South Africa, where the species faces competition for their nest sites from Egyptian geese (Alopochen aegyptiaca) which frequently usurp black sparrowhawk nests. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that multiple nest building by black sparrowhawks is a strategy to cope with this competitor, based on a 14-year long term data set.

Invasive and overabundant species are an increasing threat to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning world-wide. As such, large amounts of money are spent each year on attempts to control them. These efforts can, however, be thwarted if exploitation is compensated demographically or if populations simply become too numerous for management to elicit an effective and rapid functional response. We examined the influence of these mechanisms on cause-specific mortality in lesser snow geese using multistate capture-reencounter methods. The abundance and destructive foraging behaviours of snow geese have created a trophic cascade that reduces (sub-) Arctic plant, insect and avian biodiversity, bestowing them the status of 'overabundant'. Historically, juvenile snow geese suffered from density-related degradation of their saltmarsh brood-rearing habitat. This allowed harvest mortality to be partially compensated by non-harvest mortality (process correlation between mortality sources: ρ = -0.47; 90% BCI: -0.72 to -0.04). Snow goose family groups eventually responded to their own degradation of habitat by dispersing to non-degraded areas. This relaxed the pressure of density dependence on juvenile birds, but without this mechanism for compensation, harvest began to have an additive effect on overall mortality (ρ = 0.60; 90% BCI: -0.06 to 0.81). In adults, harvest had an additive effect on overall mortality throughout the 42-year study (ρ = 0.24; 90% BCI: -0.59 to 0.67). With the aim of controlling overabundant snow geese, the Conservation Order amendment to the International Migratory Bird Treaty was implemented in February of 1999 to allow for harvest regulations that had not been allowed since the early 1900s (e.g. a spring harvest season, high or unlimited bag limits and use of electronic calls and unplugged shotguns). Although harvest mortality momentarily increased following these actions, the increasing abundance of snow geese has since induced a state of satiation in harvest that has driven harvest rates below the long-term average. More aggressive actions will thus be needed to halt the growth and spread of the devastating trophic cascade that snow geese have triggered. Our approach to investigating the impacts of population control efforts on cause-specific mortality will help guide more effective management of invasive and overabundant species world-wide.

Purpose suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS-1) is inducible feedback inhibitors of cytokine signaling and involved in viral infection through regulation of both innate and adaptive immunity. In this study, we firstly cloned SOCS-1 (goSOCS-1) from duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV) infected goose. The full-length sequence of goSOCS-1 ORF is 624bp and encoded 108 amino acids. Structurally, the mainly functional regions (KIR, SH2, SOCS-box) were conserved between avian and mammalian. The tissues distribution data showed SOCS-1 highly expressed in immune related tissues (SP, LU, HG) of both gosling and adult goose. Moreover, the goSOCS-1 transcripts were induced by goIFNs in GEFs and by TLR ligands in PBMCs. Notably, upon DTMUV infection, highly expression level of goSOCS-1 was detected in vitro and in vivo with high viral load. Our results indicated that goSOCS-1 might involve in both innate and adaptive antiviral immunity of waterfowl.

An International Species Management Plan for the Svalbard population of the pink-footed goose was adopted under the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds in 2012, the first case of adaptive management of a migratory waterbird population in Europe. An international working group (including statutory agencies, NGO representatives and experts) agreed on objectives and actions to maintain the population in favourable conservation status, while accounting for biodiversity, economic and recreational interests. Agreements include setting a population target to reduce agricultural conflicts and avoid tundra degradation, and using hunting in some range states to maintain stable population size. As part of the adaptive management procedures, adjustment to harvest is made annually subject to population status. This has required streamlining of monitoring and assessment activities. Three years after implementation, indicators suggest the attainment of management results. Dialogue, consensus-building and engagement among stakeholders represent the major process achievements.

We tested the hypotheses that the relationship between heart rate (fH) and the rate of oxygen consumption ((O(2))) differs between walking and flying in geese and that fH and (O(2)) have a U-shaped relationship with flight speed. We trained barnacle geese Branta leucopsis (mean mass 2.1 kg) and bar-headed geese Anser indicus (mean mass 2.6 kg) to walk inside a respirometer on a treadmill and to fly in a wind tunnel with a respirometry mask at a range of speeds. We measured fH and (O(2)) simultaneously during walking on the treadmill in five individuals of each species and in one bar-headed goose and four barnacle geese during flight in the wind tunnel. The relationships between fH and (O(2)) were significantly different between flying and walking. (O(2)) was higher, and the increment in (O(2)) for a given increase in fH was greater, for flying than for walking geese. The relationship between fH and (O(2)) of free-living barnacle geese during their natural migratory flights must differ from that measured in the wind tunnel, since the fH of wild migratory birds corresponds to values of (O(2)) that are unrealistically low when using the calibration relationship for our captive birds. Neither fH nor (O(2)) varied with flight velocity across the range of speeds over which the geese would fly sustainably.

Three types of mechanical papillae, i.e., conical, filiform, and hair-like papillae, are present on the tongue in the domestic goose. Within conical papillae, we distinguish three categories: large and small conical papillae on the body and conical papillae on the lingual prominence. The arrangement of mechanical papillae on the tongue in Anseriformes is connected functionally with different feeding mechanisms such as grazing and filter-feeding. The present work aims to determine whether morphology of three types of mechanical papillae in goose at the time of hatching is the same as in an adult bird and if the tongue is prepared to fulfill feeding function. Our results revealed that the primordia of the large conical papillae start to develop during the differentiation stage. The primordia of the small conical papillae and conical papillae of the lingual papillae start to develop during the growth stage. At the end of the growth stage, only large conical papillae, three pairs of small conical papillae, and conical papillae of the lingual prominence have similar arrangement as in an adult bird. The shape and arrangement of the remaining small conical papillae probably will be changed after hatching. During embryonic period, the filiform papillae and hair-like papillae are not formed. The embryonic epithelium that covered the mechanical papillae undergoes transformation leading to the formation of multilayered epithelium. During prehatching stage, epithelium becomes orthokeratinized epithelium. In conclusion, the tongue of the domestic goose after hatching is well prepared only for grazing. The filtration of food from water is limited due to the lack of filiform papillae.

1. Global change may strongly affect population dynamics, but mechanisms remain elusive. Several Arctic goose species have increased considerably during the last decades. Climate, and land-use changes outside the breeding area have been invoked as causes but have not been tested. We analysed the relationships between conditions on wintering and migration staging areas, and survival in Svalbard pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus. Using mark-recapture data from 14 winters (1989-2002) we estimated survival rates and tested for time trends, and effects of climate, goose density and land-use. 2. Resighting rates differed for males and females, were higher for birds recorded during the previous winter and changed smoothly over time. Survival rates did not differ between sexes, varied over time with a nonsignificant negative trend, and were higher for the first interval after marking (0.88-0.97) than afterwards (0.74-0.93). Average survival estimates were 0.967 (SE 0.026) for the first and 0.861 (SE 0.023) for all later survival intervals. 3. We combined 16 winter and spring climate covariates into two principal components axes. F1 was related to warm/wet winters and an early spring on the Norwegian staging areas and F2 to dry/cold winters. We expected that F1 would be positively related to survival and F2 negatively. F1 explained 23% of survival variation (F1,10=3.24; one-sided P=0.051) when alone in a model and 28% (F1,9=4.50; one-sided P=0.031) in a model that assumed a trend for survival. In contrast, neither F2 nor density, land-use, or scaring practices on important Norwegian spring staging areas had discernible effects on survival. 4. Climate change may thus affect goose population dynamics, with warmer winters and earlier springs enhancing survival and fecundity. A possible mechanism is increased food availability on Danish wintering and Norwegian staging areas. As geese are among the main herbivores in Arctic ecosystems, climate change, by increasing goose populations, may have important indirect effects on Arctic vegetation. Our study also highlights the importance of events outside the breeding area for the population dynamics of migrant species.

The aim of this work was to study the effects of spontaneous hyperphagia on the evolution of intestinal microbiota and body compartments in old goose. From October 25th to November 26th, 5-yr-old breeding Greylag Landaise geese (106 males and 106 females) were fed with grass during 1 mo (G period). From November 26th (0 d) the birds had ad libitum access to pellets (AMEn: 10.5 MJ/kg, CP: 18.9 g/kg; spontaneous fattening (SF) period). Some birds were killed at -31 d (n = 24; 50/50 sex ratio), 0 d (n = 48), 14 (n = 46), 22 d (n = 46), and 70 d (n = 48) after the start of G period to measure body traits. For microbial analysis, 10 of the samples per sex at 0 d, 14 d, and 70 d were selected to be representative of body traits. Between 0 and 22 d, liver weight increased from 98 g to 194 g in males and from 89 g to 199 g in females (P < 0.001). Liver weight decreased between 22 and 70 d from 194 to 174 g in males and from 199 to 163 g in females (P < 0.001). Irrespective of the diet (G or SF period) and the sex of the bird, the two major phyla were Proteobacteria (49%) and Firmicutes (48%). Bacteroidetes represented around 3.0% of the sequences. At order level, Firmicutes were dominated by Clostridiales (33% of total sequences) and Lactobacillales (13% of total sequences) and Proteobacteria were dominated by Campylobacteriales (34% of total sequences). Finally, Bacteroidetes were dominated by Bacteroidales. SF and sex did not change the microbial diversity but sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis allowed us to highlight discriminant operational taxonomic unit between experimental groups. In conclusion, our result showed that changes in the body compartments of old geese during spontaneous hyperphagia depend on the sex of the birds, but not so much in gut microbial composition. Further investigations are necessary to understand the functional microbiota and highlight the role of gut microbiota in hepatic steatosis induced with hyperphagia in geese.

The aim of this study was to characterize the embryonic ontogeny of 5-hydroxyindoles and 5-methoxyindoles synthesis pathways in the goose pineal organ. The study was performed on embryos aged 14-28 days, which have been incubated under a 12L:12D cycle. The pineal organs were collected for measurements of indole content by HPLC every 6 h on embryonic day (ED) 14, ED 16, ED 18 and ED 22 or every 2 h on ED 24, ED 26 and ED 28. The level of tryptophan showed no significant changes during development and no day-night variations. The content of 5-hydroxytryptophan increased between ED 14 and ED 26. It was significantly higher during scotophase than during photophase starting from ED 14. The serotonin content was low during the early stages of development (ED 14-ED 18) and prominently increased from ED 20. The serotonin levels also showed day-night differences; however, they were less conspicuous than those of 5-hydroxytryptophan. The changes in the level of 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid were similar to those of serotonin. 5-Hydroxytryptophol was measurable from ED 18. Levels of N-acetylserotonin, which were detectable for the first time on ED 16, prominently increased between ED 22 and ED 28 and showed significant day-night differences from ED 20. Melatonin was detectable from ED 18. Like N-acetylserotonin, its content increased rapidly between ED 22 and ED 28, and from ED 20 showed diurnal variations. 5-Methoxyindole acetic acid and 5-methoxytryptophol occurred at measurable levels from ED 18 and ED 26, respectively. The obtained results showed that embryonic development of indole metabolism in the goose pineal organ starts with the beginning of serotonin synthesis. The processes of serotonin acetylation and 5-hydroxyindoles methylation were turned on later. Diurnal rhythmicity develops very early in the embryonic pineal organ of the goose when the eggs are incubated under a 12 h light: 12 h dark schedule. Two processes are responsible for generation of the diurnal rhythms of 5-hydroxyindoles and 5-methoxyindoles: (i) hydroxylation of tryptophan and (ii) acetylation of serotonin.

Ten adult blue-winged teal (Anas discors) and six Canada goose (Branta canadensis) goslings were inoculated with liver tissue from a natural case of duck plague in a wild mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). Four additional teal were placed in contact with the inoculated ducks. Inoculated teal died 63.5-68 hr after inoculation; two of the contact teal died 161-162 hr after exposure. Three of the goslings died 119-133 hr after inoculation, the others were killed when moribund 90-133 hr postinfection. The clinical course of disease was extremely rapid in both species. Signs were limited to sudden onset of profound weakness, ataxia, tremors and terminal convulsions. The only consistent gross lesion in the teal was a small dark spleen; half the teal also had inconspicuous foci of epithelial necrosis in the distal esophagus and in the cloaca. Goslings had more severe lesions, with focal hepatic necrosis visible in all, and mucosal necrosis over the intestinal lymphoid tissue, and intestinal hemorrhage in three birds each. Microscopic lesions in both species were similar to those reported in mallards. Duck plague might be overlooked at necropsy of blue-winged teal, because of the paucity of gross lesions.

We investigated how population changes and fluctuations in the pink-footed goose might have been affected by climatic and anthropogenic factors. First, genomic data confirmed the existence of two separate populations: western (Iceland) and eastern (Svalbard/Denmark). Second, demographic inference suggests that the species survived the last glacial period as a single ancestral population with a low population size (100-1,000 individuals) that split into the current populations at the end of the last glacial maximum with Iceland being the most plausible glacial refuge. While population changes during the last glaciation were clearly environmental, we hypothesize that more recent demographic changes are human-related: (1) the inferred population increase in the Neolithic is due to deforestation to establish new lands for agriculture, increasing available habitat for pink-footed geese, (2) the decline inferred during the Middle Ages is due to human persecution, and (3) improved protection explains the increasing demographic trends during the 20th century. Our results suggest both environmental (during glacial cycles) and anthropogenic effects (more recent) can be a threat to species survival.

2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase-like (OASL) is a kind of antiviral protein induced by interferons (IFNs), which plays an important role in the IFNs-mediated antiviral signaling pathway. In this study, we cloned and identified OASL in the Chinese goose for the first time. Goose 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase-like (goOASL), including an ORF of 1527bp, encoding a protein of 508 amino acids. GoOASL protein contains 3 conserved motifs: nucleotidyltransferase (NTase) domain, 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) domain, and 2 ubiquitin-like (UBL) repeats. The tissue distribution profile of goOASL in 2-week-old gosling and adult goose were identified by Real-Time quantitative PCR, which revealed that the highest level of goOASL mRNA transcription was detected in the blood of adult goose and gosling. The mRNA transcription level of goOASL was upregulated in all tested tissues of duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV)-infected 3-day-old goslings, compared with control groups. Furthermore, using the stimulus Poly(I: C), ODN2006, R848, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as well as the viral pathogens DTMUV, H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV), and gosling plague virus (GPV) to treat goose peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for 6 h, goOASL transcripts level was significantly upregulated in all treated groups. To further investigate the antiviral activity of goOASL, pcDNA3.1(+)-goOASL-His plasmid was constructed, and goOASL was expressed by the goose embryo fibroblast cells (GEFs) transfected with pcDNA3.1(+)-goOASL-His. Our research data suggested that Newcastle disease virus (NDV) replication (viral copies and viral titer) in GEFs was significantly reduced by the overexpression of goOASL protein. These data were meaningful for the antiviral immunity research of goose and shed light on the future prevention of NDV in fowl.

1. How climatic changes affect migratory birds remains difficult to predict because birds use multiple sites in a highly interdependent manner. A better understanding of how conditions along the flyway affect migration and ultimately fitness is of paramount interest. 2. Therefore, we developed a stochastic dynamic model to generate spatially and temporally explicit predictions of stop-over site use. For each site, we varied energy expenditure, onset of spring, intake rate and day-to-day stochasticity independently. We parameterized the model for the migration of pink-footed goose Anser brachyrhynchus from its wintering grounds in Western Europe to its breeding grounds on Arctic Svalbard. 3. Model results suggested that the birds follow a risk-averse strategy by avoiding sites with comparatively high energy expenditure or stochasticity levels in favour of sites with highly predictable food supply and low expenditure. Furthermore, the onset of spring on the stop-over sites had the most pronounced effect on staging times while intake rates had surprisingly little effect. 4. Subsequently, using empirical data, we tested whether observed changes in the onset of spring along the flyway explain the observed changes in migration schedules of pink-footed geese from 1990 to 2004. Model predictions generally agreed well with empirically observed migration patterns, with geese leaving the wintering grounds earlier while considerably extending their staging times in Norway.

Spontaneous liver steatosis can be experimentally induced in domestic Greylag geese by combining a short photoperiod with a sequence of feed restriction followed by ad libitum corn feeding. This could offer an alternative to the conventional "foie gras" production system based on overfeeding. The present work aimed at comparing the compositional characteristics, sensory profile, and acceptability by a consumer panel of fatty livers obtained by overfeeding and spontaneous fattening. In all, 210 male geese were used: 125 geese were raised over a 31-wk period to produce fatty liver without overfeeding ("alternative livers") and 85 were raised using conventional methods with overfeeding ("conventional livers"). Mean liver weight was over 1 kg (1,102 g) in the conventional group and 445 g in the alternative group. The characteristics of the livers were studied in 2 subpopulations: 44 conventional livers representative of the experimental population (mean liver weight 1,064 g) and 42 alternative livers weighing more than 400 g (mean 702 g). Compared with the alternative livers, livers from the conventional group showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher dry matter and lipid contents, lighter color (L*), and lower yellowness (b*). The neutral lipids of alternative livers contained significantly less triglycerides and free fatty acids and significantly more cholesterol and cholesterol esters than those from conventional livers. Detailed analysis of the fatty acid composition of triglycerides showed that the proportion of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids was significantly higher in the alternative livers. However, covariance analysis suggested that these differences in lipid composition were mainly due to differences in lipid content between both types of livers. The evaluation of cooked livers by a trained expert panel revealed significant differences in the sensory profile between the conventional and alternative livers. The acceptability by a consumer panel was significantly lower in alternative compared to conventional livers. This difference was not related to weight and/or lipid content since livers of similar weight range (800 to 1,000 g) were compared and showed clear-cut differences for hedonic scores.

The effects of induced hypothalamic hyperphagia and forced-feeding were studied in 30 geese of the Landes breed. They were housed in individual cages under a dark-light cycle of 12 hrs light-12 hrs darkness. Eleven geese with ventromedian hypothalamic (VMH) lesions and 8 controls were fed ad libitum. A third lot of 11 force-fed animals was pair-fed with the operated geese. The study lasted 4 weeks after an adaptation period to the new environmental conditions. The daily food intake of the geese and their weekly liveweight gain were monitored. After VMH lesions, the mean food intake of the geese increased by 169 p. 100 so that after each treatment their liveweight increased and they became obese (P less than 0.001). The tissue distribution of the group with lesions showed a higher amount of subcutaneous fat (P less than 0.05), while the mesenteric fat (P less than 0.05) was more abundant after forced-feeding. The liver weight was much higher in all cases; its increment reached 311 p. 100 in geese with VMH lesions and 193 p. 100 in the force-fed. However, those values were too low when compared to the means obtained by traditional forced-feeding. Hyperphagia in the geese was very marked as compared to that in rats, but it was insufficient to produce a considerable hepatic steatosis.

In highly seasonal environments, timing of breeding of organisms is typically set to coincide with the period of highest resource availability. However, breeding phenology may not change at a rate sufficient to keep up with rapid changes in the environment in the wake of climate change. The lack of synchrony between the phenology of consumers and that of their resources can lead to a phenomenon called trophic mismatch, which may have important consequences on the reproductive success of herbivores. We analyzed long-term data (1991-2010) on climate, plant phenology and the reproduction of a long-distance Arctic migrant, the greater snow goose (Chen caerulescens atlantica), in order to examine the effects of mismatched reproduction on the growth of young. We found that geese are only partially able to adjust their breeding phenology to compensate for annual changes in the timing of high-quality food plants, leading to mismatches of up to 20 days between the two. The peak of nitrogen concentration in plants, an index of their nutritive quality for goslings, occurred earlier in warm springs with an early snow melt. Likewise, mismatch between hatch dates of young and date of peak nitrogen was more important in years with early snow melt. Gosling body mass and structural size at fledging was reduced when trophic mismatch was high, particularly when the difference between date of peak nitrogen concentration and hatching was >9 days. Our results support the hypothesis that trophic mismatch can negatively affect the fitness of Arctic herbivores and that this is likely to be exacerbated by rising global temperatures.

In this study, we undertook the first complete the Swan Goose (Anser cygnoides L.) mitochondrial genome. The total length of the mitogenome is 16,739 bp. It contains the typical structure, including 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, and one D-loop region. The overall composition of the mitogenome is A (29.2%), G (15.8%), C (32.8%), and T (22.2%). Besides, the base preference of AT was not determined. Twenty-two kinds of tRNA were all typically cloverleaf structures. According to the phylogenetic analysis, A. cygnoides L. has a closer relationship with Anser anser.

The aim of this trial was to study the influence of feed form on the performance, gizzard development and carcass traits of growing geese. Between 42 and 98 days of age, 360 geese (type Maxipalm(®)) were fed a diet containing 500 g sorghum/kg (nitrogen-corrected apparent metabolizable energy 12.6 MJ/kg, 15.1 g/kg CP). Birds were divided into three groups differing in feed form: complete pellets (Control group, n = 120); a coarse-ground meal (CG group, n = 120); or a mixture containing protein-rich pellets and sorghum whole grains (M group, n = 120). Feed intake per pen (40 birds/pen) was measured weekly between 42 and 98 days of age, and individual live weight (LW) was measured every 2 weeks. At 84 and 98 days of age, 12 birds were slaughtered in each group to measure the gizzard development and body traits. Irrespective of the goose sex, LW at 98 days was lower for the CG group than for the Control group (5555 v. 5888 g, P < 0.05 for males and 5039 v. 5215 g, P < 0.05 for females). The feed intake over the entire period was 5.5% higher in the M group (P < 0.05) than in the Control and CG groups but the feed conversion ratio (6.91, P > 0.05) was similar in the three groups. The gizzard development (as % of LW) was higher in birds of the CG group than those of the Control and M groups at 84 days of age (+13.98% and +13.51%, respectively; P < 0.05) but was similar in all three groups at 98 days of age (4.01%, P > 0.05). The relative liver development was lower in the birds of the CG group than those of the other two groups at 84 and 98 days of age (-20%, P < 0.001 and -10%, P < 0.05, respectively). The other body traits were similar in the three groups at both 84 and 98 days of age. The present results suggest that a simplified diet presented in the form of a mixture of sorghum whole grains and protein-rich pellets did not reduce the performance of growing geese.

Dongting Lake is the second largest freshwater lake in China and is one of the globally important wintering sites for migratory waterbirds in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. Crucial sites and environmental variables for wintering migratory waterbirds are of great concern in the Dongting Lake wetlands. In this research, based on annual (2003/2004-2016/2017) waterbird and habitat census data, we recognized the crucial sites for waterbirds during wintering seasons by comparing the difference of waterbird populations at the community, foraging guild and species levels in different natural wetlands within East Dongting Lake, and then identified the crucial environmental variables affecting waterbird distributions by analyzing the relationship between waterbird populations and the environmental variables, including vegetation area, mudflat area, water area with the depth of 0-20 cm, water area with the depth of 20-50 cm, water area with the depth of 50-100 cm, water area with the depth >100 cm, growth status of vegetation (Min, Mean and Max NDVI), and the human disturbance. Results indicated that five natural wetlands, i.e., Daxiaoxi, Chunfeng, Baihu lakes, Dingzi dyke and Tanjiaweizi, were recognized as the crucial wintering sites for migratory waterbirds in the East Dongting Lake. Among the ten selected environmental variables, water areas with the depth of 0-20 cm, 20-50 cm and >100 cm, human disturbance, Min and Mean NDVIs were identified as the crucial environmental variables overall. Waterbirds at different levels exhibited significant linear relationship with certain environmental variables, with the exception of Bean goose and Lesser White-fronted goose at the species level, which showed Gaussian distribution with changes in mean NDVI. The crucial environmental variables appeared to be foraging guild- and species-specific. These findings provide significant information for managers to understand the differences of wetlands and waterbird populations within East Dongting Lake, and to make more targeted conservation efforts.

We cloned the goose heat shock protein 70 gene (HSP70), to determine its sequence variation and elucidate its mRNA expression. We designed primers to amplify the entire goose HSP70 sequence. We used 10 commercial Wuzong goslings in a heat-stress experiment. We collected tissue samples for RNA extraction and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). We analyzed the variation in expression of goose HSP70 before and after heat stress. We constructed a DNA pool from six different species, for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) screening. We detected 18 SNPs and selected three of these SNPs for correlation analysis with biological and immune traits in 200 Wuzong geese. We showed that T+237C was significantly correlated with the serum corticosterone level, whereas T+1122C was significantly correlated with the heterophil to lymphocyte ratio. Goose HSP70 contained no introns. The results of qRT-PCR analysis revealed significant gender differences in the expression of goose HSP70 at 40°C but not at 25°C; moreover, in general, expression was significantly higher at 40°C than at 25°C. With the exception of the leg muscle and cerebellum, HSP70 expression was significantly higher in male geese than in female geese. Our results indicate that goose HSP70 plays an important role in response to severe heat stress.

A full understanding of population dynamics depends not only on estimation of mechanistic contributions of recruitment and survival, but also knowledge about the ecological processes that drive each of these vital rates. The process of recruitment in particular may be protracted over several years, and can depend on numerous ecological complexities until sexually mature adulthood is attained. We addressed long-term declines (23 breeding seasons, 1992-2014) in the per capita production of young by both Ross's Geese (Chen rossii) and Lesser Snow Geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) nesting at Karrak Lake in Canada's central Arctic. During this period, there was a contemporaneous increase from 0.4 to 1.1 million adults nesting at this colony. We evaluated whether (1) density-dependent nutritional deficiencies of pre-breeding females or (2) phenological mismatch between peak gosling hatch and peak forage quality, inferred from NDVI on the brood-rearing areas, may have been behind decadal declines in the per capita production of goslings. We found that, in years when pre-breeding females arrived to the nesting grounds with diminished nutrient reserves, the proportional composition of young during brood-rearing was reduced for both species. Furthermore, increased mismatch between peak gosling hatch and peak forage quality contributed additively to further declines in gosling production, in addition to declines caused by delayed nesting with associated subsequent negative effects on clutch size and nest success. The degree of mismatch increased over the course of our study because of advanced vegetation phenology without a corresponding advance in Goose nesting phenology. Vegetation phenology was significantly earlier in years with warm surface air temperatures measured in spring (i.e., 25 May-30 June). We suggest that both increased phenological mismatch and reduced nutritional condition of arriving females were behind declines in population-level recruitment, leading to the recent attenuation in population growth of Snow Geese.

In group-living species, decisions made by individuals may result in collective behaviours. A central question in understanding collective behaviours is how individual variation in phenotype affects collective behaviours. However, how the personality of individuals affects collective decisions in groups remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of boldness on the decision-making process in different-sized groups of barnacle geese. Naive barnacle geese, differing in boldness score, were introduced in a labyrinth in groups with either one or three informed demonstrators. The demonstrators possessed information about the route through the labyrinth. In pairs, the probability of choosing a route prior to the informed demonstrator increased with increasing boldness score: bolder individuals decided more often for themselves where to go compared with shyer individuals, whereas shyer individuals waited more often for the demonstrators to decide and followed this information. In groups of four individuals, however, there was no effect of boldness on decision-making, suggesting that individual differences were less important with increasing group size. Our experimental results show that personality is important in collective decisions in pairs of barnacle geese, and suggest that bolder individuals have a greater influence over the outcome of decisions in groups.

The features of antioxidant protection of tissues of a liver and blood of the gooses in embriogenesis and early postnatal ontogenesis are found out. Maximal contents TBA active products both in a liver, and in a blood are observed in 28 diurnal embriones. Is shown, that in a liver the activity of basic antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutases, catalase and glutathione peroxidase) in a liver is developed already at early stages embriogenesis and is considerably enlarged in the end embriogenesis. The becoming of enzymatic system of a blood descends much more slower.

Dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) gene, a member of the dopamine receptors gene family, has been studied as a candidate gene for broodiness due to its special effects on avian prolactin secretion. Here, the genomic DNA and cDNA sequences of goose (Anser cygnoides) DRD2 gene were cloned and characterized for the first time. The goose DRD2 cDNA is 1353bp in length and encodes a protein of 450 amino acids. The length of goose DRD2 genomic DNA is 8350bp, including seven exons and six introns. We identified four goose DRD2 variants, which were generated due to alternative splicing. Bioinformatics analysis indicates that all the deduced DRD2 amino acid sequences contain seven putative transmembrane domains and four potential N-glycosylation sites. A phylogenetic tree based on amino acid sequences displays that the goose DRD2 protein is closely related to those of avian species. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrates that the DRD2-1, DRD2-2 and DRD2-4 transcripts are differentially expressed in the pituitary, ovary, hypothalamus, as well as in the kidney, whereas the DRD2-3 transcript is widely expressed in all the examined tissues at different levels. Meanwhile, 54 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 4 insert-deletion (indel) variations were identified in the coding region and partial intron region of the goose DRD2 gene. Those findings will help us gain insight into the functions of the DRD2 gene in geese.

Visual co-orientation with another's gaze direction (gaze following) may provide important information about the location of food, social interactions or predators. Gaze following has been shown in a variety of mammals, but only in few bird species, and has not been tested in precocial birds at all. It has been suggested that gaze following is an anti-predator behaviour, and in Common ravens (Corvus corax) and rooks (C. frugilegus), it emerges shortly after fledging, at a time when young birds leave the predator-safe nest. However, if gaze following is adaptive, the developmental pattern should differ between altricial and precocial birds. Greylag geese (Anser anser) are highly social birds with a precocial development. Goslings move and feed independently within 24 h post-hatching, and they are highly vulnerable to aerial predators. We therefore predicted that greylag geese are capable of gaze following and that they develop this skill already pre-fledging. We experimentally tested 19 hand-raised greylag goslings for their ability to follow a conspecific's gaze when they were between 10 days and 6 weeks old. In line with our predictions, first responses were already detectable in 10-day-old goslings. Our results therefore not only demonstrate that greylag geese follow the gaze of conspecifics into distant space, but that they also develop this ability much earlier than altricial birds.

The carcass yield, physical characteristics, and proximate composition of Egyptian geese (Alopochen aegyptiacus), a southern African gamebird species, have been studied. A total of 69 geese were harvested during 2 seasons: summer (n = 36) and winter (n = 33). This total group of geese consisted of 27 female birds and 42 male birds. Sex alone affected (P ≤ 0.05) the live and carcass weights, and the average muscle weight (g) of each portion was higher for the male fowl. The data does not indicate differences between the meat's physical characteristics on account of sex; however, the meat from the female birds did have a higher intramuscular fat content. Season (winter vs. summer) did not influence the average muscle weights (g) of the breast, thigh, and drumstick portions, but the intramuscular fat content content of the birds hunted in winter was higher. Muscle color and pH differed as a result of season with the summer meat having a higher pH and more vivid red color compared with winter. The physical characteristics and the proximate composition of the breast, thigh, and drumstick portions varied considerably. This is essentially connected to a difference in physical activity of the muscles in the portions. Overall, this study revealed that to ensure a consistent eating quality the harvesting periods of Egyptian geese should be considered.

The resistance of goose (Anser anser f. domestica) eggs to damage was determined by measuring the average rupture force, specific deformation and rupture energy during their compression at different compression speeds (0.0167, 0.167, 0.334, 1.67, 6.68 and 13.36 mm/s). Eggs have been loaded between their poles (along X axis) and in the equator plane (Z axis). The greatest amount of force required to break the eggs was required when eggs were loaded along the X axis and the least compression force was required along the Z axis. This effect of the loading orientation can be described in terms of the eggshell contour curvature. The rate sensitivity of the eggshell rupture force is higher than that observed for the Japanese quail's eggs.

Two incidents are reported in which groups of migrating wild geese were found dead in agricultural fields in southern Manitoba during spring. In each case, the birds died overnight and poisoning was suspected; however, the birds had lesions of severe traumatic injury. The first incident, in 1985, involved about 150 lesser snow geese (Anser caerulescens caerulescens); the second, in 2003, involved 62 Canada geese (Branta canadensis). Both incidents occurred on dark, moonless nights. One possible explanation is that the birds became disoriented in a manner analogous to spatial disorientation described in aircraft pilots and flew as a flock directly into the earth. In the first incident, geese might have been frightened by sonic booms from aircraft; in the second, there was a thunderstorm with strong gusty winds in the area.

Bar-headed geese migrate over the Himalayas at up to 9000 m elevation, but it is unclear how they sustain the high metabolic rates needed for flight in the severe hypoxia at these altitudes. To better understand the basis for this physiological feat, we compared the flight muscle phenotype of bar-headed geese with that of low altitude birds (barnacle geese, pink-footed geese, greylag geese and mallard ducks). Bar-headed goose muscle had a higher proportion of oxidative fibres. This increased muscle aerobic capacity, because the mitochondrial volume densities of each fibre type were similar between species. However, bar-headed geese had more capillaries per muscle fibre than expected from this increase in aerobic capacity, as well as higher capillary densities and more homogeneous capillary spacing. Their mitochondria were also redistributed towards the subsarcolemma (cell membrane) and adjacent to capillaries. These alterations should improve O(2) diffusion capacity from the blood and reduce intracellular O(2) diffusion distances, respectively. The unique differences in bar-headed geese were much greater than the minor variation between low altitude species and existed without prior exercise or hypoxia exposure, and the correlation of these traits to flight altitude was independent of phylogeny. In contrast, isolated mitochondria had similar respiratory capacities, O(2) kinetics and phosphorylation efficiencies across species. Bar-headed geese have therefore evolved for exercise in hypoxia by enhancing the O(2) supply to flight muscle.

With warmer springs, herbivores migrating to Arctic breeding grounds may experience phenological mismatches between their energy demands and the availability of high quality forage. Yet, how the timing of the start of the season and herbivore arrival influences forage quality is often unknown. In coastal western Alaska, approximately one million migratory geese arrive each spring to breed, where foliar %N and C:N ratios are linked to gosling survival and population growth. We conducted a three-year experiment where we manipulated the start of the growing season using warming chambers and grazing times using captive Pacific black brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) to examine how the timing of these events influences the quality of an important forage species. Our results suggest that grazing timing plays a much greater role than an advanced growing season in determining forage quality. All top models included grazing timing, and suggested that compared to typical grazing timing, early grazing significantly reduced foliar %C by 6% and C:N ratios by 16%, while late goose grazing significantly reduced foliar %N by 15% and increased foliar C:N ratios by 21%. While second-ranking top models included the effect of season, the advanced growing season effect was not significant and only reduced %N by 4%, increased %C by <1%, and increased C:N ratios by 5% compared to an ambient growing season. In summary, in years where geese arrive early, they will consume higher quality forage when they arrive and throughout the season, while in years that geese arrive late they will consume lower quality forage when they arrive and for the remainder of the season. When the growing season starts has only a minor influence on this pattern. Our findings suggest that cues determining migration and arrival times to breeding areas are important factors influencing forage quality for geese in western Alaska.

The aim of the performed investigations was to analyse the laying rhythm and reproductive traits of Kołuda white geese from the W11 reproduction strain and to determine the heritability of these traits as well as correlations between the laying rhythm traits and reproductive traits. The total number of geese participating in the experiment included 383 one-year old layers from the control flock (the first year of reproductive utilisation). The following traits characterizing the laying rhythm were assessed individually for each layer: the number of 2 and 3-egg clutches or more, length (in days) of 2- or more egg clutches as well as the length of intervals between the laid eggs during the entire laying period. The following reproductive traits were also assessed individually for each bird: age at sexual maturity, initial number of eggs (eggs laid during the period from January, 1st to April, 30th), number of eggs during the whole laying period, laying intensity (the total number of eggs x 100/length of the laying period in days) as well as the length of the reproductive period. It was found that Kołuda white geese laid most of their eggs (on average 70.2%) singly and not in clutches. With regard to egg clutches, it was found that 2-egg clutches constituted 85.3% of eggs laid in clutches. Moderate or high variability of traits associated with the laying rhythm and reproduction were demonstrated. The observed moderate heritability of the laying rhythm traits indicate that they may be utilised in the selection programs for geese. On the other hand, the reported high, positive genetic correlation coefficients between the number of egg clutches and the initial and total egg number as well as laying intensity confirm the existence of interactions between these traits. This fact may be helpful in breeding programs for determining the optimal selection systems for geese.

China is particularly rich in goose genetic resources. Systematic study of the genetic diversity and origin of Chinese domestic geese will provide an important scientific basis for the conservation and utilization of these resources and for human history. The 521-bp control region (D-loop) of mitochondrial DNA from 26 goose breeds and 6 Landaise geese were sequenced. The results showed that the average haplotype diversity and nucleotide diversity of Chinese domestic geese were 0.1384 and 0.00029, respectively. Shared haplotype analysis and systematic evolution analysis revealed that Chinese domestic geese had 2 maternal origins. The Yili goose breed originated from the Greylag goose (Anser anser), and the other 25 domestic goose breeds originated from the swan goose (Anser cygnoides). An interesting finding was that 1 Linxian white goose and 1 Wanxi white goose shared the same H4 haplotype with the Rhine goose and the Landaise goose, which originated from the Greylag goose (A. anser). Further research on this finding is planned.

Studies of population dynamics of long-lived species have generally focused on adult survival because population growth should be most sensitive to this parameter. However, actual variations in population size can often be driven by other demographic parameters, such as juvenile survival, when they show high temporal variability. We used capture-recapture data from a long-term study of a hunted, migratory species, the greater snow goose (Chen caerulescens atlantica), to assess temporal variability in first-year survival and the relative importance of natural and hunting mortality. We also conducted a parasite-removal experiment to determine the effect of internal parasites and body condition on temporal variation in juvenile survival. We found that juvenile survival showed a higher temporal variability than adult survival and that natural mortality was more important than hunting mortality, unlike in adults. Parasite removal increased first-year survival and reduced its annual variability in females only. Body condition at fledging was also positively correlated with first-year survival in treated females. With reduced parasite load, females, which are thought to invest more in their immune system than males according to Bateman's principle, could probably reallocate more energy to growth than males, leading to a higher survival. Treated birds also had a higher survival than control ones during their second year, suggesting a developmental effect that manifested later in life. Our study shows that natural factors such as internal parasites may be a major source of variation in juvenile survival of a long-lived, migratory bird, which has implications for its population dynamics.

Herbivorous birds are hypothesized to migrate in spring along a seasonal gradient of plant profitability towards their breeding grounds (green wave hypothesis). For Arctic breeding species in particular, following highly profitable food is important, so that they can replenish resources along the way and arrive in optimal body condition to start breeding early. We compared the timing of migratory movements of Arctic breeding geese on different flyways to examine whether flyways differed in the predictability of spring conditions at stopovers and whether this was reflected in the degree to which birds were following the green wave. Barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) were tracked with solar GPS/ARGOS PTTs from their wintering grounds to breeding sites in Greenland (N = 7), Svalbard (N = 21) and the Barents Sea (N = 12). The numerous stopover sites of all birds were combined into a set of 16 general stopover regions. The predictability of climatic conditions along the flyways was calculated as the correlation and slope between onsets of spring at consecutive stopovers. These values differed between sites, mainly because of the presence or absence of ecological barriers. Goose arrival at stopovers was more closely tied to the local onset of spring when predictability was higher and when geese attempted breeding that year. All birds arrived at early stopovers after the onset of spring and arrived at the breeding grounds before the onset of spring, thus overtaking the green wave. This is in accordance with patterns expected for capital breeders: first, they must come into condition; at intermediate stopovers, arrival with the food quality peak is important to stay in condition, and at the breeding grounds, early arrival is favoured so that hatching of young can coincide with the peak of food quality. Our results suggest that a chain of correlations between climatic conditions at subsequent stopovers enables geese to closely track the green wave. However, the birds' precision of migratory timing seems uninfluenced by ecological barriers, indicating partly fixed migration schedules. These might become non-optimal due to climate warming and preclude accurate timing of long-distance migrants in the future.

Simply observing other individuals interacting has been shown to affect subsequent behaviour and also hormones in 'bystander' individuals. However, immediate physiological responses of an observer have been hardly investigated. Here we present results on individuals' heart rate (HR) responses during various situations, which occur regularly in a flock of greylag geese (Anser anser, e.g. agonistic encounters, vehicles passing by). We recorded simultaneously HR and behaviour of 21 semi-tame free-roaming geese, equipped with fully implanted transmitters. We considered 304 social and 81 non-social events during which the focal individuals did not respond behaviourally. Independent of the spatial distance to the event, these HR responses were significantly greater in social contexts (e.g. departing or landing geese, agonistic interactions) than in non-social situations (e.g. vehicles passing by, thunder). Focal individuals showed a significantly higher maximum HR as well as a greater HR increase in response to agonistic interactions, in which the pair partner or a family member was involved, as compared with a non-affiliated goose. Also, HR was significantly higher when the bystander watched non-affiliated geese interacting, which were higher ranking than the focal. We conclude that these differences are due to different relevance of the recorded events for the focal individual, depending on the individuals involved in the observed interaction.

CD3 is one of the most important cell surface markers of T lymphocytes, and has an important function in signal transmission during antigen recognition. In this study, monoclonal antibodies against goose CD3ɛ extracellular domain were developed and characterized for the first time. The purified recombinant goose CD3ɛ extracellular domain protein and pcDNA3.1-GoCD3ɛex were used as immunogens to develop mAbs. Furthermore, recombinant protein was used to screen for mAbs. The characteristics of mAbs were identified through IFA, I-ELISA, Western blot, FCM, and LSCM analyzes. Results showed that mAbs 3C11 and 5A3 may be good candidates for use in detecting goose T lymphocytes and in immunoassaying and exploring the function of the CD3ɛ molecule.

The resident Dutch Northern Delta barnacle geese Branta leucopsis population expanded steadily since birds first bred in 1982, increasing agricultural conflict. Derogation shooting has been used since 2005 to scare geese from sensitive crops and to reduce population size. Numbers almost doubled to ca. 28 000 individuals during 2007-2014, despite annual removal of 15-25% of geese and adult and juvenile survival rates of 79 and 67% (cf. natural survival of 96% for both age classes). Simple population modelling, using estimated annual survival values and fixed fecundity, predicted a moderate increase to 21 500 individuals in 2014. It is unclear whether current harvest levels are sufficient to halt population growth. Shooting may be less effective because of the disproportionate take of immature post-breeding and of individuals from other populations in winter. Discrepancies between counted and modelled abundance call for caution and improved effect monitoring of derogation shooting before harvest levels are increased further.

The feeding activities of Egyptian geese are becoming a problem for crop farmers in South Africa. Their grain-based diet during the harvesting season compared to the diet during the rest of the year may have an influence on the meat quality, especially the sensory profile. Descriptive sensory analysis, physical measurements, and the proximate composition were used to investigate these effects. Season was a major influential factor with the meat from summer associating with sweet-oily-duck and beef attributes in contrast to the strong association towards the game, metallic, and fish attributes of the winter meat. This is due to the difference in the main fatty acids; winter was higher (P ≤ 0.05) in polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA: ) (C18:3 n-3) and summer higher (P ≤ 0.05) in monounsaturated fatty acid (C18:1 n-9). This study established that season has a significant effect on the sensory profile of Egyptian goose meat and should be considered regarding the utilization and consumption.

The aim of the study was to compare the chemical and amino acid composition of breast (pectoralis major) and thigh (biceps femoris) muscles in 17-wk-old geese from 2 Polish conservative flocks: Rypińska (Ry, n = 20) and Garbonosa (Ga, n = 20). The geese were fed ad libitum during the experimental period on the same complete feed. Genotypes affected the moisture and fat content of breast and thigh meat. The Ga geese were characterized by higher moisture as well as lower fat lipid content compared with the Ry breast and thigh muscles. The amino acid proportions of meat proteins depended on the goose flock and type of muscles, where significant differences were found. The proteins of Ga breast muscles contained more glutamic acid, glycine, lysine, tryptophan, histidine, and methionine, and less aspartic acid, proline, serine, leucine, valine, phenyloalanine, tyrosine, and threonine than the Ry geese (P ≤ 0.05). The proteins of Ry thigh muscles were characterized by higher content of proline, serine, and essential amino acids (without lysine and methionine) and lower glutamic and asparagine acid, alanine, and glycine compared with the Ga flock. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations/World Health Organization (1991) standard, tryptophan was the amino acid limiting the nutritional value of meat proteins of Ry breast muscles (amino acid score for tryptophan = 90%). Except for tryptophan, the meat proteins of the investigated raw materials contained more essential amino acids than the standard. The total content of essential amino acids for all investigated muscles was also higher (52.51 to 55.54%) than the standard (33.90%). It is evident that muscle protein from both flocks of geese have been characterized by high nutritional value. The values of the essential amino acid index of breast muscle proteins were similar in both flocks.

GPR103 plays an important role in various tissues, while little information is available about the alternative splicing (AS) of its mRNA. In the present study, we used genomic PCR to identify the partial genomic locus of goose (Anser cygnoides) GPR103 and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR to identify five GPR103 variants, including the full-length variant (aGPR103-n) and four alternatively spliced variants (aGPR103-va, -vb, -vc and -vd). Sequence analysis showed that aGPR103-va and -vd are less likely to undergo nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, suggesting that they may be translated into truncated proteins. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that the five variants are widely distributed in the brain and peripheral tissues of geese and show specific expression patterns. Thus, we here provide the first account of the GPR103 genomic locus and illustrate its transcriptional diversity and widespread distribution in geese.

To explore the relationship between Myf5 gene polymorphisms and production performance traits in Songliao white geese, we used the chicken Myf5 sequence to design primers and amplified part of the exon 1 sequence of the Songliao white goose Myf5 gene. Results of single-strand conformation polymorphism polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed polymorphisms of the amplified fragment, including three genotypes (AA, AB, and BB). Three varieties were dominated by allele A and were mainly expressed in AA genotypes. We also identified that the Myf5 gene has one single nucleotide change (A→G) on exon 1 at locus 1344, and another (G→C) at locus 1410. Analysis of variance showed significant differences between genotypes before slaughter in live weight, carcass weight, eviscerated weight, leg muscle weight, weight of the wings, and slaughter rate. There were no significant differences with respect to other growth and carcass traits evaluated.

Knowledge of the genetic and environmental influences on a character is pivotal for understanding evolutionary changes in quantitative traits in natural populations. Dominance and aggression are ubiquitous traits that are selectively advantageous in many animal societies and have the potential to impact the evolutionary trajectory of animal populations. Here we provide age- and sex-specific estimates of additive genetic and environmental components of variance for dominance rank and aggression rate in a free-living, human-habituated bird population subject to natural selection. We use a long-term data set on individually marked greylag geese (Anser anser) and show that phenotypic variation in dominance-related behaviours contains significant additive genetic variance, parental effects and permanent environment effects. The relative importance of these variance components varied between age and sex classes, whereby the most pronounced differences concerned nongenetic components. In particular, parental effects were larger in juveniles of both sexes than in adults. In paired adults, the partner's identity had a larger influence on male dominance rank and aggression rate than in females. In sex- and age-specific estimates, heritabilities did not differ significantly between age and sex classes. Adult dominance rank was only weakly genetically correlated between the sexes, leading to considerably higher heritabilities in sex-specific estimates than across sexes. We discuss these patterns in relation to selection acting on dominance rank and aggression in different life history stages and sexes and suggest that different adaptive optima could be a mechanism for maintaining genetic variation in dominance-related traits in free-living animal populations.

In this study, we cloned and sequenced the complete mitochondrial DNAs of Chinese goose, Anser cygnoides populations from three different areas of Hunan province in China. The Anser cygnoides breed Wugangtong white goose (WGTW) sample and Wugangtong grey goose sample (WGTG) were taken from the Wugang county of Shaoyang city, the Anser cygnoides breed Xupu goose (XP) sample was taken from the Xupu county of Huaihua city, and the Anser cygnoides breed Yanling white goose (YLW) sample was taken from the Yanling county of Zhuzhou city. The organization of the four Anser cygnoides breeds mitochondrial genomes was similar. Phylogenetic analyses using N-J computational algorithms showed that the analyzed species are divided into four major clades: Anatinae, Anserinae, Dendrocygninae and Anseranatidae. It was noted that Wugangtong white goose, Yanling white goose and Xupu goose have highly similar phylogenetic relationship.

A newly emerged duck parvovirus, which causes beak atrophy and dwarfism syndrome (BADS) in Cherry Valley ducks, has appeared in Northern China since March 2015. To explore the genetic diversity among waterfowl parvovirus isolates, the complete genome of an identified isolate designated SDLC01 was sequenced and analyzed in the present study. Genomic sequence analysis showed that SDLC01 shared 90.8%-94.6% of nucleotide identity with goose parvovirus (GPV) isolates and 78.6%-81.6% of nucleotide identity with classical Muscovy duck parvovirus (MDPV) isolates. Phylogenetic analysis of 443 nucleotides (nt) of the fragment A showed that SDLC01 was highly similar to a mule duck isolate (strain D146/02) and close to European GPV isolates but separate from Asian GPV isolates. Analysis of the left inverted terminal repeat regions revealed that SDLC01 had two major segments deleted between positions 160-176 and 306-322 nt compared with field GPV and MDPV isolates. Phylogenetic analysis of Rep and VP1 encoded by two major open reading frames of parvoviruses revealed that SDLC01 was distinct from all GPV and MDPV isolates. The viral pathogenicity and genome characterization of SDLC01 suggest that the novel GPV (N-GPV) is the causative agent of BADS and belongs to a distinct GPV-related subgroup. Furthermore, N-GPV sequences were detected in diseased ducks by polymerase chain reaction and viral proliferation was demonstrated in duck embryos and duck embryo fibroblast cells.

Phylogenetic analysis of 1.35 kb of mtDNA sequence from fossils revealed a previously unknown radiation of Hawaiian geese, of which only one representative remains alive (the endangered Hawaiian goose or nene, Branta sandvicensis). This radiation is nested phylogenetically within a living species, the Canada goose (Branta canadensis) and is related most closely to the large-bodied lineage within that species. The barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis) is also nested within the Canada goose species and is related most closely to the small-bodied lineage of Canada geese. The peripheral isolation of the barnacle goose in the Palearctic apparently allowed the evolution of its distinctive plumage pattern, whereas the two Nearctic lineages of Canada geese share a primitive plumage pattern. The Hawaiian lineage of Canada geese diverged more dramatically, splitting into at least three species that differ in body size, body proportions, and flight ability. One fossil species, limited to the island of Hawaii, was related closely to the nene but was over four times larger, flightless, heavy-bodied and had a much more robust cranium. Application of a rate calibration to levels of DNA divergence suggests that this species evolved on the island of Hawaii in less than 500,000 years. This date is consistent with the potassium/argon-based age of the island of Hawaii of 430,000-500,000 years. The giant Hawaii goose resembles the moa-nalos, a group of massive, extinct, flightless ducks that lived on older Hawaiian Islands and thus is an example of convergent evolution of similar morphologies in island ecosystems.

The ENO1 gene encodes a multifunctional enzyme that has been identified as a key component of the glycolytic pathway. Our previous studies demonstrated that ENO1 gene expression was higher in the ovaries of laying geese compared with prelaying geese. However, the molecular characterisation and expression profiling of the ENO1 gene in geese tissues and ovarian follicles remain to be determined. In this study, ENO1 cDNA (1,445 bp long) of the Sichuan white goose was cloned and characterised. The ORF of ENO1 cDNA is 1,305 bp in length and encodes a 434 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 47.27 kDa. ENO1 expression in all of the examined tissues was the highest in spleen and the lowest in breast muscle. High expression of ENO1 appeared in the kidney, liver, adrenal gland, and retina. With increasing follicle growth, ENO1 gene expression began to decrease from the small white follicle to F5, which was followed by a sharp increase in expression in F4 and then a gradual decrease in expression from F3 to F1. Furthermore, in the postovulatory follicles (POF), the levels of ENO1 gene expression decreased gradually from POF1 to POF4. In conclusion, the ENO1 transcript was widely distributed in various tissues of the Sichuan white goose, but ENO1 expression was tissue-specific. Furthermore, the results of the ENO1 expression profiling of ovarian follicles suggest that ENO1 may play an important dual role in the progress of follicular development, where ENO1 acts as a glycolytic enzyme and also mediates apoptosis.

Plasma protein electrophoresis is recognized as a reliable diagnostic tool in avian medicine; however, the influence of circannual phenomena such as molt on protein electrophoregrams is poorly documented. The molt is a period of heavy hormonal and metabolic change in birds. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of molt on total protein concentration and electrophoresis patterns in birds. Blood samples were taken from 19 Bar-headed Geese (Anser indicus) from mid-May to mid-August, at 15-day intervals. At the same time, molting stage of each bird was recorded. Total protein concentrations were measured and plasma agarose gel electrophoresis was performed on these samples. The Bar-headed Goose was chosen as a model, because they molt over a very short period. The total protein concentration and albumin, alpha-2, beta, and gamma fractions were at their minimum values during molt, whereas the prealbumin and alpha-1 fractions rose to their maximum levels. This study provides baseline information relevant to changes occurring in avian proteinograms throughout the molt. The increase in prealbumin and alpha-1 fractions may be related to an increase in plasma thyroid hormones during molt. The decrease observed in albumin, alpha-2, beta, and gamma fractions may be related to protein and energy shifts toward feather growth, as well as to an expansion of the circulatory system located around the feather follicles with secondary dilutional effects on protein fractions. From a clinical point of view, the observed changes associated with molting were less significant than initially expected, and would not likely results in incorrect diagnoses based on interpretation of the protein electrophoretic patterns.

Social species that maintain individualised relationships with certain others despite continuous changes in age, reproductive status and dominance rank between group members ought to be capable of individual recognition. Tests of "true" individual recognition, where an individual recognises unique features of another, are rare, however. Often kinship and/or familiarity suffice to explain dyadic interactions. The complex relationships within a greylag goose flock suggest that they should be able to recognise individuals irrespective of familiarity or kinship. We tested whether six-week-old hand-raised greylags can discriminate between two of their siblings. We developed a new experimental protocol, in which geese were trained to associate social siblings with geometrical symbols. Subsequently, focals were presented with two geometrical symbols in the presence of a sibling associated with one of the symbols. Significant choice of the geometrical symbol associated with the target present indicated that focals were able to distinguish between individual targets. Greylag goslings successfully learned this association-discrimination task, regardless of genetic relatedness or sex of the sibling targets. Social relationships within a goose flock thus may indeed be based on recognition of unique features of individual conspecifics.

The ornithine decarboxylase antizyme 2 (OAZ2) gene is a member of the antizyme gene family. Antizymes play pivotal roles in various cellular pathways, including polyamine anabolism and apoptosis. The molecular structure and expression profile of the OAZ2 in goose ovarian follicles have not been reported. In this study, the OAZ2 cDNA sequence of the Sichuan white goose was cloned (Anser cygnoides), and phylogenetic and structural analyses of the OAZ2 were performed. The expression profiling of OAZ2 mRNA in goose ovarian follicles was examined using quantitative real-time PCR. The sequence analysis showed that the 756 bp OAZ2 sequence contained two overlapping open reading frames (ORF). ORF1 was 99 bp in length, and encoded a 32 aa polypeptide. ORF2 was 477 bp in length, and encoded a 158 aa polypeptide. The frameshift site that initiates the translation of ORF2 was located at nucleotide position 97 in the OAZ2. The analysis of OAZ2 mRNA expression in hierarchical follicles showed that the level of OAZ2 mRNA was higher in the SWF and F2 follicular stages than that in the ovarian stroma (P<0.05). The lowest level of OAZ2 expression was detected in the ovarian stroma. These results suggest that the highly conserved frameshift region plays an important role in sustaining the function of OAZs. Furthermore, the significantly higher level of OAZ2 mRNA in the SWF stage indicates that OAZ2 may be involved in recruiting hierarchical follicles. Our results also suggest that OAZ2 may augment the effects of OAZ1 in follicle development.

1. White Italian geese (40 males and 40 females) were reared until 12 weeks of age and fed standard diets ad libitum. After rearing ended, the geese were weighed (males-5216 g, females-4945 g) and killed. Carcases were chilled and skin slices with subcutaneous fat removed. The remaining part of the carcase was dissected into meat, intermuscular fat and bones. 2. The weight of a skin slice with subcutaneous fat, taken from the carcase surface excluding the forewings and wing tips (X2), and the weight of a carcase excluding this slice, the forewings and wing tips (X1) were very good indicators of the content of skin with fat (r > 0.99) and meat (r > 0.98) in a whole carcase. 3. The above traits provided a basis for deriving regression equations to estimate the content of meat (Y) or skin with subcutaneous and intermuscular fat (U) in whole carcases of White Italian geese. The following equations are recommended for practical application: Y = 0.755X1 - 27.8 (Sy = 26.3 g); U = 1.070X2 + 19.5 (Su = 11.4 g).

The Chinese goose is one of the most economically important poultry birds and is a natural reservoir for many avian viruses. However, the nature and regulation of the innate and adaptive immune systems of this waterfowl species are not completely understood due to limited information on the goose genome. Recently, transcriptome sequencing technology was applied in the genomic studies focused on novel gene discovery. Thus, this study described the transcriptome of the goose peripheral blood lymphocytes to identify immunity relevant genes.

Prolactin receptor (PRLR) is a single transmembrane protein through which prolactin plays a wide variety of physiological roles in vertebrates. To understand its role in goose behavior, we cloned the gene of goose PRLR (gPRLR) in the Siji goose, a domestic goose with strong broodiness in China, and examined its expression level in different organs of adult geese. Our results showed that gPRLR cDNA contained 443 bp 5' untranslated region, 2,496 bp coding sequence that presumably comprises at least 14 exons, and 220 bp 3' untranslated region. The predicted goose PRLR contained 831 amino acids and exhibited identities of 87.7, 85.2, and 84.8% with chicken, pigeon, and turkey PRLR, respectively. It comprised a signal peptide of 24 amino acids at the N terminus, 2 ligand binding regions of the extracellular domain, each containing 2 pairs of cysteine residues and a pentapeptide of 5 amino acids known as WS motif (Tpr-Ser-any amino acid-Tpr-Ser), the 2 typical features highly conserved in the members of class 1 cytokine receptor superfamily. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the goose PRLR is highly conserved during evolution. In addition, we discovered 2 other alternative splicing transcripts of gPRLR. One is generated by missing the last 95 bp of the first 330 bp of the 3,159 bp cDNA. The other is produced by an alternative transcription initiation, leading to creation of a novel first exon that is directly spliced to the third exon. Reverse transcription PCR analyses show that the gPRLR mRNA is widely expressed in the testis, seminal duct, ovary, oviduct, kidney, large intestine, and small intestine.

Microsatellite sequences are important markers for population genetics studies. In the past, the development of adequate microsatellite primers has been cumbersome. However with the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies, marker identification in genomes of non-model species has been greatly simplified. Here we describe microsatellite discovery on a Pacific Biosciences single molecule real-time sequencer. For the Greater White-fronted Goose (Anser albifrons), we identified 316 microsatellite loci in a single genome shotgun sequencing experiment. We found that the capability of handling large insert sizes and high quality circular consensus sequences provides an advantage over short read technologies for primer design. Combined with a straightforward amplification-free library preparation, PacBio sequencing is an economically viable alternative for microsatellite discovery and subsequent PCR primer design.

This study was carried out to reveal the morphological features of Meckel's diverticulum (MD) in geese. For this purpose, a total of 36 adult healthy geese of both sexes, 50-52 weeks of age, were used. The mean weight of MD in male was found to be significantly larger than that of female. It was located a little distal to the midpoint of the small intestine in both sexes. It had a lot of lymphoid tissues, the simple columnar epithelium and a small number of crypts, and was a lack of villi, and its muscularis mucosae was very thin. Results from this study are thought to throw light on future studies on MD and proper diagnosis of pathological disorders related to it, and to contribute considerably to the present anatomical knowledge on MD in geese.

Volumes of brain and brain subdivisions in greylag and domestic geese are determined by cytoarchitectonical methods in order to confirm the reduction in brain weight of 16.13% due to domestication which was described in an earlier study. Olfactory structures, nucleus basalis and the 'piriform' corticoid layer are found to be particular different in shape and position compared to other birds, especially the pigeon. The volumes of brain parts in relation to the total brain are very similar in both: greylag geese and domestic geese. The extent of changes in brain parts due to domestication varies. The decrease of the prosencephalon by 18.8% is double the size of the rhombencephalon (9%). Remarkable are the reduction values of the tectum opticum (21.8%), the tractus opticus (37.3%), the hyperstriatum ventrale (26.1%), the archistriatum (22.4%), and the hippocampus (31%). Changes in brain size are compared with observations found in other domesticated birds. Evolutional, functional and environmental connexions are discussed as well.

The effect of insulin on the removal of plasma triglycerides was tested in hepatectomized geese. In this preparation plasma triglyceride concentration decreases exponentially following hepatectomy. Infusion of insulin (0.001 U/kg/min. for 60 minutes) had no significant effect on the rate of disappearance of plasma triglycerides in the hepatectomized animals. The conclusion is, therefore, reached that insulin does not affect the removal of plasma triglycerides by the extrahepatic tissues in the goose.

The primary feather follicles are universal skin appendages widely distributed in the skin of feathered birds. The morphogenesis and development of the primary feather follicles in goose skin remain largely unknown. Here, the induction of primary feather follicles in goose embryonic skin (pre-induction vs induction) was investigated by de novo transcriptome analyses to reveal 409 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The DEGs were characterized to potentially regulate the de novo formation of feather follicle primordia consisting of placode (4 genes) and dermal condensate (12 genes), and the thickening of epidermis (5 genes) and dermal fibroblasts (17 genes), respectively. Further analyses enriched DEGs into GO terms represented as cell adhesion and KEGG pathways including Wnt and Hedgehog signaling pathways that are highly correlated with cell communication and molecular regulation. Six selected Wnt pathway genes were detected by qPCR with up-regulation in goose skin during the induction of primary feather follicles. The localization of WNT16, SFRP1 and FRZB by in situ hybridization showed weak expression in the primary feather primordia, whereas FZD1, LEF1 and DKK1 were expressed initially in the inter-follicular skin and feather follicle primordia, then mainly restricted in the feather primordia. The spatial-temporal expression patterns indicate that Wnt pathway genes DKK1, FZD1 and LEF1 are the important regulators functioned in the induction of primary feather follicle in goose skin. The dynamic molecular changes and specific gene expression patterns revealed in this report provide the general knowledge of primary feather follicle and skin development in waterfowl, and contribute to further understand the diversity of hair and feather development beyond the mouse and chicken models.

A fat-mobilizing substance (FMS) was extracted from the urine of fasting, ad-libitum-fed or over-fed colostomized geese. Injection of these materials into geese and cockerels caused increases in plasma-free fatty acids (FFA). A marked anorexigenic effect was obtained in cockerels only, by the FMS obtained from ad-libitum-fed geese. The daily amount of FMS excreted in the urine was proportional to the amount of feed consumed.

This paper presents results from a multidisciplinary study of a negotiation process between farmers and wildlife authorities which led to an agricultural subsidy scheme to alleviate conflicts between agriculture and geese in Norway. The Svalbard-breeding population of pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus has increased considerably over the last decades and conflicts with farmers have escalated, especially at stopover sites in spring when geese feed on newly sprouted pasture grass. In Vesterålen, an important stopover site for geese in North Norway, farmers deployed scaring of geese at varying intensity dependent on the level of conflict during 1988-2012. We assessed the efficiency of a subsidy scheme established in 2006, in terms of its conflict mitigation, reflected in a near discontinuation of scaring activities. The presence of pink-footed geese was analysed in relation to scaring intensity, the total goose population size and the increasing occurrence of another goose species, the barnacle goose Branta leucopsis. Scaring significantly affected the number of geese staging in Vesterålen, both in absolute and relative terms (controlling for total population size). The geese responded immediately to an increased, and reduced, level of scaring. Despite the establishment of the subsidy scheme, the number of pink-footed geese has recently declined which is probably caused by the increasing number of barnacle geese. For the farmers, the subsidy scheme provides funding that reduces the economic costs caused by the geese. Sustaining a low level of conflict will require close monitoring, dialogue and adaptation of the subsidy scheme to cater for changes in goose population dynamics.

Nesting migratory geese are among the dominant herbivores in (sub) arctic environments, which have undergone unprecedented increases in temperatures and plant growing days over the last three decades. Within these regions, the Hudson Bay Lowlands are home to an overabundant breeding population of lesser snow geese that has dramatically damaged the ecosystem, with cascading effects at multiple trophic levels. In some areas the overabundance of geese has led to a drastic reduction in available forage. In addition, warming of this region has widened the gap between goose migration timing and plant green-up, and this 'mismatch' between goose and plant phenologies could in turn affect gosling development. The dual effects of climate change and habitat quality on gosling body condition and juvenile survival are not known, but are critical for predicting population growth and related degradation of (sub) arctic ecosystems. To address these issues, we used information on female goslings marked and measured between 1978 and 2005 (4125 individuals). Goslings that developed within and near the traditional center of the breeding colony experienced the effects of long-term habitat degradation: body condition and juvenile survival declined over time. In newly colonized areas, however, we observed the opposite pattern (increase in body condition and juvenile survival). In addition, warmer than average winters and summers resulted in lower gosling body condition and first-year survival. Too few plant 'growing days' in the spring relative to hatch led to similar results. Our assessment indicates that geese are recovering from habitat degradation by moving to newly colonized locales. However, a warmer climate could negatively affect snow goose populations in the long-run, but it will depend on which seasons warm the fastest. These antagonistic mechanisms will require further study to help predict snow goose population dynamics and manage the trophic cascade they induce.

The Scottish island of Islay hosts 45 000 barnacle geese Branta leucopsis (56% of the Greenland barnacle goose population, plus those passing through on migration), 5000 Greenland white-fronted geese Anser albifrons flavirostris (up to 30% of the world population) and 2500 greylag geese Anser anser, most of which feed on 9000 ha of grassland. The financial impacts of estimated agricultural damage have risen greatly over the past 20 years due to increasing goose numbers and higher farming costs. Mechanisms implemented to resolve conflict over time are reviewed for their effectiveness. Emphasis is placed on coordinating the implementation of strategic national conflict resolution at a local scale where the relative pressure from internationally important concentrations of geese on agriculture is acute. Despite the "local" nature of this problem, the benefit from the experience of decades of attempted conflict resolution and the effectiveness of existing programmes can contribute much to the regional and flyway dimensions of this international issue.

Mitochondrial DNA was purified from five American species of geese representing the genera Anser and Branta, which have fossil records. The results of electrophoretic comparisons of about 75 fragments per individual produced by 14 restriction enzymes imply that the mean extent of sequence divergence between species of Anser and Branta is about 9%. Fossil evidence suggests that these two groups of geese had a common ancestor 4-5 million years ago. Thus, the mean rate of sequence divergence in goose mitochondrial DNA is not far from 2% per million years, the value in mammals.

The seasonal decline of avian clutch size may result from the conflict between the advantage of early breeding (greater offspring value) and the advantage of a delay in lay date (improved body condition and hence clutch size). We tested predictions of a condition-dependent individual optimization model based on this trade-off (Rowe et al. 1994) in a long-distance migrant, the greater snow goose (Chen caerulescens atlantica), using data on condition, migration, and reproductive decisions of individuals. We closely tracked radio-marked females at their main spring staging area and on their breeding grounds. Our results were consistent with predictions of the model. Early-arriving females had a longer prelaying period and initiated their nests earlier than late arrivals. After controlling statistically for arrival date, we determined that females with high premigration condition had an earlier lay date than those in low condition. After controlling for the seasonal decline (i.e., lay date), we observed that clutch size was not related to premigration condition. Moreover, we took advantage of an unplanned manipulation of the prebreeding condition that occurred during our long-term study. We found that a reduction in condition caused a delay in lay date. However, after controlling for the seasonal decline, it did not affect clutch size. Our study indicates that geese simultaneously adjust their lay date and clutch size according to their premigration condition and migratory behavior as predicted by the condition-dependent optimization model.

1. Evidence has accumulated in mammals to support the idea that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions and mutations might contribute to ageing and reproductive failure. White Roman geese were monitored to evaluate the effect of large-scale deletions of mtDNA in an avian species. 2. A total of 340 samples from 114 dead embryos, 111 weak goslings, and 115 normal goslings were used in this experiment. The regions of these two large-scale mtDNA deletions, ΔmtDNA6829 and ΔmtDNA6992, were between the COI and ND5 genes. A 3·6% (4 out of 111) positive sample was detected in the weak goslings. In contrast, no large-scale mitochondrial DNA deletions were detected in either the dead embryos (0 out of 114) or the normal goslings (0 out of 115). 3. Large-scale mtDNA deletions may be a factor causing weak goslings.

The aerobic fecal flora of wintering Brent Goos (Branta bernicla), Barnacle Goose (Branta leucopsis), Greylag Goose (Anser anser), White-fronted Goose (Anser albifrons), Pink-footed Goose (Anser brachyrhynchus), and Bean Goose (Anser fabalis) was studied. There were no specific differences between the various geese. Bacterial counts were in the range of 10(5)-10(7) CPU per gram of feces. Neither pathogenic bacteria nor rotavirus could be detected in the fecal samples of the wintering geese, so that a contamination of the environment with those pathogenic organisms could be excluded. The majority of the isolated bacteria belonged to the genera Bacillus and Pseudomonas; enterobacteria and streptococci were less common. The observations are discussed regarding their epidemiological and ecological significance.

Variation in immune defence in birds is often explained either by external factors such as food availability and disease pressure or by internal factors such as moult and reproductive effort. We explored these factors together in one sampling design by measuring immune activity over the time frame of the moulting period of Arctic-breeding barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis). We assessed baseline innate immunity by measuring levels of complement-mediated lysis and natural antibody-mediated agglutination together with total and differential leukocyte counts. Variation in immune activity during moult was strongly associated with calendar date and to a smaller degree with the growth stage of wing feathers. We suggest that the association with calendar date reflected temporal changes in the external environment. This environmental factor was further explored by comparing the immune activity of geese in the Arctic population with conspecifics in the temperate climate zone at comparable moult stages. In the Arctic environment, which has a lower expected disease load, geese exhibited significantly lower values of complement-mediated lysis, their blood contained fewer leukocytes, and levels of phagocytic cells and reactive leukocytes were relatively low. This suggests that lower baseline immune activity could be associated with lower disease pressure. We conclude that in our study species, external factors such as food availability and disease pressure have a greater effect on temporal variation of baseline immune activity than internal factors such as moult stage.

Dead space volume (VD) was altered in spontaneously breathing, anesthetized geese from values far above (about 115 ml) to those far below (about 3 ml) the normal VD (approximately 40 ml). Respiratory gases were measured in cranial (CrS) and caudal air sacs (CdS) and in blood. The major findings were as follows: Ventilation increased linearly with VD, by increases in tidal volume (VT) at constant breathing rate (fresp); effective parabronchial ventilation, (VT-VD) X fresp, remained constant and so did arterial blood gases. No changes occurred in CrS gas composition. CdS PCO2 declined with decreasing VD, and the respiratory exchange ratio increased, reaching values above unity at the lowest VD. The gas composition in CrS, and particularly its relation to end-expired gas composition, is in agreement with current models of the gas flow pattern in the avian lung. The PCO2 values in CdS are higher than expected by simple models, e.g. by dead space re-inhalation. Neopulmonic gas exchange and incomplete gas mixing are suggested to contribute significantly to the gas composition of CdS.

Migratory birds are of particular interest for population genetics because of the high connectivity between habitats and populations. A high degree of connectivity requires using many genetic markers to achieve the required statistical power, and a genome wide SNP set can fit this purpose. Here we present the development of a genome wide SNP set for the Barnacle Goose Branta leucopsis, a model species for the study of bird migration. We used the genome of a different waterfowl species, Mallard Anas platyrhynchos, as a reference to align Barnacle Goose second generation sequence reads from an RRL library and detected 2188 SNPs genome wide. Furthermore, we used chimeric flanking sequences, merged from both Mallard and Barnacle Goose DNA sequence information, to create primers for validation by genotyping. Validation with a 384 SNP genotyping set resulted in 374 (97%) successfully typed SNPs in the assay, of which 358 (96%) were polymorphic. Additionally, we validated our SNPs on relatively old (30 years) museum samples, which resulted in a success rate of at least 80%. This shows that museum samples could be used in standard SNP genotyping assays. Our study also shows that the genome of a related species can be used as reference to detect genome wide SNPs in birds, because genomes of birds are highly conserved. This is illustrated by the use of chimeric flanking sequences, which showed that the incorporation of flanking nucleotides from Mallard into Barnacle Goose sequences lead to equal genotyping performance when compared to flanking sequences solely composed of Barnacle Goose sequence.

In the present study, arterial vascularization of the uropygial glands (Gl. uropygialis) of 10 adult geese (Anser anser) and 10 adult ducks (Anas platyrhynches) were studied. Takilon was injected into the median coccygeal arteries of six specimens from each species, and Latex (a natural rubber with ammonia) into those of four specimens. Takilon-injected specimens were corrosion casted, and arteries nourishing the gland were revealed via dissection. Vascularization of the uropygial glands of both the goose and the duck was observed to be the right (a. gl. uropygii dextra), left (a. gl. uropygi sinistra) and ventral (a. gl. uropygi ventralis) glandular uropygial arteries, arising from the median coccygeal (a. coccygea media) artery. Both the right and left glandular uropygial arteries were observed, divided into four branches as follows; muscular ramus (ramus muscularis), medial ramus (ramus medialis), ventral ramus (ramus ventralis) and lateral ramus (ramus lateralis). Of these, as the lateral, medial and ventral branches feed the gland, the muscular branch provides blood for the lateral coccygeal (m. coccygealis lateralis) and levator coccygeal (m. levator coccygealis) muscles, and the skin. Among the arteries mentioned above, anastomosis between the first and the second branches of the right ventral uropygial arteries in the five geese and five ducks was found.

1. The conchae within the nasal cavity of poultry are important for water and energy conservation, but have not been experimentally evaluated. The aim of the present study was to determine the accuracy of volume and volume fraction estimates of the conchae, nasal septum and nasal cavity. 2. The nasal cavities of 7 adult goose heads were scanned using computed tomography (CT), with images sampled randomly at a 1/5 sampling fraction. Physical sections were obtained from the same samples, using an electric saw that had an adjustable section range, and provided 14 to 15 sections with a thickness of 2.5 mm. The section surface areas of the nasal cavity, nasal septum and conchae were estimated using the Cavalieri principle. Results obtained using the CT and physical section images were compared. Volumes and volume fractions obtained from the physical sections were accepted as the gold standard and differences in the CT images were determined. 3. Multiplication of the data obtained on the CT images with the deviation percentage of the physical sections produced normalised values. No differences were observed between the gold standard data and the CT images. While it was possible to normalise the obtained data using the gold standard values, the raw data could also be used for comparative studies because the deviations from normal would be similar for all groups. 4. Our study showed that the nasal structures could be estimated in vivo using CT images.

Inspiratory airflow in the avian lung completely bypasses the most cranial secondary bronchi (the ventrobronchi), and instead enters bronchi arising more caudally (the dorsobronchi). Dotterweich (1936) proposed that 'aerodynamic valves' prevented entry into the ventrobronchi. We have recently provided evidence that inspiratory aerodynamic valving in avian lungs depends on convective inertia in the primary bronchus (Banzett et al., 1987). Theoretical and physical models (Butler et al., 1988; Wang et al., 1988) showed that convective inertia could effect valving, but the effectiveness of valving at resting flows was less than that observed in the bird. This leads us to hypothesize that a segment of the primary bronchus is constricted, accelerating the gas and enhancing the convective inertia. To test this hypothesis in the present work we measured pressures throughout the airways and air sacs in anesthetized, pump-ventilated geese at different flow rates and gas densities. Our data show: (1) there is a large pressure drop in the primary bronchus close to the ventrobronchial junction, indicating the presence of a constriction; (2) this pressure drop increases with gas density and flow; (3) the convective inertia at this site is more than 10 times downstream opposing pressures. We conclude that the primary bronchus just cranial to the first ventrobronchus forms a constriction which accelerates inspired air. Furthermore, we conclude that the convective inertia of gas leaving this segment is sufficient to achieve inspiratory valving.

Bar-headed geese (Anser indicus) migrate over the Himalayan mountains, at altitudes up to 9000 m above sea level, where air density and oxygen availability are extremely low. This study determined whether alterations in wing morphology or wingbeat frequency during free flight have evolved in this species to facilitate extreme high altitude migration, by comparing it to several closely related goose species. Wingspan and wing loading scaled near isometrically with body mass across all species (with power scaling exponents of 0.22 and 0.47, respectively), and wingbeat frequency scaled negatively to mass (scaling exponent of -0.167). Bar-headed geese had the largest wingspan residual and smallest wing loading residual from these allometric relationships, suggesting that they are at the top end of the wing size distribution. These morphological characters of bar-headed geese were not outside the normal variation exhibited by low altitude species, however, being within the prediction intervals of the regression. This was particularly true after the data were corrected for phylogeny using the independent contrasts method. Wingbeat frequencies of bar-headed geese during steady flight were the same as low altitude geese, both with and without correcting for phylogeny. Without adjusting other kinematic features (e.g., wing motion and generated wake structure) to supplement lift generation in low air densities, the metabolic costs of flight in bar-headed geese at high altitude could exceed the already high costs at sea level. The apparent lack of morphological and kinematic adaptation emphasizes the importance of physiological adaptations for enhancing oxygen transport and utilization in this species.

Plasma glucose and insulin levels were measured in chronically catheterized, freely moving, undisturbed geese, which were offered a free standard meal after an overnight fast. The insulin level markedly rose within the first minute after the start of food ingestion, whereas plasma glucose did not increase. This early insulin response was not correlated with the size of the meal. In contrast, both postabsorptive insulin response and plasma glucose changes were dependent on meal size. When a small amount of food (2-6 g) was eaten, insulin returned to basal level within 30 min, whereas plasma glucose remained unchanged. Larger meals (15-20 g) maintained plasma insulin at a higher level and induced a sustained rise of plasma glucose. These results indicate that there is a cephalic phase of insulin secretion at the beginning of the meal in birds as previously described in mammals.

An uneven change in climate across the Northern Hemisphere might severely affect the phenology of migrating animals, and especially long-distance migrating birds relying on local climatic cues to regulate the timing of migration. We examine the forward displacement of spring in both staging areas and breeding grounds of one such population, the East Atlantic light-bellied brent goose Branta bernicla hrota, and evaluate to what extent their migration has made a proportional response. On the breeding grounds in Svalbard the onset of spring advanced 2 weeks during the 24-year period, whereas no significant trend was found in the temperate staging areas. The timing of migration was constant throughout the study period, mirroring the static climatic conditions in the spring staging areas. These findings indicate a global warming-induced phenological mismatch in light-bellied brent geese, as these might arrive on their breeding grounds well beyond optimal breeding conditions. Our data indicated that productivity was negatively influenced by phenological delay and positively influenced by prolonged snow cover. We argue that both these effects might be representative of a negative influence of the growing phenological mismatch, because years with later thaw might partly offset the effects of increasingly earlier Svalbard springs. During the study period reproduction fell below annual mortality, and the population declined in recent years. The wider implications of these findings may extend to many migrating species, and highlight the urgent need to clarify how global change may influence cues and the associated timing of important life history activities.

There are few analytic tools available to formally integrate information coming from population surveys and demographic studies. The Kalman filter is a procedure that facilitates such integration. Based on a state-space model, we can obtain a likelihood function for the survey data using a Kalman filter, which we may then combine with a likelihood for the demographic data. In this paper, we used this combined approach to analyze the population dynamics of a hunted species, the Greater Snow Goose (Chen caerulescens atlantica), and to examine the extent to which it can improve previous demographic population models. The state equation of the state-space model was a matrix population model with fecundity and regression parameters relating adult survival and harvest rate estimated in a previous capture-recapture study. The observation equation combined the output from this model with estimates from an annual spring photographic survey of the population. The maximum likelihood estimates of the regression parameters from the combined analysis differed little from the values of the original capture-recapture analysis, though their precision improved. The model output was found to be insensitive to a wide range of coefficient of variation (CV) in fecundity parameters. We found a close match between the surveyed and smoothed population size estimates generated by the Kalman filter over an 18-year period, and the estimated CV of the survey (0.078-0.150) was quite compatible with its assumed value (approximately 0.10). When we used the updated parameter values to predict future population size, the model underestimated the surveyed population size by 18% over a three-year period. However, this could be explained by a concurrent change in the survey method. We conclude that the Kalman filter is a promising approach to forecast population change because it incorporates survey information in a formal way compared with ad hoc approaches that either neglect this information or require some parameter or model tuning.

The EST sequence of goose (Anser cygnoides) Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1(SCD-1) was obtained from a subtractive cDNA library. To further investigate the role of SCD-1 in lipid metabolism in geese, 5'-RACE and 3'-RACE were carried out in this study to obtain the complete cDNA sequence of goose SCD-1, which contained a 29-bp 5' UTR, a 1074-bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding 357 amino acids, and a 125-bp 3' UTR. The expression of SCD-1 was measured in several tissues, and the effects of overfeeding on the expression of SCD-1 were studied. The results of real time RT-PCR demonstrated that, compared to the brain, goose SCD-1 mRNA was more abundant in the liver. Overfeeding markedly increased the mRNA expression of SCD-1 in the liver of Sichuan White and Landes geese, and gene expression was markedly higher in the Sichuan White goose than in the landes goose. The mRNA abundance of SCD-1 in the liver had significant positive correlations with triacylglycerol (TG) content in liver lipids and in the levels of plasma insulin and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) levels in Sichuan white geese. However, the mRNA abundance of SCD-1 in the livers of Landes geese had only significant positive correlations with the TG content in liver lipids. In conclusion, SCD-1 is not only critical for hepatic steatosis in geese but is also important for the difference in lipid deposition in the livers of the two breeds.

The purpose of this study was to determine the location of neuronal cell bodies with projections to the cervical or lumbar spinal cord in the adult duck and goose. Bilateral or unilateral injections (5-10 microliter) of the retrograde tracer dye True Blue (TB:5%) were made into the high cervical or high lumbar levels of the spinal cord. Similar results were obtained in both species. First, we found no evidence of retrogradely labelled cells in the telencephalon. In the brainstem, the distribution of TB cells was similar to those previously reported for the pigeon; however, the present study now demonstrates that some of these descending pathways project as far as the lumbar cord. We also discovered that there is a topographical representation of spinal projecting neurons within the avian medullary-pontine reticular formation.

In order to evaluate the expression profile of follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) mRNA in the ovary of Zi geese during developmental and egg laying stages, the expression levels of FSHR mRNA in the ovary of Zi geese at the ages of 1 day, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 8 months (n=8, respectively) were examined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The results showed that FSHR mRNA expression was greater at the age of 1 to 5 and 8 months compared to expression at day 1 (P < 0.05). Particularly, the expression of FSHR mRNA at 4, 5 and 8 months was much greater, 1.86 +/- 0.14, 3.50 +/- 0.19 and 5.11 +/- 0.27 fold, respectively, compared to expression at day 1 (P < 0.01). The level of FSHR mRNA expression at 1, 2 and 3 months was 1.35 +/- 0.12, 1.31 +/- 0.05 and 1.28 +/- 0.09 fold greater, respectively, compared to day 1 (P < 0.05). The results indicate that the expression of FSHR mRNA remains at a stable level during the early developmental stage, and increases initially from 4 months until the egg laying stage. In addition, these results support the possibility that FSHR plays a pivotal role in mediating the response of the goose ovary to follicle-stimulating hormone during the developmental and egg laying stages, and especially during the latter.

The present work is concerned with the study of myosin fractions prepared from the hatching muscle (m. complexus) and a control muscle (m. pectoralis) of the developing goose embryo. The m. complexus attained its maximum mass at hatching and in the 4-day-old bird the mass of this muscle was only one fourth of that recorded at hatching. The m. complexus was hypertrophied already on the 21st day. At days 21, 27 and 28 of incubation and at posthatching days myosin preparations were made from both muscles. Partial purification of myosins from both sources yielded a high molecular weight fraction characteristic of the adult bird and one other protein fraction with molecular mass half of myosin. Both preparations exhibited the characteristic properties of myosin. The lower molecular weight fraction was also shown to develop filamentous aggregates as did the higher molecular-weight, gel filtrated myosin. The phosphate content of the half molecular mass myosin fraction prepared from the embryonic m. complexus at days prior to hatching was considerably higher than that of the high molecular weight fraction and the predominant component was P-Arg. Since the embryonic myosin was still not available in the m. complexus of the 4-day-old birds and the hypertrophied muscle underwent regression after hatching it appears that this myosin fraction is actively involved in breaking through the shell during the hatching period in geese.

This study has aimed at observing in detail the degree of complexity in the formation of the ophthalmic rete in geese living at high altitudes and very cold climate conditions in Kars and its province of Turkey. The 15 adult geese were injected with red and blue coloured latex, dissection was performed, the rete was examined, and the vessels were counted macroscopically and by stereoscopic microscopy. The size and the afferent and efferent vessels of the rete were mostly in parallel with the literature. The numbers of the vessels in the rete of the male and female geese were between 8.3 +/- 1.1 and 9.3 +/- 1.1 in arteries, and 8.6 +/- 1.4 and 10.5 +/- 1.3 in veins respectively. The results suggest that the ophthalmic rete in the goose living at high altitudes and very cold conditions may tend to be less complex, which might be the result of the relatively less cooling needs of the brain at cold conditions.

Studies in a multitude of taxa have described a correlation between heterozygosity and fitness and usually conclude that this is evidence for inbreeding depression. Here, we have used multilocus heterozygosity (MLH) estimates from 15 microsatellite markers to show evidence of heterozygosity-fitness correlations (HFCs) in a long-distance migratory bird, the light-bellied Brent goose. We found significant, positive heterozygosity-heterozygosity correlations between random subsets of the markers we employed, and no evidence that a model containing all loci as individual predictors in a multiple regression explained significantly more variation than a model with MLH as a single predictor. Collectively, these results lend support to the hypothesis that the HFCs we have observed are a function of inbreeding depression. However, we do find that fitness correlations are only detectable in years where population-level productivity is high enough for the reproductive asymmetry between high and low heterozygosity individuals to become apparent. We suggest that lack of evidence of heterozygosity-fitness correlations in animal systems may be because heterozygosity is a poor proxy measure of inbreeding, especially when employing low numbers of markers, but alternatively because the asymmetries between individuals of different heterozygosities may only be apparent when environmental effects on fitness are less pronounced.

Understanding how climate change will affect animal population dynamics remains a major challenge, especially in long-distant migrants exposed to different climatic regimes throughout their annual cycle. We evaluated the effect of temperature throughout the annual cycle on demographic parameters (age-specific survival and recruitment, breeding propensity and fecundity) of the greater snow goose (Chen caerulescens atlantica L.), an arctic-nesting species. As this is a hunted species, we used the theory of exploited populations to estimate hunting mortality separately from natural mortality in order to evaluate climatic effects only on the latter form of mortality. Our analysis was based on a 22-year marking study (n = 27,150 females) and included live recaptures at the breeding colony and dead recoveries from hunters. We tested the effect of climatic covariates by applying a procedure that accounts for unexplained environmental variation in the demographic parameter to a multistate capture-mark-recapture recruitment model. Breeding propensity, clutch size and hatching probability all increased with high temperatures on the breeding grounds. First-year survival to natural causes of mortality increased when temperature was high at the end of the summer, whereas adult survival was not affected by temperature. On the contrary, accession to reproduction decreased with warmer climatic conditions during the non-breeding season. Survival was strongly negatively related to hunting mortality in adults, as expected, but not in first-year birds, which suggests the possibility of compensation between natural and hunting mortality in the latter group. We show that events occurring both at and away from the breeding ground can affect the demography of migratory birds, either directly or through carryover effects, and sometimes in opposite ways. This highlights the need to account for the whole life cycle of an animal when attempting to project the response of populations to future climatic changes.

This study was conducted to investigate the effects of feeding regimens and dietary Trp levels on protein metabolism and regulation of the related gene expression in Yangzhou goslings. A 2 × 3 factorial completely randomized experiment was applied, and the treatments were designed as 2 feeding regimens (ad libitum vs. restricted feeding), and each contained 3 levels of Trp (low-Trp group, 0.14%; medium-Trp group, 0.22%; high-Trp group, 0.30%). The results show that ADG and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were significantly affected by feeding regimens (P < 0.05); dietary Trp levels influenced ADG and ADFI in the starter and overall period (P < 0.05), and interactions between Trp levels and feeding regimens on ADG, ADFI, and FCR were observed in different growing periods (P < 0.05). Serum total protein, triglycerides, and total cholesterol levels in the ad libitum group were higher than those in the restricted feeding group (P < 0.05), and the concentration of serum total protein, glucose, and insulin-like growth factor-I were higher in the medium-Trp and high-Trp groups (P < 0.05); however, serum uric acid, triglyceride, and cortisol levels were reduced in the high-Trp group (P < 0.05). Feeding regimen and dietary Trp levels affected serum glucose (P < 0.05) interactively. In the ad libitum group, tryptophanyl tRNA synthetase (TTS) mRNA expressed at a higher level in the high-Trp treatment, whereas expression of poultry target of rapamycin (pTOR) and p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase1 (S6K1) mRNA was upregulated in the low-Trp treatment (P < 0.05). Expression and phosphorylation levels of pTOR were upregulated in thigh tissue with increased dietary Trp, but cathepsin B and 20S protease mRNA expression decreased (P < 0.05). It was concluded that the protein deposition in gosling thigh tissue was affected by dietary Trp through positive regulation of the TTS mRNA and pTOR protein expression and phosphorylation levels for protein synthesis, as well as the suppression of protein degradation-related gene expression.

Steroid hormones play major roles in the organization of the phenotype and in the activation of behavior. From hatching to fledging, they are involved in growth, development, and learning. We investigated the relationship between the ontogenetic patterns of steroid hormones and the sexual and social development of greylag goslings (Anser anser). Two groups of individually marked goslings (n = 10/5) were hand-raised under near-field conditions. 17beta-OH-androgen (AM), estrogen (EM), and corticosterone (BM) immunoreactive metabolites were measured noninvasively by enzyme immunoassay of individual fecal samples. Feces were regularly sampled from hatching to fledging. All excreted steroids were found to peak at hatching and to decrease thereafter. Gonadal steroids fluctuated more than BM, which remained at low levels throughout ontogeny after a slow decrease during the first 20 days. The pattern of BM is discussed in relation to learning processes (i.e., filial imprinting) and social stress. It is suggested that high initial BM may constrain energy allocation to growth. AM increased around the age of 20 days, when the feathers start growing, and later, together with EM, at the age of 40 days. These elevated values of gonadal steroids are discussed in relation to the sensitive phase of sexual imprinting. Females show higher EM levels than males throughout ontogeny. Furthermore, the ratio of excreted estrogen to androgen (EM/AM) of females before fledging correlates with the number of hatched and fledged goslings in their first years of reproduction. In conclusion, our data suggest a role for steroid hormones in the modulation of behavioral and morphological development in the precocial greylag geese, in agreement with the organizational-activational hypothesis.

The aim was to investigate the effects of yeast selenium (YS) supplementation on the growth performance, meat quality, immunity, and antioxidant variables of geese. A total of 96 one-day-old geese with similar body weight were randomly divided into four groups, with three replicates per group and eight geese in each replicate. The birds were fed basal diets supplemented with 0, 0.10, 0.30, 0.50 mg/kg YS (on selenium basis) during the 63-day experiment. Yeast selenium supplementation showed no effect on the growth performance of geese, but significantly improved the meat quality. No changes in ash or fat content were observed in breast muscle, but significant (p < 0.05) protein content increase was detected in the 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg groups. Yeast selenium supplementation significantly (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) promoted Se deposition in liver, kidney, pancreas, and muscle and the highest increases were all detected in the 0.5 mg/kg group. Yeast selenium supplementation enhanced the organ and cellular immunity of geese, but did not alter the humoral immunity. Furthermore, dietary YS significantly (p < 0.05) promoted the antioxidant capacity of both muscle and liver, but the effects varied with YS levels and organs. Hence, dietary YS supplementation was a good measure to improve the meat quality, Se content, immunity function, and antioxidant capacity of goose.

To explain the preference of wintering greylag geese Anser anser for small Scirpus maritimus tubers (<10mm) over larger ones, our hypothesis was that the former would provide higher intake rates. This 'consumption rate hypothesis' was tested experimentally by deriving the functional responses of geese feeding on tubers of three contrasting sizes. Goose consumption rates were measured as: (i) feeding rate (tubers/min) and (ii) instantaneous intake rate (g fresh weight/min) on various tuber densities (5-200 tubers/tray). Geese had linear functional responses over the range of tuber densities offered, and tuber size affected their consumption rate. The results were then used to re-examine intake rates according to relative biomass of tubers found in the wild. In support of our hypothesis, the larger tubers allowed the lower intake rates. Foraging mechanisms that possibly control the tuber ingestion rate of geese were explored. After controlling (through chemical analyses) that nutritional components of tubers do not differ between sizes, it was concluded that geese preference is mainly due to size-related constraints (i.e. handling time) on their ingestion rates. Additional limiting factors (tuber extraction, digestion capacity) which are likely to constrain food intake of wild geese are also discussed.

1. The apparent and true metabolisable energy values of carob pods meal for geese were measured to be 6.1 MJ/kg and 6.6 MJ/kg respectively. 2. Performance from 5 to 12 weeks was examined in geese fed on four diets containing 0, 100, 200 and 300 g/kg of carob pods meal. 3. The inclusion of carob pods meal up to 200 g/kg in geese diets did not affect the performance. 4. At 300 g/kg performance was highly depressed. 5. The digestibility of protein in the diets decreased linearly with an increase in the level of inclusion of carob pods meal. 6. The length of small intestine, large intestine and caeca and the weight of gizzard expressed per kg of body weight increased with an increase in the level of carob pods meal, which is rich in fibre, in the diets.

Over the last decade, interest in animal flight has grown, in part due to the possible use of flapping propulsion for micro air vehicles. The importance of unsteady lift-enhancing mechanisms in insect flight has been recognized, but unsteady effects were generally thought to be absent for the flapping flight of larger animals. Only recently has the existence of LEVs (leading edge vortices) in small vertebrates such as swifts, small bats and hummingbirds been confirmed. To study the relevance of unsteady effects at the scale of large birds [reduced frequency k between 0.05 and 0.3, k=(pifc)/U(infinity); f is wingbeat frequency, U(infinity) is free-stream velocity, and c is the average wing chord], and the consequences of the lack of kinematic and morphological refinements, we have designed a simplified goose-sized flapping model for wind tunnel testing. The 2-D flow patterns along the wing span were quantitatively visualized using particle image velocimetry (PIV), and a three-component balance was used to measure the forces generated by the wings. The flow visualization on the wing showed the appearance of LEVs, which is typically associated with a delayed stall effect, and the transition into flow separation. Also, the influence of the delayed stall and flow separation was clearly visible in measurements of instantaneous net force over the wingbeat cycle. Here, we show that, even at reduced frequencies as low as those of large bird flight, unsteady effects are present and non-negligible and have to be addressed by kinematic and morphological adaptations.

Sequence variation of the mtDNA (D loop) control region was examined in greater white-fronted goose Anser albifrons Scopoli, 1769 individuals (n = 71). The obtained sequences were compared with those from the NCBI GenBank database. The high level of similarity of the sample from Primorye (A. albifrons) with the sample from Japan (A. a. frontalis) at the level of molecular variation, genetic distance, phylogenetic reconstruction, and haplotype network was demonstrated. A hypothesis on the ways of spring goose migration in the Far East was made. It was confirmed that white-fronted geese wintering in Japan fly to their breeding grounds through Kamchatka.

The experimental materials comprised White Italian geese (128 males and 128 females) reared to 14 wk of age. The birds were fed standard diets ad libitum. Starting from 2 wk of age, 14 males and 14 females were killed at 2-wk intervals. The carcasses were divided into neck, wings, legs, breast, and back, which were then dissected into muscle, skin with fat, and bones. Before slaughter, the BW of males and females were 6,814 and 5,736 g, respectively. At 2 wk of age, more than half of total muscle content was in the legs (60.98%), and the rest was in the back (17.84%), neck (9.43%), breast (8.78%), and wings (2.97%). To 10 wk of age, the rate of muscle deposition was relatively slow in the legs (a decrease to 31.29%) and fast in the breast and wings (an increase to 34.12 and 12.90%, respectively). Age-related changes in the distribution of skin with fat in the carcass were smaller, compared with changes in muscle distribution. A rising tendency was observed in the muscle content of wings and breast and in the content of skin with fat in the wings and neck, whereas a falling tendency was observed in the other carcass parts. Over the first 8 wk, the proportion of bones decreased in the legs, back, and neck and increased in the wings and breast, as compared with the total bone weight in the carcass.

In the present study, the antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii in 191 farm-bred and 83 house-bred geese (Anser domestica) were assessed for the prevalence of T. gondii infection in southern China with the modified agglutination test. Antibodies to T. gondii (MAT ≥ 1 : 5) were found in 27 (14.14%) of farm-bred geese and 14 (16.87%) of house-bred geese. Geese infected with T. gondii may be a source of T. gondii infection for humans and cats.

Barnacle geese were walked on a treadmill at speeds ranging from 0.25 to 1.25 ms(-1), which was their highest sustainable speed. No evidence for a gait change was found. The gait of a barnacle goose appears to conform to the classical pendulum mechanics based model of walking, with the kinetic energy of forward motion (horizontal kinetic energy, E(kh)) out-of-phase with the sum of the gravitational potential (E(p)), and vertical kinetic (E(kv)) energies of the centre of mass at all speeds. Why barnacle geese are unable to aerial run when other 'waddling' species do show an aerial phase (e.g., mallard ducks) is unclear. Presumably, however, it is likely to relate to the amount of lateral kinetic energy generated, which is a feature of 'waddling'. We predict that lateral kinetic energy generated by barnacle geese and other waddling species that cannot aerial run, is higher than in those that can. Due to competing selection pressures for swimming and flight, barnacle geese are mechanically and energetically inefficient walkers relative to more specialist cursorial birds. Their upper walking speed, however, appears to be limited by morphology (via kinematics) and not metabolic capacity (energetics).

In birds, downy feather quantity mainly affected by the follicles. Wnt6, a secreted cysteine-rich protein, plays a key role in follicular development as an intercellular signaling molecule. The present study was to investigate the follicle development and Wnt6 polymorphism in Wanxi-white geese, a Chinese indigenous breed. In total, 300 fertilized eggs were hatched. At embryonic stage and on early birth goslings, the diameter and density of follicles from different sites were examined after sectioning and staining. The results showed that the diameter of primary feather follicles in thorax, venter, dorsum and flank had no difference at embryonic stage. In contrast, after birth, thorax and ventral feather follicles had greater diameter than those on dorsum and flank. Similarly, the primary feather follicle density was higher in thorax and venter than in dorsum and flank at embryonic stage. The secondary feather follicle diameter in flank was greater than that in other sites examined. The secondary follicle showed lush growth in E27 with thickest in ventral and thorax. Overall, follicle formed consistently in dorsal and flank, and follicle in thorax and ventral formed in another consistent way. The polymorphism study showed 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms of Wnt6 and 3 genotypes identified. Sequencing revealed two nucleotide transitions, T451C and A466G, which were synonymous mutations causing codons for aspartate and lysine to change from GAU to GAC and from AAA to AAG, respectively. This information about follicle development and Wnt6 polymorphisms would provide potential utilization in marker-assisted selection program for down feather selection.

Preflight development of the goslings was typified by rapid increases in the mitochondrial enzymes of the semimembranosus and heart ventricular muscles resulting in near-adult values by 3 wk of age. In contrast, aerobic capacity of the pectoralis muscle initially developed slowly but showed a rapid increase between 5 and 7 wk of age, in preparation for becoming airborne. Activities of glycolytic enzymes in the pectoralis muscle showed similar patterns of development as those found for the aerobic enzymes, except for hexokinase, which was low at all ages, indicating an adaptation for catabolism of both intracellular glycogen and plasma fatty acids in preference to plasma glucose. Muscle mass specific activity of citrate synthase in the pectoralis increased by only 33% from goslings during the first few days of flight, compared with premigratory geese. Activities of anaerobic glycolytic enzymes in the ventricles were low, but values for hexokinase, which is involved in the phosphorylation of plasma glucose, developed rapidly. Values for lactate dehydrogenase were also high, reflecting the capacity of the heart to catabolize plasma lactate. Substrate flux supplied by carnitine palmitoyltransferase and oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGD), in the pectoralis muscles of the premigratory geese, appears to have the smallest excess capacities to meet the requirements of sustained aerobic flight. The average maximum oxygen uptake for premigratory geese during flight, as indicated by values for OGD, is calculated to be 484 ml O2/min (or 208 ml O2.min-1.kg-1).

The bar-headed goose, a specialized high-altitude species, has a capacity for high oxygen uptake from a hypoxic environment. It thus has a higher oxygen affinity than other bird species of lower-altitude environments. Oxygen affinity is determined by molecular structures and genetic mutations of hemoglobin (Hb), which can also influence the coordinating structures and dynamics of oxygen-Hb. To explore the structural differences in Hbs as between high and low altitude species, photolysis dynamic parameters, including quantum yield, enthalpy, and conformational volume changes in carboxy-Hbs (HbCO) for the bar-headed goose and low altitude counterparts (the Chinese goose and chicken) were investigated by the laser pumping-probing technique and photoacoustic calorimetry. Comparing the photolysis results for HbCO of the three species, the enthalpy and conformational volume changes of the bar-headed goose were much smaller than those of the others, although the quantum yields of all three species are similar. To explain the possible mechanisms of these differences, modifications of salt bridges and key residue mutations at the α β subunit interfaces of the proteins are described and discussed briefly.

Climate change affects the distribution and persistence of wildlife. Broad scale studies have demonstrated that climate change shifts the geographic ranges and phenology of species. These findings are influential for making high level strategies but not practical enough to guide site specific management. In this study, we explored the environment factors affecting the population of Bar-headed Goose in the key breeding site of Qinghai using generalized additive mixed model (GAMM). Our results showed that 1) there were significant increasing trends in climate variables and river flows to the Qinghai Lake; 2) NDVI in the sites decreased significantly despite the regional positive trend induced by the warmer and wetter climate; 3) NDVI at site scale was negatively correlated to lake water level; and 4) the abundance of Bar-headed Goose decreased significantly at all sites. While the abundance was positively related to NDVI at breeding sites, the GAMM revealed an opposite relationship at foraging areas. Our findings demonstrated the multi-facet effects of climate change on population dynamics; and the effect at global/regional scale could be complicated by site level factors.

1. The growth period is an important determinant of fitness later in life through its effects on first-year survival and future reproduction. Choices by adult females about where to rear their offspring strongly affect growth rates and offspring fitness in geese. 2. Individual female black brent (Branta bernicla nigricans) tend to raise their broods in the same areas each year, and these areas are consistently ranked with respect to growth rates of goslings. Therefore, some females consistently rear their broods on areas resulting in lower post-fledging fitness. 3. We explore the potential that growth rates of offspring (and associated fitness consequences) are traded off against other vital rates influencing fitness of either adult females or goslings. Growth of goslings primarily influences fitness after fledging, so one hypothesis is that survival before fledging, which is influenced by predation, is traded off against growth rates and post-fledging survival. 4. We estimated pre-fledging and post-fledging survival for goslings reared on areas used by broods from the Tutakoke River black brent colony. We examined recaptures, recoveries by hunters and resightings of brent marked as goslings with webtags and standard leg rings. These data were analyzed using capture-mark-recapture models in program mark to derive separate estimates of pre- and post-fledging survival for 18 cohorts (1987-2004) of black brent goslings across seven brood rearing areas (BRAs). 5. Estimates of pre-fledging survival probability varied from 0·00 ± 0·00 (mean ± 95% confidence interval) to 0·92 ± 0·1; and estimates of post-fledging survival probability varied from 0·00 ± 0·00 to 1·00 ± 0·08. Substantial variation existed both among BRAs and years but post-fledging survival declined substantially during the study. 6. Pre- and post-fledging survival were positively correlated, exhibiting a quadratic relationship (ß(post-fledging survival)  = 1·00 (±0·47)x-0·83 (±0·480)x(2) , where x = pre-fledging survival). Therefore, we did not find a trade-off between pre- and post-fledging survival in black brent goslings across BRAs, suggesting that factors other than foraging conditions and predation on goslings must influence selection of BRAs.

A portion of the Goose parvovirus (GPV) genome DNA was cloned, sequenced, and primers for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were prepared. The specificity of the clone was checked by Southern blot hybridization to GPV genome and by in situ hybridization with GPV infected cells. In Muscovy ducklings experimentally infected with the virulent GPV strain IH, the viral genome was detected by PCR on and after 2 days in many tissues including the brain. Using PCR, the primers also detected another GPV strain Ma isolated in Japan.

We tested DNA extraction methods and PCR conditions for the amplification of bryophyte DNA from barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis) faeces collected from Spitsbergen (Svalbard). Both the Qiagen stool kit and a silica-based extraction method received sufficient DNA from fresh and older droppings, as indicated by successful amplification of the plastid psbA-trnH spacer. Standard Taq polymerase outperformed two hot start polymerases. Sequencing of cloned PCR products revealed at least ten moss and two angiosperm sequences. This first example of identifying bryophyte DNA from faeces will allow analysing moss diets of arctic herbivores with a DNA barcoding approach.

Understanding stopover decisions of long-distance migratory birds is crucial for conservation and management of these species along their migratory flyway. Recently, an increasing number of Barnacle geese breeding in the Russian Arctic have delayed their departure from their wintering site in The Netherlands by approximately one month and have reduced their staging duration at stopover sites in the Baltic accordingly. Consequently, this extended stay increases agricultural damage in The Netherlands. Using a dynamic state variable approach we explored three hypotheses about the underlying causes of these changes in migratory behavior, possibly related to changes in (i) onset of spring, (ii) potential intake rates and (iii) predation danger at wintering and stopover sites. Our simulations showed that the observed advance in onset of spring contradicts the observed delay of departure, whereas both increased predation danger and decreased intake rates in the Baltic can explain the delay. Decreased intake rates are expected as a result of increased competition for food in the growing Barnacle goose population. However, the effect of predation danger in the model was particularly strong, and we hypothesize that Barnacle geese avoid Baltic stopover sites as a response to the rapidly increasing number of avian predators in the area. Therefore, danger should be considered as an important factor influencing Barnacle goose migratory behavior, and receive more attention in empirical studies.

This study shows the apparent role of the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) in regulating food intake in the goose. The feeding pattern of normal animals has been compared with that of animals made hyperphagic by destruction of the VMH. Lesioning of the VMH modified the circadian pattern of intake. All the geese tended to equalize their intakes between the light and dark periods. The overall effect of lesioning was considerable hyperphagia resulting from an increase in the number of meals and of their amplitude and duration, as well as in the rate of ingestion. We have emphasized the importance of defining the meal when interpreting changes in the correlations between the amount of food ingested during the meal and the length of pre or postprandial intervals after destruction of the VMH. Although it is important, the fatty liver syndrome induced after hyperphagia is not sufficient to produce fatty livers which can compete with those obtained by traditional cramming.

Demographic links among fragmented populations are commonly studied as source-sink dynamics, whereby source populations exhibit net recruitment and net emigration, while sinks suffer net mortality but enjoy net immigration. It is commonly assumed that large, persistent aggregations of individuals must be sources, but this ignores the possibility that they are sinks instead, buoyed demographically by immigration. We tested this assumption using Bayesian integrated population modelling of Greenland white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons flavirostris) at their largest wintering site (Wexford, Ireland), combining capture-mark-recapture, census and recruitment data collected from 1982 to 2010. Management for this subspecies occurs largely on wintering areas; thus, study of source-sink dynamics of discrete regular wintering units provides unprecedented insights into population regulation and enables identification of likely processes influencing population dynamics at Wexford and among 70 other Greenland white-fronted goose wintering subpopulations. Using results from integrated population modelling, we parameterized an age-structured population projection matrix to determine the contribution of movement rates (emigration and immigration), recruitment and mortality to the dynamics of the Wexford subpopulation. Survival estimates for juvenile and adult birds at Wexford and adult birds elsewhere fluctuated over the 29-year study period, but were not identifiably different. However, per capita recruitment rates at Wexford in later years (post-1995) were identifiably lower than in earlier years (pre-1995). The observed persistence of the Wexford subpopulation was only possible with high rates of immigration, which exceeded emigration in each year. Thus, despite its apparent stability, Wexford has functioned as a sink over the entire study period. These results demonstrate that even large subpopulations can potentially be sinks, and that movement dynamics (e.g. immigration) among winters can dramatically obscure key processes driving subpopulation size. Further, novel population models which integrate capture-mark-recapture, census and recruitment data are essential to correctly ascribing source-sink status and accurately informing development of site-safeguard networks.

In appropriate situations, large populations of geese exhibit dynamical rearrangements by repeated mergers and splits among the groups. We describe the grouping process in terms of a mean-field model based on the Smoluchowski equation of coagulation with fragmentation and observationally plausible kernels. To verify our model, we conducted field observations on skeins of airborne geese, noting both the group-size distribution and the group-forming processes. We found that the group-size distribution we obtained in our field measurements could be represented by a fractional power function with an exponential cutoff. This function matches the asymptotic form of the steady-state solution of our model. Furthermore, we estimated the effective number of individuals involved in interactions by comparison of the model to our field data.

Despite the low similarity between their amino acid sequences, the core structures of the fold between chicken-type and goose-type lysozymes are conserved. However, their enzymatic activities are quite different. Both of them exhibit hydrolytic activities, but the goose-type lysozyme does not exhibit transglycosylation activity. The chicken-type lysozyme has a retaining-type reaction mechanism, while the reaction mechanism of the goose-type lysozyme has not been clarified. To clarify the latter mechanism, goose egg-white lysozyme (GEL)-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc)6 complexes were modelled and compared with hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL)-(GlcNAc)6 complexes. By systematic conformational search, 48 GEL-(GlcNAc)6 complexes were modelled. The right and left side, and the amino acid residues in subsites E-G were identified in GEL. The GlcNAc residue D could bind towards the right side without distortion and there was enough room for a water molecule to attack the C1 carbon of GlcNAc residue D from alpha-side in the right side and not for acceptor molecule. The result of molecular dynamics simulation suggests that GEL would be an inverting enzyme, and Asp97 would act as a second carboxylate and that the narrow space of the binding cleft at subsites E-G in GEL may prohibit the sugar chain to bind alternative site that might be essential for transglycosylation.

Tongue specimens were collected from 18 healthy adult Egyptian geese (Alopochen aegyptiacus) of both sexes. We measured and analyzed the whole, anterior, middle and posterior length and width of the tongue parts. The dorsal mucosal surface of each tongue was investigated by SEM. The length of whole tongue, widths at anterior and middle ends of its root showed significant differences between sexes. By gross morphology, the tongue showed 3 parts (anterior, middle and posterior). The anterior part represented 1 half of the tongue, while the 2 remaining parts comprised the other half. A clear median longitudinal groove was observed macroscopically along the forward half of the anterior region. The caudal part of the body had a central circular depression in front of giant conical papillae arranged in transverse row. On both sides of the tongue, cylindrical lingual papillae were compactly distributed and divided into anterior and posterior groups which increased in size and decreased in number caudally. By SEM, both giant conical and large cylindrical lingual papillae were lined with extensively modified mucosal surfaces that appeared as finger-like projections with scales. The tongue, which plays an important role in food intake in Egyptian geese, exhibited significant morphological variations in dorsal mucosal lining between sexes. Morphological observations recorded significant gender differences in total length and widths of the tongue at anterior and middle segments of its root.

1. The purpose of this work was to test the possibility of increasing the hatchability of goose eggs with low mass specific eggshell gas conductance (Gsp), by drilling holes through the eggshell into the air cell, and thus solving both the low water loss rate and low oxygen availability problems. 2. A linear relationship was found between the area of a hole drilled and the apparent increase in eggshell gas conductance (G). Drilling more than one hole increased apparent G 3-6 times more than one hole only, of the same total area. 3. Hole-drilling did not increase egg contamination. The drilling of a 5 mm2 hole on day 17 of incubation increased hatchability both in laboratory tests and in commercial hatcheries (6.1% and 10.5% respectively). 4. Drilling holes on days 15 to 22 of incubation increased hatchability when the predicted mean water loss was lower than 14%. Drilling on day 25 did not have a significant effect, and drilling on day 11 of incubation was too early. 5. Drilling a hole into the aircell (during the second half of incubation) may increase hatchability of low conductance eggs, although oxygen pressure under the eggshell should then be checked in order to evaluate oxygen availability to the embryo.

The cDNA of goose interferon-alpha (goIFN-alpha) was amplified from PHA stimulated PBMCs of goose by RT-PCR. The cDNA encodes a 30-amino acid signal peptide and a 161-amino acid mature protein, respectively. Recombinant mature goIFN-alpha (rgoIFN-alpha) expressed by prokaryotic and eukaryotic system possessed antiviral activity that was neutralized by rabbit anti-rgoIFN-alpha antibody in vitro. On the other hand, rgoIFN-alpha lacks intrinsic macrophage activating factor (MAF) activity, peripheral blood leukocyte-derived macrophages (PBLMs) could not produce nitric oxide (NO) by stimulate with rgoIFN-alpha as compared to stimulate with recombinant mature goIFN-gamma (rgoIFN-gamma) that was a powerful NO stimulant in vitro.

A dramatic increase in the breeding population of geese has occurred over the past few decades at Svalbard. This may strongly impact the fragile ecosystems of the Arctic tundra because many of the ultra-oligotrophic freshwater systems experience enrichment from goose feces. We surveyed 21 shallow tundra ponds along a gradient of nutrient enrichment based on exposure to geese. Concentrations of total phosphorus (P) and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in the tundra ponds ranged from 2-76 to 2-23 microg l(-1) respectively, yet there was no significant increase in phytoplankton biomass (measured as chlorophyll a; range: 0.6-7.3 microg l(-1)) along the nutrient gradient. This lack of response may be the result of the trophic structure of these ecosystems, which consists of only a two-trophic level food chain with high biomasses of the efficient zooplankton grazer Daphnia in the absence of fish and scarcity of invertebrate predators. Our results indicate that this may cause a highly efficient grazing control of phytoplankton in all ponds, supported by the fact that large fractions of the nutrient pools were bound in zooplankton biomass. The median percentage of Daphnia-N and Daphnia-P content to particulate (sestonic) N and P was 338 and 3009%, respectively, which is extremely high compared to temperate lakes. Our data suggest that Daphnia in shallow arctic ponds is heavily subsidized by major inputs of energy from other food sources (bacteria, benthic biofilm), which may be crucial to the persistence of strong top-down control of pelagic algae by Daphnia.

A follow-up study was performed to describe characteristic physiological alterations by means of computer tomography, direct chemical analysis and histology of the liver, and blood biochemical parameters during conventional force-feeding of Landes geese. 30 birds were exposed to an 18-day long force-feeding. Sampling was performed at the start and during force-feeding (7th, 11th, 14th, 18th days). Computer tomographic data were plotted in 3D histograms, effectively indicating the volumetric development and the fat deposition of the liver. Applying the so-called fat index, a saturation process was found for the hepatic fat content. Histological sections indicated the appearance of microvesicular fat forms in the hepatocyte cytoplasm, which first turned to a total fatty infiltration, later changing to a macrovesicular form with progressing inflammation; membrane damage was not visualized. In blood metabolites triglyceride, total and HDL cholesterol and uric acid increased measurably, while creatinine concentration decreased. Alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase activities increased strongly, while that of lactate dehydrogenase only slightly. Based on the results of macroscopic and microscopic imaging techniques and blood biochemical parameters, a comprehensive follow-up study was performed, elucidating still unknown processes during force-feeding of geese.

Water suppliers have often implicated roosting birds for fecal contamination of their surface waters. Geese and gulls have been the primary targets of this blame although literature documenting the fecal coliform content of these birds is quite limited. To determine the actual fecal coliform concentrations of these birds, fecal samples from 249 ring-billed gulls and 236 Canada geese in Westchester County, N.Y., were analyzed over a 2-year period. Results indicate that gull feces contain a greater average concentration of fecal coliform bacteria per gram (3.68 x 10(8)) than do goose feces (1.53 x 10(4)); however, average fecal sample weights of the geese were more than 15 times higher than those of the gulls.

Body weight is one of the most important traits in any genetic improvement program in geese for at least 2 reasons. First, measurements of the trait are very easy. Second, body weight is correlated with a number of other meat performance traits. However, the genetic background of body weight shows considerable complexity. Three genetic models (with direct, maternal genetic and permanent maternal environmental effects) were employed in this study. Records of 3076 individuals of maternal strain W11 and 2656 individuals of paternal strain W33 over 6 consecutive generations, kept in the pedigree farm of Kołuda Wielka, were analysed. Body weight (in kilograms) was measured in weeks 8 (BW8) and 11 (BW11). The inbreeding levels in both populations were relatively low (0.14% and 0.02% for W11 and W33, respectively), therefore these effects were not included in the linear models to estimate genetic parameters. Three fixed effects (hatch period, sex and year) were included in each linear model. Two criteria (AIC, BIC) were used to check the goodness of fit of the models. The computations were performed by WOMBAT software. In general, the genetic parameter estimates varied across the traits, models and strains studied. Direct additive heritability estimates ranged from 0.0001 (for BW11 of W33) to 0.55 (for BW11 of W33). Maternal and total heritabilities were also variable. Estimates of ratios of direct-maternal effect covariance in phenotypic variance were both positive and negative, but they were negligible, whereas ratios of the permanent environmental maternal variance to phenotypic variance were close to zero. Both of the applied criteria of model adequacy indicate that the model with maternal genetic and environmental effects should be considered as optimal. Genetic trends were close to zero. It seems that they were influenced by long-term selection. Similar tendencies have been observed for phenotypic trends, as well.

1. The goose major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class IIB cDNA (Ancy-MHCII) was cloned by homology cloning and rapid amplification of cDNA ends by polymerase chain reaction (RACE-PCR), and the genomic structure and tissue expression were investigated. 2. Three different 5'-RACE sequences (Ancy-MHC II5'-1, Ancy-MHC II5'-2, Ancy-MHC II5'-3), one 3'-RACE sequence (Ancy-MHC II-3') and two different full length Ancy-MHC IIB cDNA sequences (Ancy-CD01, Ancy-CD02), which came from different alleles at one locus or different loci, were determined. 3. The genomic organisation is composed of 6 exons and 5 introns, with a longer intron region than that of the chicken. The alleles encode 259 and 260 amino acids in the mature protein. 4. The number of non-synonymous substitutions (dN) in the peptide-binding region of exon 2 from 8 alleles was higher than that of the synonymous substitutions (dS). 5. Tissue-specific expression of Ancy-MHC II mRNA was detected in an adult goose using RT-PCR. These results showed that Ancy-MHC II mRNA was expressed in the lung, spleen, liver, intestine, heart, kidney, pancreas, brain, skin and muscle. This is consistent with the expression of MHC class IIB in various tissues from the chicken. 6. Sequences from goose, snipe and duck clustered together when compared with known MHC class IIB sequences from the other species, significantly differing from mammals and aquatic species, indicating a pattern consistent with accepted evolutionary pathways.

The timing of life-cycle events crucially influences fitness, particularly in migratory birds, which visit chains of sites with varying seasonality. Here, we used a proportional hazards model to identify local environmental factors, which a long-distance migrant, the Pink-footed Goose (Anser brachyrhynchus), uses for departure decisions on multiple sites along its spring flyway from Denmark via Norway to Svalbard. Our results not only identified day length, local accumulated temperature, and their interaction as likely candidates, but also (more importantly) showed for the first time that their relevance changes en route. The results suggest that the birds switch on a "migratory program" in their wintering grounds, with day length providing general information on time of the year and integrated temperatures providing information on larger scale climate trends. Thereafter, on the stopover sites, local accumulated temperatures allow the geese to infer information on the advancement of spring, which is then used to adjust the speed of progressing northward.

When differently sized species feed on the same resources, interference competition may occur, which may negatively affect their food intake rate. It is expected that competition between species also alters behaviour and feeding patch selection. To assess these changes in behaviour and patch selection, we applied an experimental approach using captive birds of three differently sized Anatidae species: wigeon (Anas penelope) (~600 g), swan goose (Anser cygnoides) (~2700 g) and bean goose (Anser fabalis) (~3200 g). We quantified the functional response for each species and then recorded their behaviour and patch selection with and without potential competitors, using different species combinations. Our results showed that all three species acquired the highest nitrogen intake at relatively tall swards (6, 9 cm) when foraging in single species flocks in the functional response experiment. Goose species were offered foraging patches differing in sward height with and without competitors, and we tested for the effect of competition on foraging behaviour. The mean percentage of time spent feeding and being vigilant did not change under competition for all species. However, all species utilized strategies that increased their peck rate on patches across different sward heights, resulting in the same instantaneous and nitrogen intake rate. Our results suggest that variation in peck rate over different swards height permits Anatidae herbivores to compensate for the loss of intake under competition, illustrating the importance of behavioural plasticity in heterogeneous environments when competing with other species for resources.

A genomic library of partially EcoRI-digested DNA from the lesser snow goose, Anser caerulescens caerulescens, was constructed in the phage vector Charon 4. Phage containing only unique sequences were identified by screening plaques with 32P-labeled genomic DNA. Restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms (RFLPs) were identified by probing DNA from 11-13 male birds from the breeding colony at La Perouse Bay. Of the 17 probes examined, all detected RFLPs with at least one of EcoRi, HindIII, Msp1, and Taq1. Several of them identified highly variable regions with multiple alleles. These RFLPs are valuable DNA markers that can be used for (1) the examination of DNA variation, relatedness, and genetic distance and (2) assessing paternity and maternity. These data suggest that there are higher levels of variation of DNA sequence in birds than had previously been thought to exist.

We examined body composition in barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) by proximate carcass analysis and by deuterium isotope dilution. We studied the effect of isotope equilibration time on the accuracy of total body water (TBW) estimates and evaluated models to predict fat-free mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM) from different measurements varying in their level of invasiveness. Deuterium enrichment determined at 45, 90, and 180 min after isotope injection did not differ significantly. At all sampling intervals, isotope dilution spaces (TBW(d)) consistently overestimated body water determined by carcass analysis (TBW(c)). However, variance in the deviation from actual TBW was higher at the 45-min sampling interval, whereas variability was the same at 90 and 180 min, indicating that 90 min is sufficient time to allow for adequate equilibration. At 90 min equilibration time, deuterium isotope dilution overestimated TBW(c) by 7.1% +/= 2.6% (P < 0.001, paired t-test, n=20). This overestimate was consistent over the range of TBW studied, and TBW(c) could thus be predicted from TBW(d) (r2=0.976, P<0.001). Variation in TBW(c) and TBW(d) explained, respectively, 99% and 98% of the variation in FFM. FM could be predicted with a relative error of ca. 10% from TBW estimates in combination with body mass (BM). In contrast, BM and external body measurements allowed only poor prediction. Abdominal fat fresh mass was highly correlated to total FM and, if the carcass is available, allows simple means of fat prediction without dissecting the entire specimen.

For a number of decades, the lesser white-fronted goose (Anser erythropus) has been almost-absent from the Fennoscandian fauna and has a current population size of only about 60 breeding pairs, with fewer than 10 pairs in Sweden. During the period 1981-1991 more than 200 young have been reintroduced in northern Sweden. However, the origin and possible relatedness of lesser white-fronted individuals were unknown when the breeding program started. We have used DNA fingerprinting to assess the similarity of 18 individuals, i.e., the entire captive population used for breeding in 1991 and about 60% of the captive population used in 1981-1991. Minisatellite probe 33.15 provided an index for an average similarity of 0.39 between the mates of the 12 breeding pairs used for producing offspring for reintroduction. This is a higher similarity than in natural populations of birds in general but lower than in populations that have passed through serious population bottlenecks. Individuals originating from different breeders are more dissimilar than those from the same breeder. However, the close relationships (similarity, 0.5-0.6) found in a group of five individuals from different breeders show that selecting individuals from different breeding groups is not sufficient to prevent mating between closely related individuals.

Environmental conditions at one point of the annual cycle of migratory species may lead to cross-seasonal effects affecting fitness in subsequent seasons. Based on a long-term mark-resighting dataset and scoring of body condition in an arctic breeding goose species, we demonstrate a substantial effect of winter harshness on post-winter body condition. However, this effect was compensated along the spring migration corridor, and did not persist long enough to influence future reproduction. This highlights the importance of temporal scale when assessing impacts of environmental effects, and suggests a state-dependent physiological mechanism adjusting energy accumulation according to internal energy stores carried into spring. In support of these findings, the development of body condition was unaffected by whether geese used supplementary feeding sites or not. While there was no effect of winter harshness on the average population pre-breeding body condition, individual variations in early spring body condition (probably related to different life-histories) were partly traceable throughout spring. This strongly indicates a carry-over effect on the individual level, possibly related to differences in dominance, site use, disturbance or migration strategy, which may potentially affect future reproduction.

Rearing experiments were conducted with a total of 90 liver hybrid geese from Babat, divided into three groups of 30 birds each. The effect exerted by all-concentrate feeding (group 1), concentrate feeding supplemented with alfalfa hay (group 2) or with corn silage (group 3) ad libitum on the blood glucose level, blood plasma total lipid, total cholesterol and free fatty acid level, and on total lipid content of the liver was studied. In addition, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity of the blood plasma and carotene, vitamin A and vitamin E concentration of the blood plasma and the liver were determined. It was found that the blood and liver parameters of goose groups fed different diets changed within the physiological limits typical of the species. Excessive fibre intake resulted in reduced lipid transport within the organism at an unchanged plasma cholesterol level; at the same time, blood glucose level remained unchanged. Ad libitum feeding of alfalfa hay and corn silage enhanced carotene and vitamin A transport and carotene storage but did not affect the transport of vitamin E. The results confirm earlier data of the literature that beta-carotene and vitamin A together impair vitamin E metabolism.

In studying the roles of prolactin in regulation of seasonal reproduction, incubation, broodiness and laying performance in goose, the goose PRL gene was cloned in Magang goose. The goose PRL cDNA shared 98.4%, 92.2%, 92%, and 91.9% sequence homology to duck, turkey, chicken and quail PRLs, respectively. The goose PRL gene consisted of 5 exons and 4 introns, just as in other species. The 5' proximal regulatory region shared high homology with those in other avian species as well, and, apart from other non-specific transcription factor binding sites, contained 2 regulatory element binding sites, a Pit-1 (-130/-122) and a VIP response element (-64/-53). The deduced 199-residue mature goose PRL shared 98.5%, 94%, 93%, and 92% homology to duck, quail, chicken, and turkey PRLs, respectively. When compared with other vertebrates, all residues were found to be highly conserved at the key positions in the 4 conserved domains (PD1-PD4), including the 6 cysteine residues at positions 4, 11, 58, 175, 191, and 199. The only exception was a substitution of Arginine by Histidine at position 176 in the mature PRL peptide. These findings render goose PRL as having a similar hydropathy profile and similar secondary and tertiary structures with other PRLs. Goose PRL also possesses an N-linked glycosylation site (Asn-X-Ser), at position 6, and an alternative glycosylation site (Asn-Gly-Cys), at position 56. Five PRL isoforms were detected in goose, as well as in chicken pituitary glands, by immunoblotting analysis. Results of this study not only provided a starting point for further study of PRL function, synthesis, and secretion in goose species, but also for breeding new goose lines efficiently using the genomic information.

1. One hundred and twenty geese were slaughtered in groups of 10 at weekly intervals from 1-d-old until 71 d and also at 114 d and were subjected to carcase analysis. 2. The reduction in the proportion of low-value parts of the body in the period from the first to 114th d after hatching was 16.4 and 17.3% for males and females, respectively. 3. The relative proportion of weight of legs declined both with age and with body weight increase. It was described by a linear function in males and by a power function in females. 4. The relative proportion of wing weight increased from 1.2 and 1.3% on the first day after hatching in males and females, respectively, to 16.6% at the age of 50 d, and 15.2% at the age of 43 d in males and females, respectively.

Blood samples from a total of 44 geese of the Hungarian breed, representing three age groups (3 months old, 6 months old, and adult) and originating from the Babat Goose Farm, were examined for packed cell volume (PCV), differential count, haemoglobin content, and serum levels of glucose, total protein, total lipid, calcium and phosphorus. The results revealed significant age-related variations in PCV, proportions of lymphocytes and eosinophils, total protein, total lipid, calcium and phosphorus. The changes were comparable to those obtained for 3 months old and adult Landes geese.

In order to understand the variations of genomic organization of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and provide data for the studies on disease resistance of avian species, the MHC class II polymorphism in Chinese Z-goose was investigated for the first time in the present study. Eight alleles, which probably came from different loci, were found in six different geese with only one obvious band in the restriction fragment length polymorphism data. The numbers of nonsynonymous substitutions (dN) in peptide binding region of exon 2 were higher than that of synonymous substitutions (dS), and no stop codons or frameshift mutations were found in this region, indicating that balance selection was in operation, and the sequences are not likely to be pseudogenes. In addition, we successfully obtained five different long MHC class II fragments (about 1,162 bp) in six geese and found that the length of intron 1 was longer than that in chicken and some other birds, but intron 2 seemed to be intermediate in length. The phylogenetic tree appeared to branch in an order consistent with accepted evolutionary pathway.

Two species of waterfowl living at high altitude provide a prominent example of parallel adaptation at the molecular level. The bar-headed goose (Anser indicus) breeds at high elevations in central Asia and migrates across the Himalayas, where the partial pressure of oxygen (O(2)) is one-third of sea level. In South America, the distantly related Andean goose (Chloephaga melanoptera) is endemic to the high Andes. Both species exhibit increased blood-O(2) affinity, which has been attributed to the effects of single amino acid substitutions in the major hemoglobin. Here we present phylogenetic analyses of the swans and geese (Anserinae) and South American sheldgeese (Anatinae) using the three genes that encode the major (HbA) and minor (HbD) hemoglobin isoforms. We sought to determine whether two amino acid substitutions that have been the focus of extensive biochemical analysis (Ala-alpha(A)119 and Ser-beta(A)55) are uniquely derived in bar-headed goose and Andean goose, respectively, and to examine evidence of molecular adaptation at other positions in hemoglobin genes by comparing these two high-altitude taxa to their closest relatives. Bayesian analysis of the alpha(A)-, alpha(D)-, and beta(A)-subunit genes produced well-resolved phylogenies, with high posterior probabilities and bootstrap values for most genera. The bar-headed goose is likely sister to all other Anser species. Andean goose, the sole highland representative of the South American sheldgeese is either sister to the other Chloephaga species or sister to Neochen. In the bar-headed goose, four derived substitutions were observed in HbA (alpha(A)12, 18, 63, 119) and two in HbD (alpha(D)2, 47). Four derived substitutions in Andean goose include three in HbA (alpha(A)8, 77; beta(A)86) and two in HbD (alpha(D)9; beta(A)86). Considering both highland species, four substitutions (Ala-alpha(A)8, Ala-alpha(A)12, Ser-alpha(A)18, Leu-alpha(D)9) were located at adjacent positions on the A helix (or AB corner) of the alpha-chains, three others (Thr-alpha(A)77, Ser-beta(A)86, Ser-alpha(D)2) were in close proximity to inositolpentaphosphate (IP(5)) binding sites, and Ala-alpha(A)119 occurred at an alphabeta intersubunit contact. Ser-beta(A)55, which is involved in the same alphabeta intersubunit contact and was previously shown to increase Hb-O(2) affinity, is not unique to Andean goose, but is a synapomorphy of the South American sheldgeese, a clade of predominantly lowland waterfowl. Our findings illustrate the importance of understanding phylogenetic relationships and polarity of character-state changes when making inferences about adaptive evolution.

We used stochastic dynamic programming to investigate a spectacular migration strategy in the black brant Branta bernicla nigricans, a species of goose. Black brant migration is well suited for theoretical analysis since there are a number of existing strategies that easily can be compared. In early autumn, almost the entire population of the black brant gathers at Izembek Lagoon on the Alaska Peninsula to stage and refuel before the southward migration. There are at least three distinct strategies, with most geese making a spectacular direct migration more than 5000km across the Gulf of Alaska to their wintering grounds in southern Baja California or mainland Mexico. This is a potentially dangerous strategy since foraging is not possible during the overseas passage. Some individuals instead use shorter flights to make a detour along the coast, a longer route that all individuals use for northwards migration in spring. Since flight costs accelerate with increasing body mass, migration by short flights is energetically cheaper than long-distance flights. A small but increasing part of the population has recently begun to winter at Izembek. We investigated this migration under two different suppositions using a dynamic state variable model. First, if the geese are free to make a strategic choice, under what assumptions should they prefer direct migration and under what assumptions should they prefer detour migration/winter residency? Second, provided that the dominating direct migration strategy is optimal, what conditions will force the geese to go for detour migration/winter residency? In the second case the geese may try to follow an optimal direct migration strategy, but stochastic events may force them to choose a suboptimal policy. We also simulated possible effects of global warming. The model suggests that the fuel level at arrival in Izembek and fuel gain rates are key factors and that tail winds must have been reliable in the past, otherwise direct migration could not have evolved. It also suggests that a change to milder winters may promote an unexpectedly abrupt change from long-distance to short-distance migration or winter residency. Finally, it produced a number of predictions that might be testable in the field.

The bronchial arteries arose from the oesophagotracheobronchial branches of the common carotid arteries. In the goose, duck, Muscovy duck, and turkey several small bronchial arteries supplied the whole length of each primary bronchus, including the orifices of the secondary bronchi. In the guinea-fowl and quail similar bronchial arteries supplied only the extrapulmonary part of the primary bronchus. In the pigeon a single true bronchial artery supplied the extrapulmonary part of each primary bronchus; this pair of bronchial arteries arose asymmetrically from a common bronchial trunk derived from the left oesophagotracheobronchial artery only. In this species, and in the guinea-fowl and quail, the intrapulmonary part of the primary bronchus was supplied by the pulmonary artery. There were no branches to the exchange tissue in any species. In all species the bronchial veins of the extra-pulmonary part of the primary bronchus drained via oesophageal veins, whereas those of the intrapulmonary part emptied into branches of the pulmonary vein.

In 5 trials using a total of 5,7000 geese (Deutsche Legegans maleXWhite Italian Goose female) of which 482 were slaughtered and subsequently dressed, the influence of varying net energy and crude protein levels in the ration on fattening and carcass performance were studied. Increased crude protein contents were found to improve the meat yield. High-energy feeding likewise caused gains to go up, the extra gain almost exclusively consisting in adipose tissue (particularly skin, and intestinal and abdominal fat). In addition, high energy intakes induced earlier juvenile moulting, this effect making the 56-day old carcasses rather bristly. Therefore, it seems more convenient to fatten geese on low-energy rations (500 energetic feed equivalents/poultry [EFp] per kg) up to the age of 63 days because the meat yield (especially of breast meat) is likely to improve considerably when slaughter takes place at a later date. Goose fattening rations should stick to the following parameters (per kg): 500--550 EFp, 160--180 g crude protein, 8 g lysine, 6.5 g thio-amino acids.

The general development of the tongue in birds was described by Lillie (1908) in chicken. Bryk et al. (1992) also studied the tongue development in chicken and they observed development of the conical papillae of the body. Our study aims to describe the timing of the development of the tongue morphological features in the domestic goose by using SEM methods. The tongue of the domestic goose is characterized by the widest variety of shape of the particular part of the tongue and mechanical papillae. Results indicated that the formation of the apex, body, lingual prominence, and the root of the tongue take place between the 10th and 19th day of incubation. The tongue elongates rapidly between the 16th and 18th day of incubation. Simultaneously, the median groove appears on the body and the lingual prominence and elongates towards the rostral part of the tongue. The conical papillae of the tongue develop gradually. On the body, the conical papillae develop from the caudal part of the body to the rostral part and on the lingual prominence from the median part of the prominence to the lateral part. Hair-like papillae at the caudal surface of the body of the tongue remain primordial to the end of the incubation. Our studies on the morphogenesis of the tongue in the domestic goose revealed changes in shape of the particular part of the tongue and rapid pace of the formation of mechanical papillae. The tongue is completely develop before hatching and ready to collect food.

Mitochondrial DNAs (mtDNAs) of 138 samples from 11 domestic goose breeds in China were investigated by digesting, with 19 restriction endonucleases. Of 19 enzymes used, seven (Bcl I, Dra I, Eco RV, Hae II, Hinc II, Kpn I, Sac I) detected polymorphic patterns. By combining 27 restriction morphs, 138 individuals were classified into 6 mtDNA haplotypes. Phylogenetic tree was constructed by using UPGMA. There was no shared haplotype between Yili breed and the other 10 breeds. Genetic distance and UPGMA tree also suggested that Yili breed and other breeds came from different ancestors. Yili breed originated from Anser anser and other 10 breeds originated from Anser cygnoides. Restriction morphs digested with 4 enzymes (EcoRV, Hae II, Hinc II and Kpn I) could be used as maternal genetic markers to distinguish the two types of domestic geese. Mitochondrial DNA polymorphism was observed in the ten breeds of Anser cygnoides. Nucleotide diversity (pi), genetic distance between the two types and the average genetic distance among the ten breeds were estimated to be 0.025%, 0.266%, 0.029%, respectively. The breeds with white plume were affected by founder effect when they were formed. Swan domestic geese, Anser cygnoides domesticus, in China might come from two different populations of Anser cygnoides at two different places.

1. Growth curves of two lines (S,D) and their reciprocal hybrids (in total,. n = 344) were evaluated by the Richards function. Geese were weighed at 7 d intervals to the ninth week, and then at 92, 154, 192 and 217 d of age. Food and water were supplied ad libitum. 2. The accuracy of curve fit measured by the coefficient of determination (R2) for different genetic groups ranged from 0.9840 to 0.9918. The highest percentage deviations between observed and estimated live weights were recorded at hatching (on average 15.1%), while at the others points of curve they were significantly lower (from 0.6 to 6.8%). 3. The geese are characterised by an early maturing rate. The peak of the absolute growth rate (the inflection point of the curve) occurred at 18.7 to 23.5 d of age (t+). The degree of maturity at a slaughter age of 63 d (u63 = y63/A) ranged from 0.69 to 0.76. Fitting the inflection point at the beginning of the linear growth phase significantly affects the maturing rate (k) and the ratio between the inflection (y+) and the asymptotic (A) weights. The values of these correlated parameters were very low (y+/A = 0.233 to 0.294, k = 0.0281 to 0.0373 ln theta/d). 4. The live weights of geese from 28 d of age and the parameters of the Richards function were significantly higher (P < 0.05, P < 0.01) in th sire line (S) than in the dam line (D). A low negative heterosis was observed at all points of the growth curves (-0.01 to -9.7%). The results indicated the effect of sex-linked growth genes. 5. The phenotypic correlations between parameters of the Richards function within genetic groups are discussed.

A special device is described which allows experiments to be performed on chronic non-anaesthetized geese. This system is composed of two elements: one is fixed to the stereotaxic apparatus, the other is implanted on the goose skull. The use of ear bars and eye and bill pieces is thus eliminated. This non-painful adaptation is well tolerated by the bird. In addition, the position of the animal with regard to stereotaxic coordinates is unchanged. This technique provides an essential tool for furthering investigations on the central nervous system in geese.

The use of social information is known to affect various important aspects of an individual's ecology, such as foraging, dispersal and space use and is generally assumed to be entirely flexible and context dependent. However, the potential link between personality differences and social information use has received little attention. In this study, we studied whether use of social information was related to personality, using barnacle geese, Branta leucopsis, where boldness is a personality trait known to be consistent over time. We found that the use of social information decreased with increasing boldness score of the individuals. Individuals had lower feeding times when they did not follow the social information and this effect was unrelated to boldness score. When manipulating social information, thereby making it incorrect, individuals irrespective of their boldness score, learned that it was incorrect and ignored it. Our results show that social information use depends on the personality type of an individual, which calls for incorporation of these personality-related differences in studies of spatial distribution of animals in which social information use plays a role.

The bean goose Anser fabalis and the pink-footed goose A. brachyrhynchus breed in the tundra and taiga zones of Eurasia and eastern Greenland, and the taxonomy of the group based on morphology has been controversial. We investigated the phylogenetic relationships within the bean goose-the pink-footed goose complex using mitochondrial control region sequences of 199 individuals collected from the breeding areas in the Palaearctic and Eastern Nearctic. We found three mitochondrial clades geographically distributed to (1) Greenland, Iceland and Svalbard (A. brachyrhynchus), (2) the eastern taiga zone (former subspecies A. fabalis middendorffii), and (3) the western taiga and the tundra zone (subspecies A. fabalisrossicus, serrirostris and fabalis). MtDNA phylogeny suggests that morphological affinities between the taxa, e.g. in the bill structure, result from convergent evolution due to adaptation to similar habitats. Although a latitudinal cline in morphology was observed, clear phylogenetic discontinuities exist in the taiga and tundra zones supporting a species status for brachyrhynchus and middendorffii.

Using LM and SEM methods, the study describes microstructures in particular areas of the tongue of the goose. A thick multilayered keratinized epithelium forms the "lingual nail" and covers small and giant conical papillae, whereby the first functions as an exoskeleton of the tongue apex, and the latter are arranged along the lingual and well-developed connective tissue cores, and together with the bill lamellae are involved in cutting. The row of conical papillae on the lingual prominence prevents regurgitation of transported food. In the area of the "lingual nail" and in the anterior part of the lingual prominence, Herbst corpuscles are accumulated, which allow to recognize food position. Filiform papillae, as widely distributed between the conical papillae of the body, are responsible for filtering. They can be explained as long keratinized processes of the epithelium and are devoid of connective tissue cores. During food transport, the flattened areas of the lingual body and the lingual prominence are protected by a parakeratinized epithelium, but the root is covered by a nonkeratinized epithelium. The presence of adipose tissue in the tongue probably reduces pressure during food passage, but also promotes mucus evacuation from the lingual glands, thus facilitating food transport. An entoglossal bone with a continuation as cartilage is the stable structural basis of the tongue system.

The invariant chain (Ii) plays a critical role in MHC class II-associated chaperone representing antigen peptide and receptor. In this study, we cloned goose Ii cDNA by 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends and tested its mRNA expression in the different tissues by fluorescent quantitative PCR. Two Ii isoforms, GIi-1and GIi-2, were 1,204 and 1,393 bp in length, respectively, and were found in all tested tissues. The expression of GIi in all tested tissues of 2-mo-old geese was higher than in that of embryos and in immune tissues was higher than in other tissues. The comparison of Ii sequences among pigeon, zebra finch, duck, chicken, quail, mouse, human, Pan troglodytes, and Salmo salar in the phylogenetic tree showed that they were classified into 5 lineages. Ii contains 5 functional domains. Further comparison between full-length Ii and each of the 5 domains of 6 species indicated a distinct difference. In 3-dimensional structures some amino acid residues located at critical sites in Ii structural region were identical or similar, which suggests that these residues were important in maintaining Ii essential secondary structures such as β-turn.

The egg white of C. atratus contains two forms of lysozyme, a 'chick-type' which is similar to that found in the egg white of the domestic hen, and a 'goose-type' similar to that found in the egg white of the Embden goose. The molecular structure of the goose-type lysozyme has been determined at a resolution of a 2.8 A by X-ray crystallographic analysis. The structure consists of two domains linked by a long stretch of alpha-helix. In all, there are seven helical segments in the structure. While there is no amino acid sequence homology with either hen egg-white or bacteriophage T4 lysozymes, there are portions of the structure where the folding of the main chain is similar to that found in portions of either hen egg-white lysozyme or T4 lysozyme or both. In particular, there is a consistency of structure in the arrangement of acid groups in the catalytic site. G-o plots calculated for this structure and for the bacteriophage T4 lysozyme structure show that both have similar 'modules' of structure with boundaries occurring at structurally equivalent positions. Three of the common boundaries are equivalent structurally to three of the four module boundaries observed in G-o plots of hen egg-white lysozyme. The variation in the position of the remaining boundary may be related to differences in substrate binding.

In the nine years from 1966 through 1974 two large flocks of geese, one Emden and the other Toulouse, averaging respectively 1959 and 734 females began laying between January 9 and February 28 with the Toulouse lagging an average of 16 days. It took a mean of 17 days to advance from the 5% to the 33-1/3% level of laying. An average rate of 29.5% was thereafter maintained for 80 days, after which it dropped to 16% in ten more days.

Histochemical characteristics and sizes of the fibers of the sternotrachealis (ST) muscle have been investigated in some Anseriformes (mallard, Pekin duck, Muscovy duck, and goose) of both sexes. A sexual dimorphism has been shown in the muscle of the species examined. In the mallard and Pekin duck, the male ST muscle shows type IIIA fibers in addition to the type I, IIA, and IIB fibers observed also in the female. In the Muscovy duck, the male muscle has only type I and IIA fibers, whereas the female muscle presents type I fibers and both types IIA and IIB fibers. Moreover, the mean frequencies for each fiber type were significantly different between males and females. In the goose, both male and female muscles present only type I and IIA fibers. In all the species examined, the mean areas of each fiber type are significantly different between male and female, being always larger in the male muscles. The anatomical sexual dimorphism observed in the ST muscle is discussed in relation to function.

Load carrying has been used to study the energetics and mechanics of locomotion in a range of taxa. Here we investigated the energetic and kinematic effects of trunk and limb loading in walking barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis). A directly proportional relationship between increasing back-load mass and metabolic rate was established, indicating that the barnacle goose can carry back loads (up to 20% of body mass) more economically than the majority of mammals. The increased cost of supporting and propelling the body during locomotion is likely to account for a major proportion of the extra metabolic cost. Sternal loads up to 15% of body mass were approximately twice as expensive to carry as back loads. Given the key role in dorso-ventral movement of the sternum during respiration we suggest that moving this extra mass may account for the elevated metabolic rate. Loading the distal limb with 5% extra mass incurred the greatest proportional rise in metabolism, and also caused increases in stride length, swing duration and stride frequency during locomotion. The increased work required to move the loaded limb may explain the high cost of walking.

1. An experiment was conducted to test the directionality, scaling and reversibility of phenotypic responses of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of adult ganders to rice husk (RH) diluted dietary switching. 2. A total of 96 140-d-old ganders were acclimatised to a basal diet for 2 weeks. The birds were randomly assigned to 4 treatments. On d 1, diets in the experimental groups were switched from the basal diet to diets which contained 200, 400 or 600 g/kg RH by mass, with no RH in the basal diet. After 21 d, the diet of all the experimental birds was switched back to the basal diet until d 42. 3. Increasing RH content significantly increased feed intake, and a decreased trend appeared after diet-switching. The weights of geese fed on the 600 g/kg RH diet for 21 d reduced, and were significantly less than those of the other three groups, while body weights (BW) of the geese in all groups increased after diet-switching back to the basal diet. At d 21, significantly heavier relative weights of proventriculus, gizzard and all gut components, except duodenum, were observed in birds fed on a 600 g/kg RH diet, and significantly heavier relative weights of gizzard were observed in birds given a 400 g/kg RH diet. Thickness of the two gastric walls, gizzard length and all gut components lengths increased significantly in birds given a 600 g/kg RH diet compared with the other three groups. At d 42, no significant differences were noted in the relative weights or lengths of GIT, except for the caeca, which were significantly heavier in birds fed on 600 g/kg RH diet. 4. The results of the experiment were in accordance with the predictions of the hypothesis that there is matching between loads and capacities. The observed phenotypic responses were directional and scaled to the demands.

Nonrandom dispersal has been recently advanced as a mechanism promoting fine-scale genetic differentiation in resident populations, yet how this applies to species with high rates of dispersal is still unclear. Using a migratory species considered a classical example of male-biased dispersal (the greater snow goose, Chen caerulescens atlantica), we documented a temporally stable fine-scale genetic clustering between spatially distinct rearing sites (5-30 km apart), where family aggregates shortly after hatching. Such genetic differentiation can only arise if, in both sexes, dispersal is restricted and nonrandom, a surprising result considering that pairing occurs among mixed flocks of birds more than 3000 km away from the breeding grounds. Fine-scale genetic structure may thus occur even in migratory species with high gene flow. We further show that looking for genetic structure based on nesting sites only may be misleading. Genetically distinct individuals that segregated into different rearing sites were in fact spatially mixed during nesting. These findings provide new, scale-dependent links between genetic structure, pairing, and dispersal and show the importance of sampling different stages of the breeding cycle in order to detect a spatial genetic structure.

Canada goose droppings, collected in parks to which the public had access, were screened for a range of bacteria that could be pathogenic in man. Droppings of Canada geese, and other waterfowl, did contain such bacteria, including some that are well-known causes of illness in man. These bacteria, plus a species of Salmonella that was experimentally inoculated into droppings, were shown to survive and multiply in the droppings for up to one month after their deposition by geese. Canada geese ranged further from water than other waterfowl species and thus distributed their droppings over a larger area of park grassland. This more widespread distribution of their droppings leads Canada geese to pose a greater potential health risk than other waterfowl studied here, but variations in human responses to challenge with bacteria, and variations in human and waterfowl behaviour in public parks, renders quantification of this risk impossible.

1. It has been known for some time that the consequences of 'decisions' made at one point in an animal's life may not always be borne immediately. For example, numerous studies have demonstrated the trade-off between current and future breeding success across multiple taxa. 2. It is becoming increasingly clear that such processes may also operate among seasons, such that the conditions experienced at one point in the annual cycle may have significant downstream impacts, or 'carry-over effects', and this is particularly evident among migratory species. We might therefore predict that certain combinations of reproductive and migratory strategy could lead to profound carry-over effects. However, the extent to which these phenomena might generate variation in fitness within a population is unclear. 3. Here, we investigate how winter habitat selection in a long-distance migrant, with extended parental care (the Light-bellied Brent goose) is influenced by parental status and how this has a counterintuitive effect on subsequent breeding success. 4. Dominant individuals and groups generally monopolize the best quality resources. In the case of geese, families are dominant; however, our findings highlight a hidden cost to raising a family. Stable isotope analysis demonstrates that later in the non-breeding season, adults with families utilize lower quality resources than non-breeders. This is probably caused by parents being constrained in habitat choice by the lower foraging efficiency of their juveniles. Consequently, parental adults end the winter in poorer condition than non-breeders. 5. We further demonstrate that parents in one year are less likely than expected to breed again in the next year and suggest that this is caused by conditions during the non-breeding period being carried over into the breeding season. In conclusion, we demonstrate previously hidden costs to raising a family, which are likely to be important in terms of life-history evolution.

The morphology of the follicular epithelium during the course of oogenesis in poultry (duck goose, hen, turkey) and at the first stages of oocyte growth in some wild birds (finch, totmit, wood-pecker, pigeon) was studied. The general patterns of the follicular epithelium changings are similar in the both groups of birds. In the process of the oocyte growth the flat follicular epithelial monolayer changes to cubic, prismatic, pseudostratified epithelium. It leads sometimes to the impression of multi-layerness owing to its irregular structure. During the oocyte rapid growth the surface of the oocyte increases causing tension on the epithelium layer. This process again turns the pseudostratified epithelium into primatic, cubic and flat epithelium. Pseudostratified structure of the follilicular epithelium is regarded as adaptation to the necessity of the rapid tension during rapid oocyte growth. Correlations of the follicular epithelium morphology with the oocyte diameter are established. Existance of a temporary multilayer stage is discussed with arguments against the interpretation of this stage as a real multilayer.

We have defined the seasonal and circadian changes of the LH level of plasma of 2 years old male and female Hungarian domestic geese by means of the LH antigen-antibody of chickens in the heterologous RIA system. The LH level of plasma in geese living in conditions of natural light does not show any variation resulting from sexual differences, but the application of GnRH analogue (Ovurelin) causes higher peaks in ganders than in females. Since the LH level of plasma at the end of November in sexually inactive birds is high at night and lower during the day; the fluctuation in females can be considered as having a circadian rhythm. Five minutes after the intravenous application of GnRH analogue the LH level reaches its peak in the plasma and this high LH level returns to pre-injection values in 3 hours. The LH level shows a characteristic seasonal cycle in both sexes. The spring peak (reproduction cycle) is followed by a definite decrease at the beginning of the photorefractoriness (mid-June) with a slight automnal increase in female geese.

1. A dose-response experiment with 5 dietary methionine concentrations (23, 33, 43, 53 and 63 g/kg) was conducted with goslings to estimate the growth performance and carcase quality response of growing goslings to dietary methionine from 28 to 70 d of age. 2. A total of 150, 28-d-old birds were randomly distributed to 15 pens with 10 birds per pen according to similar pen weight. There were 5 dietary treatments, each containing three replicate pens. Weight gain, feed intake and feed/gain of goslings from each pen were measured at 2-week intervals from 28 to 70 d of age. At 70 d of age, 4 goslings were selected randomly from each pen and slaughtered to evaluate carcase quality. 3. Significant effects of dietary methionine on daily weight gain (28-56 d) and daily feed intake were determined. Daily weight gain from 28 to 42 d and 28 to 56 d, daily feed intake and gain/feed showed significant quadratic response to increasing dietary methionine, while abdominal fat proportion showed a significant linear response. 4. When dietary CP concentration was 1582 g/kg, the optimal methionine concentrations for growing goslings from 28 to 42 d and 28 to 56 d of age for maximum daily weight gain were 407 and 4.14 g/kg, respectively.

The potential contribution of vertebrate-mediated seed rain to the maintenance of plant community richness in a High Arctic ecosystem was investigated. We analyzed viable seed content in dung of the four numerically most important terrestrial vertebrates in Northeast Greenland - muskox (Ovibos moschatus), barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis), Arctic fox (Alopex lagopus) and Arctic hare (Lepus arcticus). High numbers of plant propagules were found in the dung of muskox and barnacle goose. Seeds of many plant species were found in the faeces of one vertebrate species only. Propagule composition in barnacle goose droppings was relatively uniform over samples, with a high abundance of the nutritious bulbils of Polygonum viviparum (Bistorta vivipara), suggesting that geese have a narrow habitat preference and feed selectively. Propagule composition in muskox dung was diverse and heterogeneous among samples, suggesting a generalist approach in terms of food selection and the haphazard ingestion of plant propagules with foliage. The species composition of plant propagules in dung samples was different from that of the receiving plant communities (in terms of the Sørensen and Czekanowski dissimilarity indices), and dung deposition, especially by muskox, often brought new species to the receiving community. The results suggest that endozoochorous propagule dispersal in the Arctic has a great potential in the generation and maintenance of local species richness, albeit being little specialized. It is further suggested that endozoochory is an important means of long-distance dispersal and, thereby, of plant migration in response to climate change.

1. Results of an 8-year (1981 to 1988) period of breeding geese for egg production and crammed liver weight, including phenotypic and/or genetic parameters for various traits (1982 to 1985), as well as line tests (1987 to 1988), are summarised for two lines. 2. The regressed annual genetic gains over years were 2.7 eggs and 30.8 g crammed liver. However, there was a decline in the rate of genetic progress after 4 years of selection. 3. Heritability estimates were found to be relatively high for most traits, whereas phenotypic and genetic correlation coefficients between traits were rather low, as would be expected from lines not previously subjected to an intense selection programme. 4. Phenotypic correlation coefficients between part-period records and full-period egg production, suggest that 3-month (October to December) records may be adequate to identify most of the best first-year layers. However, sexual maturity should be treated as a separate trait. 5. The cross between the 'Grey' (male) line, superior in crammed liver weight, and the 'White' (female) line, excelling in egg production, seems to be superior to the pure lines, in a fully-integrated enterprise.

Hatchability of 69,324 fertilized eggs of White Italian geese from the WD1 maternal strain, selected for egg production, and of 25,226 eggs from the WD3 paternal strain, selected for weight gain, were compared. A significant difference was noted, but its magnitude varied during the reproduction season. Mean results for the WD1 strain (80.9%) were always higher (P < 0.01) than those of WD3 strain (75.8%). To determine the causes of this difference, goose eggs from WD1, WD3, and the Kuban (K) strain that demonstrate high reproductive performance (egg number, fertility, and hatchability) were incubated in a laboratory scale incubator. Embryonic mortality and egg weight loss during incubation were determined. Best hatchability (78.5%) was noted in eggs from K goose strain and the weight loss attained 10.9% of the initial egg weight, until Day 25 of incubation. With the higher egg weight loss in Strains WD1 (11.8%) and WD3 (13.2%), hatchability was diminished to 67.3 and 65.5%, respectively. Better hatchability resulted from lower mortality up to Day 6 of incubation and, especially, between Days 7 and 25 of incubation. The differences found in the egg weight losses and in embryonic mortality suggest a need for adjusting the incubation technique to the particular goose genotype. Embryo cultivation in vitro in plastic containers made the comparison of embryo survival possible, because the interaction of incubator microclimate by eggshell quality was eliminated. The results noted due to strain were ranked in the following order: K, WD1, and WD3. The experimental findings suggest that, apart from that of shell quality effect on various egg weight losses during incubation, there appear to be other factors that cause differences in hatchability of the goose strains studied.

A hypothesis has been formulated stating that the rate at which growth proceeds is at least partly determined by the distribution of growth between different organs. In order to test the hypothesis a series of studies of organ growth has been undertaken in some birds with widely ranging growth rate factors. This study describes the postnatal growth and the pattern of organ development of the goose, a species with a high growth rate factor. The results show that the pattern of organ growth is characterized by an early development of the digestive organs and the liver and by a late development of the wings, pectorals and feathers. These results are in close agreement with the hypothesis.

Cultural transmission is thought to be a mechanism by which migratory animals settle into habitats, but little evidence exists in wild populations because of the difficulty of following individuals over successive generations and wide geographical distances. Cultural inheritance of migration routes represents a mechanism whereby geographical isolation can arise between separate groups and could constrain individuals to potentially suboptimal sites within their range. Conversely, adopting the parental migratory route in adult life, rather than dispersing randomly, may increase an individual's reproductive success because that strategy has already been proven to allow successful breeding. We combined a pedigree of related light-bellied Brent geese (Branta bernicla hrota) with 6 years of observations of marked birds to calculate the dispersal distances of adult offspring from their parents in both Ireland and Iceland. In both countries, the majority of offspring were found to recruit into or near their parental sites, indicating migratory connectivity in the flyway. Despite this kin structure, we found no evidence of genetic differentiation using genotype data from 1127 individuals across 15 microsatellite loci. We suggest that the existence of migratory connectivity of subpopulations is far more common than previous research indicates and that cultural information may play an important role in structuring reproductive isolation among them.

The occurrence of helminths in broiler geese was studied in the rapid-fattening technological system in 1974-1978. The birds were kept on grassy run adjacent to water. Helminthological examination was performed in 1065 broilers and the following 16 helminth species were revealed: Notocotylus attenuatus (0.3%), Apatemon gracilis (1.5%), Cotyrulus cornutus (0.1%), Hypoderaeum conoideum (0.1%), Retinometra longicirrosa (3.2%), Drepanidotaenia lanceolata (3.1%), Sobolevicanthus fragilis (0.7%), Diorchis stefanskii (0.8%), Microsomacanthus microsoma (0.9%), Dilepis undula (0.1%), Capillaria caudinflata (0.2%), Capillaria obsignata (7.7%), Amidostomum anseris (3.7%), Trichostrongylus tenuis (0.2%), Ganguleterakis dispar (16.8%), and Heterakis gallinarum (0.4%). Seven of these species were found for the first time in geese in Czechoslovakia (A. gracilis, C. cornutus, H. conoideum, M. microsoma, D. undula, C. caudinflata, and H. gallinarum). The species Dilepis undula has not been recorded in this host species ever before. The extensity and intensity of the invasions, the frequency of monoinvasions and mixed invasions, and the relation of invasion extensity and intensity to the age of the broilers examined were evaluated during the study.

1. Predation plays an integral role in many community interactions, with the number of predators and the rate at which they consume prey (i.e. their functional response) determining interaction strengths. Owing to the difficulty of directly observing predation events, attempts to determine the functional response of predators in natural systems are limited. Determining the forms that predator functional responses take in complex systems is important in advancing understanding of community interactions. 2. Prey survival has a direct relationship to the functional response of their predators. We employed this relationship to estimate the functional response for bald eagle Haliaeetus leucocepalus predation of Canada goose Branta canadensis nests. We compared models that incorporated eagle abundance, nest abundance and alternative prey presence to determine the form of the functional response that best predicted intra-annual variation in survival of goose nests. 3. Eagle abundance, nest abundance and the availability of alternative prey were all related to predation rates of goose nests by eagles. There was a sigmoidal relationship between predation rate and prey abundance and prey switching occurred when alternative prey was present. In addition, predation by individual eagles increased as eagle abundance increased. 4. A complex set of interactions among the three species examined in this study determined survival rates of goose nests. Results show that eagle predation had both prey- and predator-dependent components with no support for ratio dependence. In addition, indirect interactions resulting from the availability of alternative prey had an important role in mediating the rate at which eagles depredated nests. As a result, much of the within-season variation in nest survival was due to changing availability of alternative prey consumed by eagles. 5. Empirical relationships drawn from ecological theory can be directly integrated into the estimation process to determine the mechanisms responsible for variation in observed survival rates. The relationship between predator functional response and prey survival offers a flexible and robust method to advance our understanding of predator-prey interactions in many complex natural systems where prey populations are marked and regularly visited.

Although water availability is primarily seen as a factor affecting food availability (a bottom-up process), we examined its effect on predator-prey interactions through an influence on prey behavior (a top-down process). We documented a link between water availability, predation risk, and reproductive success in a goose species (Chen caerulescens atlantica) inhabiting an Arctic environment where water is not considered a limited commodity. To reach water sources during incubation recesses, geese nesting in mesic tundra (low water availability) must move almost four times as far from their nest than those nesting in wetlands, which reduced their ability to defend their nest against predators and led to a higher predation rate. Nesting success was improved in high rainfall years due to increased water availability, and more so for geese nesting in the low water availability habitat. Likewise, nesting success was improved in years where the potential for evaporative water loss (measured by the atmospheric water vapor pressure) was low, presumably because females had to leave their nest less often to drink. Females from water-supplemented nests traveled a shorter distance to drink, and their nesting success was enhanced by 20% compared to the control. This shows that water availability and rainfall can have a strong effect on predator-prey dynamics and that changes in precipitation brought by climate change could have an impact on some Arctic species through a top-down effect.

A pair of primers with BamH I restriction site were designed to amplify the complete genome of goose circovirus. Two copies of the genome were ligated in tandem and cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector to construct an infectious clone named as pGEMT-2GoCV. The pGEMT-2GoCV linearized with EcoR I was transfected to negative embryos and gosling with Lipfectamine. PCR detection verified the proliferation of GoCV in geese. Some sera of the embryo transfected group were detected to be positive at 2 and 4 weeks after hatching and one bursa was detected to be positive at 4 weeks. Some sera of the gosling transfected group were also detected to be positive at 2 weeks after transfection. Furthermore, the mark in the PCR products were identified by BamH I digestion and the GoCV in positive tissue and sera were quantitated by Real-time PCR. The results showed that the virus load in positive bursa was 1.57 x 10(6) copies/mg, the virus load in positive sera were 3.52 x 10(4)-5.92 x 10(5) copies/microL. In conclusion, the infectious DNA clone constructed with two copies of full-length GoCV genome in tandem can transfect embryo and gosling and propagate the marked goose circovirus.

A new reagent was designed to the indirect hemagglutination test (IHATIAL), utilizing goose red blood cells as inert matrix and standardized for the field diagnosis of American trypanosomiasis. The objective was to substitute the lyophilized or frozen reagent of IHAT produced routinely using human erythrocytes in the Adolfo Lutz Institute (São Paulo/Brazil). The standardized reagent presented a long stability in liquid suspension, and was evaluated in 137 serum samples from patient with and without Chagas' disease, by IHATIAL. The diagnostic performance of this test was similar to the IHAT utilizing human erythrocytes and to that of a commercial IHAT kit. The sensitivity was 1.00, specificity 0.98, predictive value of positive 0.96 and of negative 1.00. Different batches of reagent successively produced proved to be reproducible in a quality control method. The new reagent is more economic than the former reagent, it can be produced easily and may be applicable to the seroepidemiologic studies.

The influence of acute intravascular volume expansion on salt gland secretion of conscious, adult geese was investigated. The intravenous administration of 5% dextran in Krebs-bicarbonate-Ringer solution in an amount equivalent to 30% of the estimated blood volume caused a transient but highly significant increase in salt gland secretion independent of changes in plasma osmolality or sodium concentration. Intravenous veratrine (60 microng) caused a similar increase in salt gland secretion only when administered after the volume load. Intravenous 5% NaCl always caused a prolonged and significant increase in salt gland secretion which was not potentiated by veratrine. Volume expansion and hypertonic saline caused a significant tachycardia while veratrine caused a significant bradycardia. It is concluded that a volume component may contribute to the initiation of salt gland secretion in the goose and that the peripheral receptor involved is most likely vascular in origin.

We have tested the hypothesis that a large (2 kg) migratory bird, such as the barnacle goose Branta leucopsis, becomes hypothermic before its autumn migration, when food is not scarce, but when it is necessary to conserve and/or store energy in the form of fat. Abdominal temperature (T(ab)) was measured in wild geese using an implanted data logger. Commencing a few days before and continuing until approximately 20 days after the start of their autumn migration, mean daily T(ab) fell progressively by 4.4 degrees C. Thus, it is suggested that, rather than increasing the rate of pre-migratory fattening, the energy saved as a result of this hypothermia reduces the rate at which fat is used and thus enables its more rapid replacement following and, possibly during, migration. The energy saved may also be used for the replacement of non-fat tissues such as the locomotory muscles and gastro-intestinal tract. These observations are the first of their kind from birds in their natural environment and, together with other data, demonstrate that hypothermia in endotherms is not necessarily related to extremely low environmental temperature, to shortage of food or to the resting phase of the daily cycle. The data also highlight the relationship between hypothermia and fat deposition over extended periods in relatively large, endothermic animals and may have some relevance to obesity in humans.

We modified the multiple inert gas elimination technique, which was originally developed for alveolar lungs, to measure continuous distributions of V/Q in the cross-current lungs of birds. In theory, the method is also applicable to counter-current gas exchangers. The algorithms for inferring essentially continuous V/Q distributions from a limited number of measurements and the least-squares approach for dealing with experimental error are independent of the model of gas exchanger being studied. A Monte-Carlo procedure was used to predict the expected frequency of occurrence of given magnitudes of experimental error for each model. If the observed frequency distribution of error exceeds the predicted, then this indicates an incorrect choice of model (analogous to chi-square tests). Thirty-four data sets from 8 geese indicate that: (1) the assumptions of the technique are adequately met; (2) the alveolar model is not appropriate for birds, but the cross-current model is; and therefore; (3) the cross-current modification of the multiple inert gas elimination technique can be used to assess V/Q inequality in avian lungs.

Social interactions are among the most potent stressors. However, social allies may diminish stress, increase success in agonistic encounters and ease access to resources. We studied the role of social support as a major mechanism for individual stress management in families of free-ranging greylag geese (Anser anser). Greylag geese are long-term monogamous, live in a female-bonded social system, and fledged offspring stay with their parents until the next breeding season ('primary families'). Should parents then fail to fledge young, subadults might rejoin them in summer after molt is completed ('secondary families'). We have previously shown that primary greylag goose families reap benefits from active social support in agonistic encounters, and also excrete lower levels of immuno-reactive corticosterone metabolites (CORT, 'passive social support'). Here we investigated how far active and passive social support continues in secondary goose families. Although we found that active support in agonistic encounters was almost absent in secondary families, subadult male geese won an increased number of agonistic encounters due to the mere presence of their secondary family. Particularly adult and subadult females benefited from passive social support through decreased CORT, whereas males did not. Decrease in the hormonal stress response during challenging situations, induced by social allies, may help the females' long-term energy management, thereby improving the odds for successful future reproduction. We discuss whether joining a secondary family may be an alternative tactic for young geese towards optimizing their start into a complex social life.

1. Growth rate, food intake and utilisation were determined for goslings (Anser cireneus) from hatching to 7 weeks of age. 2. The relative weight of the carcass (body without feathers, skin or intestinal content) decreased from 0.83 of total body weight at hatching to 0.73 at 7 weeks. The skin relative weight increased from 0.12 at hatching to 0.17 at 2 weeks of age and subsequently remained constant. The weight of feathers increased from 0.034 of body weight at hatching to 0.08 at 7 weeks. 3. The fat of the carcass and skin increased during the 7-week experimental period. The skin retained about half of the total body fat. 4. While amino acid compositions of feathers and skin proteins were quite similar to data reported for other birds, carcass proteins were lower in methionine and lysine.

The 1 042 bp control region of mitochondrial DNA from 84 geese of 15 domestic goose breeds was sequenced and genetic differentiation was analysed. Results showed that the interpopulation nucleotide divergence was highest (3.805% -4.067%) between Yili and the other 14 breeds. The average nucleotide diversity variation within different domestic breeds was 0 - 0.116%. Excluding the Yili, the interpopulation nucleotide divergence between Huoyan and the remaining breeds, was 0.211% - 0.272%, which was significantly higher than that between any other two breeds (0 -0.094%). During the formation of domestic breeds in China,there is an association between the genetic differentiation of domestic geese and their geographic distribution. The divergence time of Huoyan breed was relatively earlier and genetic drift may have been the main factor to affect the genetic differentiation of the Huoyan breed (Nm = 0.02 -0.54). On the other hand, gene flow is the main reason for the lack of a clear differentiation among the remaining 13 Chinese domestic geese breeds (Nm = 12.0 - 65.33).

Ultrastructural changes in the pineal gland were studied in relation to migration, breeding and moult. Sizes of pinealocytes and that of their nuclei were greatest in the Spring premigratory and postmigratory, and moult phases. The ratio of nuclear size to cell size was greatest for the breeding phase and lowest for the Fall premigratory and postmigratory phases. The Golgi complex was most prominent during premigratory and breeding phases. Mitochondria which were numerous in all phases except during moult, were markedly enlarged during breeding and Fall premigratory phases. Dense-core vesicles were predominant in Spring postmigratory and moult phases. In glial cells, lipoid inclusions were abundant in Spring premigratory and postmigratory, and breeding phases. Glycogen granules were abundant in Spring postmigratory, breeding and moult phases. Large vacuoles were present in Fall premigratory phase. Lamellar membraneous whorls were often present near luminal spaces during Spring premigratory and postmigratory, and breeding phases. The endothelial cells of pineal capillaries during Spring and Fall premigratory phases, contained numerous vesicles, some of which were freely dispersed in the cytoplasm while others were fused to the cell membrane, suggestive of transendothelial transport of vesicular substances.

1. Goose can be considered as an additional and inexpensive meat source, provided that the marketing age does not exceed 8 weeks. Using the ability of geese to eat grass may reduce the intake of concentrated food up to 30%. 2. According to an equation developed, growth rate accounts for about 58% of the annual breeding gains, egg number 28%, feather yield 10%, fertility and mortality about 2%. These values are about the same for a wide range of food prices. 3. Employing realistic values for expected annual genetic gains reveals that the customary practice of keeping breeders for 5 to 6 years should be replaced by a much shorter cycle of 3 years because the economic gain from the shorter generation interval of selection exceeds the replacement costs.

The ultimate compressive strength and modulus of elasticity of femoral cortical bone from adult geese (Anser anser), were determined by sex and by quadrant by compressing small right circular cylinders which were 2.4 mm in height and 0.8 mm in diameter. The average ultimate compressive strength was 183 +/- 29 MPa. The average modulus of elasticity was 13.2 +/- 3.4 GPa. The bending strength and bending modulus of elasticity were determined by a three point bend test on rectangular prisms which had the approximate dimensions 0.75 mm X 0.75 mm X 25 mm. The average bending strength was 263 +/- 44 MPa while the average bending modulus was 19.6 +/- 3.1 GPa. The calcium content was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry and no correlation was found with the mechanical properties. The histology of the cortical bone was examined both quantitatively and qualitatively. A unique type of Haversian bone is described. Goose bone was found to be morphologically similar to adolescent human bone and to have mechanical properties similar to those of adult human bone.

Changes in ultrastructure of the posterior lobe pituicytes during six phases (Spring premigratory, Spring postmigratory, breeding, moulting, Fall premigratory and Fall postmigratory) of the annual life cycle of the migratory Canada goose, were studied. Pituicyte nuclear volume in females was significantly greater than that in males during the Spring premigratory and moulting phases. In the Fall postmigratory phase, nuclear volume in males was greater than that in females. During Spring premigratory phase, the axonal endings in males contained fewer neurosecretory granules (NSG) than those in the Fall postmigratory phase. In females, however, the number of NSG was relatively more than that in males in the Spring premigratory phase but fewer in the moulting phase. Nuclear volume is correlated with pituicyte function in releasing NSG containing arginine vasotocin (AVT) from axonal endings. The significance of AVT release is discussed in relation to initiation of reproductive and migratory behaviour, and to osmotic and metabolic regulation.

The adrenal medulla in mammalian species is surrounded by a cortex that contains three distinct layers, whereas the cortex and medulla are intermingled in poultry species. The objective of the present study was to determine the distinct zonation changes in the adrenal cortex of geese in various ages using both electron and light microscopy. Adrenal glands were obtained from French Geese (Anser anser) under deep ether anesthesia at posthach day 1, 5, 10, 21 and 30 (n= 5 per day). The cytoplasm of interrenal cells located beneath the adrenal capsule (sub-capsular zone, SCZ) were stained lighter than that of interrenal cells located inside the adrenal gland (inner zone, IZ) and contained several vacuoles for each sampling day. Additionally, unlike IZ cells, SCZ cells contained nuclei that were various shapes and surrounded by irregularly arranged membranes, lipid droplets which were not surrounded by a membrane, mitochondria with mostly shelf-like cristae. The arrangement of SCZ cells appears similar to that of zona glomerulosa and also the arrangement of IZ cells to that of zona fasciculata of mammalian adrenal cortex, suggesting the significant signs of zonation in goose adrenal cortex.

The primary structures of the alpha D-chains of the minor component Hb D of Anser indicus, Anser anser and Branta canadensis are presented. Following chain separation by RP-HPLC, the amino-acid sequences were established by automatic Edman degradation of the globin chains and the tryptic peptides. The three chains show a high degree of homology. For the high altitude respiration the alpha 1 beta 1 interface at position alpha 119 is important. For the Bar-headed Goose a mechanism for high altitude respiration involving both Hb A having alanine at position 119 and Hb D having proline at that position is suggested. Furthermore, a possible genetical development of the avian alpha D-gene expression based on a new B alpha-box mutation in the three geese and an unusual 5' splice junction (GT/GC-transition) in the duck gene is discussed. We consider the possibility that the alpha D-gene is an intermediate between a functional gene, reduced in its expression, and a pseudogene.

The objective of the study was to clone avian beta-defensin (AvBD) 3 gene from goose tissues, express the recombinant AvBD3 protein in Escherichia coli, and determine its antimicrobial activity. The mRNA of goose AvBD3 was cloned from spleen and bursa of Fabricius of the gooses by RT-PCR. The sequence analysis showed that the genefragment of AvBD3 contained 182 bp, and encoded 60 amino acids. Homology analysis showed that goose AvBD3 shared the highest percentage of amino acid homology (100%) with chicken AvBD3. The cDNA of goose AvBD3 was sub-cloned into BamH I and Sal I sites of pGEX-6p-1 vector to construct recombinant plasmid pGEX-goose AvBD3. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 and the bacteria was induced with IPTG It was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE that a 31 kDa protein which was equal to goose AvBD3 protein in molecular weight was highly expressed. The purified recombinant goose AvBD3 exhibited extensive antimicrobial activity against twelve bacteria strains, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative investigated. At high salt ions conditions, antimicrobial activity of recombinant goose AvBD3 protein against both Staphylococcus aureus and Pasteurella multocida decreased significantly. In addition, hemolysis activity of the recombinant protein was extremely low, and the recombinant protein remained antimicrobial activity under different pH values.

Plasma 13,14-dihydro-15-keto prostaglandin F2alpha (PGFM) and progesterone levels were determined in actively ovulating, 1- to 2-yr-old female geese (Anser anser domesticus) at hourly intervals during the oviposition cycle, using the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) technique. The plasma PGFM concentration showed a peak at the time of oviposition and decreased to a basal level after oviposition. Progesterone levels began to surge approximately 12 to 13 h before ovulation and reached a peak 2 to 3 h before ovulation. The plasma progesterone concentrations returned to basal level at the time of ovulation. The present method of EIA was found to have practical application in analyses of progesterone and PGFM in plasma of birds.

The aim of this work was to reveal the current form of village chicken production in Tokat province of Turkey. A survey was applied to 153 randomly selected farmers of 5 subdistricts in Tokat province. The ratios of domestic fowls in the survey region were as follows: hen 98.83%, goose 0.65%, turkey 0.29% and duck 0.16% (P < 0.01). Feather colours of laying hens were white (2.76%), brown (8.63%) and mixed color (88.60%). The hen farms in this region consisted of native breeds (91.42%), commercial breeds (5.71%) and their crosses (2.85%). The mean egg weight of the village hens was between 30 and 40 g. Wheat (65.73%) and mixed (wheat, barley, maize and kitchen refuse) feed (34.22%) were used to supplement the hens (P < 0.01). For producing natural chicks, the hens were brooded between 1.10 and 1.46 times/year, 1.31 on average. For each brooding, the number of placed eggs under the broody hens was between 11.39 and 12.42 (P < 0.05).

We measured mean pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) during temporary unilateral pulmonary arterial occlusion (TUPAO) in 10 ducks. Ppa increased from 11.4 +/- 0.8 mmHg during control conditions to 18.8 +/- 1.8 during TUPAO. In 5 of the 10 ducks we also measured mean left atrial pressure (Pla) and cardiac output (Q). In these ducks Ppa significantly increased with TUPAO from 13.9 +/- 0.4 to 22.0 +/- 1.2 mmHg, whereas Pla and Q did not change significantly. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) increased from 10.6 +/- 1.3 to 24.1 +/- 5.3 mmHg X min X 1(-1) on TUPAO. By assuming equal vascular resistance in either lung it can be calculated that the vascular resistance in only one lung was 22.5 +/- 3.5 mmHg X min X 1(-1) during control conditions. Thus doubling flow resulted in no significant change in one lung's vascular resistance. A morphometric study of both lungs of a domestic goose that were rapidly frozen during TUPAO indicated very little compliance in pulmonary blood capillaries. The relative volume of exchange tissue occupied by blood capillaries was 0.28 in the occluded lung and 0.36 in the perfused lung. Surface-to-volume ratios of blood capillaries were 12,524 cm-1 in the occluded lung and 11,056 cm-1 in the perfused lung. We conclude that PVR in birds is relatively insensitive to changes in Q, in contrast to mammals.

Red-breasted goose colonies have been studied near Medusa Bay (73 degrees 21' N, 80 degrees 32' E), on the northwestern Taimyr Peninsula, and along the Agapa River (70 degrees 11' N, 86 degrees 15' E) down to its mouth (70 degrees 26' N, 89 degrees 13' E), in the central Taimyr Peninsula. Red-breasted geese nesting near peregrine falcons are protected by the falcons from arctic foxes; however, they are sometimes attacked by the falcons themselves. In the colonies near peregrine falcon nests, the vast majority of goose nests were situated no farther than 100 m from the falcon nest. When food is abundant, falcons protect a larger area around their nest. The distance between the falcon nest and the surrounding goose nests is inversely related to the falcon's activity. In years of higher falcon activity, falcons prevent red-breasted geese from nesting as close to their nest as in years of lower falcon activity. Additional stimuli are required for red-breasted geese to form colonies near rough-legged buzzard nests. The distance between snowy owl nests and red-breasted goose nests was smaller when arctic foxes were abundant than when they were scarce.

Cell structure of the hypothalamic preoptic region in goose has been studied and topographical relations of the following nuclei (n.) are shown: n. preopticus rostralis, n. preopticus periventricularis, n. preopticus medialis, n. supraopticus, n. suprachiasmaticus, n. preopticus lateralis, n. magnocellularis preopticus, n. rostralis hypothalami, n. supraopticus caudalis, n. decussationis supraopticae dorsalis and n. decussationis supraopticae ventralis. The nomenclature given in Nomina anatomica avium (Breazile 1979) has been used, as for as possible.

The aim of the research was to compare the karyotypes of two goose species: the European domestic goose and the Asian goose on the basis of the karyotype of their interspecific cross-breed, using the RBG chromosome staining technique. The karyotype standard for Anseriformes has not been determined yet. The RBG technique is considered as one of the standard methods for analysing chromosomes. It is a dynamic method. The R bands appear during the cell growth cycle in the early S phase. The formation of the characteristic band configuration for each chromosome facilitates chromosome segregation and analysis. The mitotic chromosomes for experiments were obtained from an in vitro blood lymphocyte culture and stained according to the RBG technique. The first eight largest autosome pairs and the ZW sex chromosomes were analysed. No differences were found between the band patterns of the analysed chromosomes, except for the fourth autosome pair.

The genetic diversity of six goose breeds (White Goose, Zi Goose, Huoyan Goose, Wanxi Goose, Rhin, Landoise) was analyzed using microsatellite markers. Heterozygosity(H), polymorphism information content (PIC) and genetic distances were calculated for each breed based on the allele frequency. Results showed that 7 microsatellite sites were highly polymorphic, and could be used as effective markers for analysis of genetic relationship among different goose breeds. The mean heterozygosityies of were between 0.6617 (Rhin) and 0.8814 (Zi goose), among six goose breeds, the lowest was Rhin goose (0.6617) and the highest was Zi goose (0.8814). The range of mean PIC was between 0.6145 and 0.7814, which was in the similar range as the mean heterozygosities. Based on the UPGMA cluster analysis results, six goose breeds were grouped into classes, White, Zi, Huoyan and Wanxi Goose in one class, and the foreign breeds of Rhin and Landoise goose in another class. These results indicated that the dendrogram obtain from genetic distance could be used to correctly reflect the phylogenetic relationship among the six goose breeds, suggesting that microsatellite DNA marker is a useful tool to determine the genetic diversity in closely related breeds.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the nuclear 5S rDNA gene has been used for the identification of goose and mule duck foie gras. Two species-specific reverse primers were designed and used in a multiplex reaction, together with a forward universal primer, to amplify specific fragments of the 5S rDNA in each species. The different sizes of the species-specific amplicons, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, allowed clear identification of goose and mule duck foie gras samples. This genetic marker can be useful for detecting fraudulent substitution of the duck liver for the more expensive goose liver.

We measured the ventilatory response of anesthetized, unidirectionally ventilated pigeons and burrowing owls to changes in intrapulmonary CO2 concentration and the static CO2 sensitivity of intrapulmonary chemoreceptors (IPC) in these species and the domestic goose. Compared with pigeons, burrowing owls showed a significantly reduced respiratory frequency and amplitude response to increases in FICO2 from 0.05 to 0.10, which corroborates similar findings in intact, awake individuals of the same species. The average static CO2 sensitivity of IPC in geese, pigeons, and burrowing owls, as reflected by the average slope of the linear regressions of receptor discharge frequency on ln(PICO2), was -7.96, -11.1 and -6.87 imp/sec . ln(PICO2), respectively. The sensitivities of individual receptors were normally distributed in geese and pigeons, but skewed in burrowing owls. Therefore, the median CO2 sensitivity [-5.50 imp/sec . ln(PICO2)] is a more appropriate measure of the typical CO2 sensitivity of IPC in burrowing owls. The static CO2 sensitivity of IPC in burrowing owls is the lowest reported for euthermic birds with a normal acid-base balance and may materially contribute to the blunted ventilatory response of these birds to the elevated CO2 levels they encounter in nature.

Using RAPD PCR analysis and sequencing of the 5' end segment of the mtDNA control region, the genetic diversity and differentiation of Far Eastern populations of greater white-fronted goose Anser albifrons Scopoli, 1769 and bean goose Anser fabalis Latham, 1787 were examined. Based on RAPD PCR data, the level of gene diversity (h) for A. albifrons (0.3634) and A. fabalis (0.3899) was calculated. Sequence data showed considerably higher level of inter-population diversity in A. fabalis (26.4%), compared to A. albifrons (1.88%). Similarly, the nucleotide and haplotype diversity parameters were somewhat higher in A. fabalis (0.01852 and 0.955). Phylogenetic reconstructions generated using neighbor-joining and maximum parsimony algorithms divided each of the examined species into two clusters that differ in the number of haplotypes included. These clusters can correspond to the subspecies that live in the Far East.

This is a study of the comparative physiology of the feeding sequence in 24 Landes geese fed ad libitum. The relative parameters of feeding behavior and the apparatuses used have been described. We found that the 24-hour light/dark cycle, corresponding to maximal ingestion, was not the same in all the animals studied. Two groups were distinguished: those tending to be diurnal and those tending to be nocturnal. The feeding pattern of the animals in each group and from day to day was constant. The correlation between the amount ingested during the meal and the length of pre or post-prandial intervals showed great variation, and the choice of meal definition considerably affected the results.

Mitochondrial DNA plays an important role in living organisms, and has been used as a powerful molecular marker in a variety of evolutionary studies. In this study, we determined the complete mtDNA of Bean goose (Anser fabalis), which is 16,688 bp long and contains 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNAs, 22 tRNAs and a control region. The arrangement is similar to that of typical Anseriform species. All protein-coding genes, except for Cyt b, ND5, COI, and COII, start with an ATG codon. The ATG start codon is also generally observed in the 12 other Anseriform species, including 2 Anser species, with sequenced mitochondrial genomes. TAA is the most frequent stop codon, one of three-TAA, TAG, and T- -commonly observed in Anseriformes. All tRNAs could be folded into canonical cloverleaf secondary structures except for tRNA(Ser)(AGY) and tRNA(Leu)(CUN), which are missing the dihydrouridine (DHU) arm. The control region of Bean goose mtDNA, with some conserved sequence boxes, such as F, E, D, and C, identified in its central domain. Phylogenetic analysis of complete mtDNA data for 13 Anseriform species supports the classification of them into four major branches: Anatinae, Anserinae, Dendrocygninae and Anseranatidae. Phylogenetic analyses were also conducted on 36 Anseriform birds using combined Cyt b, ND2, and COI sequences. The results clearly support the genus Somateria as an independent lineage classified in its own tribe, the Somaterini. Recovered topologies from both complete mtDNA and combined DNA sequences strongly indicate that Dendrocygninae is an independent subfamily within the family Anatidae and Anseranatidae represents an independent family. Based on the results of this study, we conclude that combining ND2, Cyt b, and COI sequence data is a workable solution at present for resolving phylogenetic relationships among Anseriform species in the absence of sufficient complete mtDNA data.

1. Successful reproduction requires numerous decisions, and some of which may require trade-offs between current and future reproduction. We studied effects of choice of foraging patches on gosling growth and future breeding by mothers in black brent (Branta bernicla nigricans) geese. 2. Specific foraging areas consistently produced high-quality goslings over 21 years. We found a consistent ranking of gosling mass, corrected for age, across brood rearing areas (BRAs) and years [Akaike model weights, Σw(i)  = 1·00 for models including additive effects of BRA and year]. Growth of goslings largely determines their future fitness, so areas where goslings grew most rapidly also produced goslings with the highest mean fitness. 3. We used a multistate robust design capture-mark-recapture approach to estimate the probability of transitioning from a breeding state to a non-breeding (unobservable) state as a function of quality of BRA. 4. In the best supported model, transition from a breeding state to a non-breeding state was positively related to gosling growth rates across BRAs. Thus, future reproduction was lower for females using BRAs that produced higher-quality goslings. Our results are consistent with trade-offs by individual brent between fitness of their current offspring and their own reproductive value.

The aim of this study was to genetically analyse by the RAPD-PCR method four indigenous Polish goose breeds, Kartuska (Ka), Lubelska (Lu), Kielecka (Ki) and Podkarpacka (Pd), in order to determine the band-sharing frequency as well as bands characteristic of the evaluated breeds. The birds were maintained as conservative flocks, accounting for a reserve of genetic resources. A total of 102 scorable bands were obtained, their number ranging from 0 to 8, depending on one of seven primers used and the group of birds analyzed, within a mean of 3.64. For each genetic group specific bands with given primers were obtained, suggesting their potential for use as population-specific markers, especially in ex-situ conservation methods. The results also suggest that keeping endangered geese as separate flocks is relevant for their preservation.

Experimental infection of domestic fowl, ducks and geese with an influenza A virus (H7N2) isolated from a domestic duck showed that this virus was apathogenic for these poultry. A second virus (H6N2), also apathogenic and more 'non-avid' than any such isolates previously recognised in surveillance of domestic poultry in Hong Kong, was isolated from one goose after H7N2 shedding had ceased. This goose, in effect, acted as a selective isolation system for the H6N2 virus whose presence in the field isolate could not be detected in spite of multiple passage in embryonated eggs.

We assessed ventilation-perfusion inequality in 8 anesthetized, tidally ventilated geese in terms of continuous V/Q distributions using the multiple inert gas elimination technique modified for cross-current avian lungs (Powell and Wagner, 1982). Thirty-four data sets were collected. Allowing for differences in solubility, high molecular weight gases (Enflurane, SF6) were not retained in the blood to any greater extent than the other gases, suggesting that diffusion in the gas phase is functionally complete. Shunt averaged only 0.4 +/- 0.1% (SEM) of cardiac output and areas of low V/Q were seldom seen. Twenty-nine of the 34 data sets had bimodal V/Q distributions with 10.6 +/- 1.4% of expired ventilation and 0.3 +/- 0.1% of cardiac output in a high V/Q mode; the physiological basis of the high mode is unknown. The log-standard deviation of the main Q mode averaged 0.56 or slightly greater than that for healthy men, dogs, or earlier estimates from unidirectionally ventilated birds. It is predicted that CO2 will be more impaired by such V/Q inequality than O2, but that increased ventilation will overcome the CO2 impairment more easily than that of O2 transport.

In anseriform birds the mediodorsal part of the rostral forebrain is covered by a corticoid (= layered) structure, establishing a unique feature of this avian group since in other birds the non-cortical accessory or dorsal hyperstriatum occupies the corresponding surface area of the hemisphere. The efferents of the olfactory bulb are shown to reach this region, which thus can be identified as a heavily enlarged retrobulbar area. The large expansion of this olfactory representation may indicate an important biological function. In comparison to the mammalian olfactory system the three stratified olfactory projection centers of birds should be regarded as retrobulbar, prepiriform and periamygdalar regions.

Lampbrush chromosomes (LBCs) present in bird oocytes are a new model in cytogenetics with particular significance for bird chromosome analysis. The fact that female birds are heterogametic makes it possible to observe both sex chromosomes in the form of decondensed structures typical of lampbrush chromosomes. A change in transcription activity associated with physiological processes in geese prior to and after the reproductive season is reflected in chromosome morphology. Lampbrush chromosomes obtained after the reproductive period have reduced side loops, sites of intensive transcriptional activity. However, noticeable characteristics in the chromosomes include inactive chromomeres. Chiasms, PBs, large side loops (ML) and telomeric loops (T, TLL, and GLL) are structures that undergo degradation latest after the termination of reproduction, and as a result, constitute the basis of identification of individual bivalents in different periods of the cell's transcriptional activity.

The domestic goose is hyperphagic after a fast resulting in a 40% decrease in body mass (a decrease similar to that during breeding anorexia). Food intake is maximum on the 8th day of refeeding. As it is then an average of 2.5 times higher than before the fast, food intake may thus reach the value during forced-feeding for "foie gras". Since nitrogen assimilation rate also increases 2.5 times, nitrogen fixation is increased 6.8 times, suggesting a high level of protein synthesis.

Conspecific brood parasitism (CBP), females laying eggs in the nest of other 'host' females of the same species, is a common alternative reproductive tactic among birds. For hosts there are likely costs of incubating and rearing foreign offspring, but costs may be low in species with precocial chicks such as waterfowl, among which CBP is common. Waterfowl show strong female natal philopatry, and spatial relatedness among females may influence the evolution of CBP. Here we investigate fine-scale kin structure in a Baltic colony of barnacle geese, Branta leucopsis, estimating female spatial relatedness using protein fingerprints of egg albumen, and testing the performance of this estimator in known mother-daughter pairs. Relatedness was significantly higher between neighbour females (nesting < or = 40 metres from each other) than between females nesting farther apart, but there was no further distance trend in relatedness. This pattern may be explained by earlier observations of females nesting close to their mother or brood sisters, even when far from the birth nest. Hosts and parasites were on average not more closely related than neighbour females. In 25 of 35 sampled parasitized nests, parasitic eggs were laid after the host female finished laying, too late to develop and hatch. Timely parasites, laying eggs in the host's laying sequence, had similar relatedness to hosts as that between neighbours. Females laying late parasitic eggs tended to be less related to the host, but not significantly so. Our results suggest that CBP in barnacle geese might represent different tactical life-history responses.

Previous studies of cecal sugar and amino acid transport in the domestic chicken led to a widely held generalization that the avian cecum is unimportant as a site of nutrient transport. In fact, we found that the uptake capacity of the cecum for hexose sugars and amino acids is substantial in some species of birds. Cecal transport of glucose was measurable in all five study species (Canada goose, sage grouse, domestic chicken, red-necked phalarope, and rock dove), approached or exceeded intestinal levels in the grouse and phalarope, and accounted for between 0.1% (rock dove) and 49% (sage grouse) of the whole gut's integrated uptake capacity. Proline uptake averaged higher in the proximal portion of the cecum than in any region of the small intestine for all species but the goose. The ceca contributed between 2% (rock dove) and 25% (sage grouse) of the gut's integrated uptake capacity for proline. Similar ranges were found for fructose, lysine, leucine, and aspartate. Future studies should be undertaken to search for phylogenetic and ecological correlates of the interspecific variation in cecal transport and to determine how nutrient transport integrates with other functions of the avian cecum.

The mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) gene of 17 breeds of domestic goose (2 in Europe and 15 in China) was sequenced and compared with that of the representative of wild species Anser albifrons. Sequence analysis revealed that thirty-one variable sites and 4 different haplotypes were found among the 45 sequences examined, and nucleotide diversity and haplotype diversity were 0.0068 and 0.45, respectively. Mutations of insertion/deletion were not found. Across all sites,the abundance of G was low (14.2%), whereas the percentages of A, T, and C were quite similar among three Anser goose species. The frequency of guanine differs greatly among the three codon positions. Compositional bias is smaller at first and second positions (0.057 and 0.223) than at third positions (0.492), the probability of transition was higher than that of tranversion (Ts/Tv=9.5-19), there was the highest number of transition in the third codon. The phylogenetic analysis support the hypothesis of dual origin of domestic geese.

The distribution of some enzymes in the organs of the goose was investigated: Creatine-kinase was specific for muscles, Glutamate Dehydrogenase for liver and Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase for pancreas and liver. The production of fatty liver induced an important dilution of liver enzymes except for Lactate Dehydrogenase which was only moderately lowered. This latter enzyme is probably one of the most interesting markers of liver disturbances while fattening is occurring.

The amino acid sequence of the alpha and beta chains from the major hemoglobin component (HbA) of Australian Magpie Goose (Anseranas semipalmata) is given. The minor component with the alpha D chains was detected, but only found in low concentrations. By homologous comparison, Greylag Goose hemoglobin (Anser anser) and Australian Magpie Goose alpha chains differ by 13 amino acids or 17 nucleotide (4 two point mutations) exchanges, beta chains by 6 exchanges. Seven alpha 1 beta 1 contacts are modified by substitutions in positions alpha 30-(B11)Glu leads to Gln, alpha 34(B15)Thr leads to Gln, alpha 35(B16)-Ala leads to Thr, alpha 36(B17)Tyr leads to Phe, beta 55(D6)Leu leads to Ile, beta 119(GH2)Ala leads to Ser and beta 125(H3)Glu leads to Asp. Further, one alpha 1 beta 2 contact point was changed in beta 39(C5)Gln leads to Glu. Mutation in this position, except in two abnormal human hemoglobins, was not found in any species. Amino acid exchanges between hemoglobin of Australian Magpie Goose and other birds are discussed.

Using to analysis of hypervariable fragment polymorphism in the control region of mitochondrial DNA (268 bp), the genetic variability of Swan goose Anser cygnoides L., included in the first category of endangered species in the Russian Red Book, has been investigated. Samples from the two main groups nesting in Russia-the Far Eastern group (Khabarovsk krai, n = 38) and the Dauric group (Chita region, n = 10) were examined. Eleven haplotypes were described. The genetic diversity of Swan geese was low comparable with that observed in some other globally endangered Eurasian goose species. Nucleotide and haplotype diversity of goose from Khabarovsk krai was 0.0031 and 0.65, respectively; in those from Chita region, 0.0041 and 0.80; and for in total group, 0.0074 and 0.77, respectively. No identical haplotypes in Swan goose from Far Eastern and Daurical groups have been demonstrated. However, the small sample size does not allow us to make final conclusions on the degree of genetic differentiation between these groups.

The karyotype of the Italian goose originating from Anser anser was characterised on the basis of R and C bands. Chromosomal preparations obtained from an in vitro culture of blood lymphocytes were stained with the RBG and CBG techniques. The RBG technique enabled the analysis of the structure of nine pairs of chromosomes whereas the CBG technique - fourteen pairs ofchromosomes from the total ofeighty goose chromosomes. The morphology and the R and C banding patterns were described. The size and arrangement of the blocks of constitutive chromatin were determined. Ideograms of R and C banded patterns were drawn. The morphological structure of the analysed chromosomes was evaluated.

A maximum of 22 bands comprising four esterase subgroups--acetylesterase, carboxylesterase, cholinesterase, and acetylcholinesterase--were detected following electrophoresis of lesser snow goose sera on polyacrylamide gels. A minimum of seven structural genes was surmised to be involved in the biosynthesis of these enzymes following physiochemical characterizations. The genetic variability of these loci was calculated to be 1.25% average heterozygosity, while 14.3% of the loci were polymorphic. These estimates of genetic variability were substantially lower than those reported for other vertebrate species. The low degree of genetic variability found in snow goose serum esterases coupled with the extensive protein multiplicity observed may possibly reflect an adaptive strategy based on "biochemical plasticity" rather than genic heterozygosity for this species. The nature of evolutionary forces acting upon multiple enzyme systems such as esterases is discussed. The concept of "conditional neutrality" is introduced and defined within this context.

The alpha- and beta-chains of the main component of hemoglobin of the greylag goose (Anser anser) were isolated. For determination of the primary structure of hemoglobin, the chains were cleaved and the cleavage products isolated. The chains and peptides were degraded automatically in the sequenator: the complete primary structure of the alpha-and beta-chains was obtained and compared with the human adult hemoglobin. Comparison with human sequences show 1 substitutions in the alpha-chain and 44 in beta-chain. The mutations are discussed. The alpha-chains contain no tryptophan, only one methionine and two cysteines. Seven alpha 1 beta 1-contacts and one alpha 1 beta 2-oxy- and deoxy-contact are altered. In the beta-chains two acidic amino acids are eliminated. This is probably the reason for the more basic character of the greylag goose hemoglobin. The contact points of the allosteric effector (inositol pentaphosphate in case of birds, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate in case of mamals) with the beta-chains are identical in chicken and greylag goose, two more than in the human beta-chains. Six alpha 1 beta 1-contacts and one hem-contact are changed. This work forms a basis to allow comparison of the functions of several bird hemoglobins and for further studies of bird hemoglobins and for further studies of evolution and systematics of birds.

1. Haematological values have been determined in 40 goslings, aged 6 to 42 d, and in 86 chickens, aged 1 to 57 d. 2. The erythrocyte number of goslings remained virtually unchanged with age but there was a decrease in the volume of circulating blood when expressed in terms of body weight. 3. In chickens the number of erythrocytes per unit volume increased with age but the size of the erythrocytes diminished with the result that there was an increase in the red blood cell total surface area per unit volume. 4. The haemoglobin content of chicken blood also rose but the haematocrit value and the mead cell haemoglobin concentration remained constant: mean cell haemoglobin decreased significantly. 5. It seems probable that the blood of goslings has a smaller oxygen carrying capability that that of the chicken and this might be reflected with their slower metabolic rate per body weight unit. There are only a few data available on the changes in haematological values of the domestic fowl after hatching (Lange, 1919; Sandreuter, 1951; Lucas and Denington, 1957; Medway and Kare, 1959) and virtually none for the goose. In this paper various haematological values for both species are presented for the first weeks of post-embryonic life.

The ventilatory activity of the anterior and posterior groups of air sacs was simulated in unidirectionally-ventilated geese and the resultant flow of air in the mediodorsal secondary bronchi was used as an indicator of the route which air followed through the lung. The results were used to isolate the roles of the respective groups of air sacs in the shaping of the unidirectional pattern of airflow known to exist during normal respiration. Findings indicated that, in contrast to Hazelhoff's model, the anterior and not the posterior sacs are responsible for producing the caudo-cranial flow of air through the parabronchi during inspiration. The posterior sacs, as predicted by Hazelhoffs model, and primarily responsible for driving the caudo-cranial current through the parabronchi during expiration.

We report the first measurements of heart rate (f(H)) and the rate of oxygen consumption (V(O(2))) during flights from a species of bird larger than 500 g. V(O(2))was obtained from nine forward flapping flights of 8.9 min mean duration at a mean speed of 13.2 m s(-1) performed by three barnacle geese of mean mass 1.68 kg. Mean V(O(2))was 332 ml min(-1)or 201 ml min(-1) kg(-1). Sixteen flights were obtained from two of these birds equipped with heart rate data loggers, both when they were wearing a V(O(2)) mask and when they were not. During flights with the mask (mean duration 7.4 min), mean f(H) was 472 beats per min and during flights without the mask (mean duration 8.0 min) it was 391 beats per min. Heart rate was also measured in another goose flying without a respiratory mask and mean f(H) for all the three birds (mean mass 1.7 kg) flying without a mask for an average of 7.9 min at 13 m s(-1) was 378 beats per min. Resting f(H) for these three birds was 79 beats per min. The values of f(H) during flight are greater than those obtained from the same species during their autumn migration from Spitsbergen to southern Scotland. The possible reasons for this are discussed.

The ultrastructure of the macrogamete stage of Eimeria kotlani has been studied. The peculiarity of this eimerian parasite is that its development procedes within the host cell nucleus. The ultrastructure of the macrogamete of E. kotlani has much in common with that of other eimerians that are localized in the host cell cytoplasm. The differences noticed concern, first of all, the structural organization of wall forming bodies of both types (WF-1, WF-2). The WF-1 are originally arranged around the WF-2, as small electron opaque granules making a dark ring, to move towards the periphery of the macrogamete body with maturation. The WF-2 of E. kotlani macrogametes lack a labyrinth structure so characteristic of WF-2 of macrogametes of other eimerian species. The macrogamete of E. kotlani is limited with three membranes, the innermost membrane is interrupted. Pinocytosis is presumably a mode of the parasite's nutrition. The nutrients are supposed to be transported by vesicles originating from the nucleoplasm of the host cell and limited with two membranes. In result, the remaining nucleoplasm looks as a narrow space of small islets. The host cell cytoplasm reveals some degenerative changes only by the final step of the parasite's development.

The purpose of this study was to determine if DNA fingerprints (DFPs) could be used to estimate relatedness and inbreeding of strains of geese and to compare three methods of calculating relatedness indices. Strains included a control and selected strain from each of the Chinese and Synthetic (Chinese, Hungarian and Pilgrim) breeds. DFP patterns for each strain were based on individual DNA samples from six females, or on pooled DNA from 15 females different from those used for individual samples. Three relatedness indices were used, namely, genetic distance, modified Rogers distance and band sharing. All relatedness indices showed a closer relationship of strains within than between breeds. Correlation coefficients among relatedness indices were higher based on pooled DNA (r > or = magnitude of 0.97) than those based on individual DNA (r > or = magnitude of 0.741). Inbreeding estimates were higher for selected compared with control strains. It appears that the use of DFPs to estimate relatedness, regardless of index used, and inbreeding can be valuable for studying geese where there is a limited breeding history.

To understand the structural basis of avian gas exchange better, we made a morphometric study of domestic and Canada goose lungs. The volume of glutaraldehyde-fixed domestic goose lungs (30 cm3/kg body weight) was similar to that determined from silicone casts of Canada goose lungs by Duncker (33 cm3/kg). To examine finer structures, we rapidly froze goose lungs under physiologic conditions, fixed tissue samples by a freeze substitution procedure and analyzed samples with stereological methods. From light micrographs we determined that about 55% of the lung is parabronchi in both species. Volume densities of air capillaries, blood capillaries and tissue and surface:volume ratios of these same structures were determined from electron micrographs. Our measurements agree with those from glutaraldehyde-fixed Canada goose lungs from other laboratories. Gas exchange surface area was largest in the good flier (Canada goose) but both birds had larger surface areas than comparably sized mammals. The harmonic mean blood-gas barrier thickness is smaller in both species of birds (0.3 microns) than in mammals. Thus, membrane diffusing capacities for gases should be larger in birds than in mammals. Pulmonary blood capillary transit time, as calculated from blood capillary volume and normal levels of cardiac output, are longer in birds than in mammals and should allow more time for blood-gas equilibrium. Pleats and folds were frequently observed in air and blood capillaries, suggesting that the avian lung may not be as rigid as was previously thought and that capillary volumes and surface areas may change under physiologic conditions.

The lungs of 5 wild mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and 5 feral graylag geese (Anser anser) of mean body weight 1.04 and 3.84 kg, respectively, were fixed in situ by intratracheal infusion of 2.3% glutaraldehyde, pH 7.4 and total osmolarity 350 mOsm, at a pressure head of 25 cm, and analysed by standard morphometric techniques. The following data apply to both lungs together, in the fixed state, the first value relating to Anas and the second to Anser in each case: lung volume, 30.4 and 95.3 cm3; volume of exchange tissue, 12.32 and 38.50 cm3; volume of capillary blood, 4.06 and 12.49 cm3; surface area of blood-gas (tissue) barrier per unit body weight, 28.56 and 23.10 cm2/g; surface area of the blood-gas (tissue) barrier per unit volume of lung, 977 and 932 cm2/cm3; surface area of blood-gas (tissue) barrier per unit volume of exchange tissue, 241 and 230 mm2/mm3; harmonic mean thickness of tissue barrier, 0.133 and 0.118 microns; arithmetic mean thickness of tissue barrier, 0.903 and 0.887 microns; harmonic mean thickness of plasma layer, 0.369 and 0.322 microns; mean total morphometric pulmonary diffusing capacity per unit body weight, 3.85 and 3.59 ml O2/min/mm Hg/kg. These morphometric parameters of Anas and Anser are compared with those reported in the literature for the domestic fowl (Gallus gallus), the budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus), the house sparrow (Passer domesticus), and the violet-eared hummingbird (Colibri coruscans). The lungs of these six avian species show progressively advancing adaptations, from Gallus, through Anser, Anas, Melopsittacus and Passer, to Colibri, which appear to be consistent with the energetic characteristics of these birds.

Hand-reared Bar-headed goslings (Anser indicus) were always left alone by the human parent in one room, while in another room the parent was always with them. After 13--22 h of experience in each room and at an age of 4--5 days individual goslings were left alone for 5 min in each room. They uttered significantly fewer distress calls in the room in which they were accustomed to being left alone by the parent. The result is interpreted in terms of environment-dependent calibration of interindividual distances. Such weighted distances are expected to be important variables in the short-term control of attachment behaviour.

In autoradiographs of cryostat sections through the forebrains of domestic geese (Anser anser f. dom.) the distribution of muscarinic ACh-receptors was studied. A regionally varied receptor density is described and compared to histological subdivisions. Possible correlations of receptor pattern and functional systems are discussed.

The activity of three muscles associated with the uncinate processes, (i) external intercostal, (ii) appendicocostalis and (iii) external oblique, were examined using patch and sew-through electrodes during sitting, standing and moderate speed treadmill running in the giant Canada goose. The external intercostal muscles demonstrated no respiratory activity, being active only during running, suggesting they play some role in trunk stabilisation. The appendicocostalis and external oblique muscles are respiratory muscles, being active during inspiration and expiration, respectively. The activity of the appendicocostalis muscles increased during sitting, suggesting that the uncinate processes in birds play an important role in facilitating lateral flaring of the rib cage when sternal rocking is prevented. We suggest that the uncinate processes in birds facilitate movements of the ribs and sternum during breathing and therefore are integral to the breathing mechanics of birds.

Utilising the homology between goose alpha chain hemoglobin and chicken, the primary arrangement of the amino acid residues of the alpha chain (major component) of goose hemoglobin is presented. Data were obtained from amino acid analysis of the isolated alpha chain and of tryptic peptides of the chain. Their chemical structure was established by Edman degradation, carboxypeptidase A and B and leucineaminopeptidase digestion.

The fine structure of macrogametes of a goose coccidium Tyzzeria parvula has been studied, intranuclear localization of these being discovered. Unlike other coccidia, macrogametes of T. parvula display only one type of wall-forming bodies. Deep invaginations are formed on the surface of macrogametes, in which fragments of host cell nucleoplasm, separated with the membrane of parasitophorous vacuole, are invaginating. They may be connected with process of parasite's feeding.

This paper examines the principal classes of repetitive DNA of the Toulouse goose (Anser anser) genome. There are four major classes and they are tandem repeats of less than 200 base pairs (bp). The longest repeat (class A) is 190 bp long and starts with a HinfI site. Class B is 43 bp long, commencing with a FokI site. Classes A and B show no extensive homology to DNA sequences held on a current data base (Genbank) but were confirmed to exist as major repeats in another strain of goose, the Emden goose (Anser anser) genome. Classes C and D are 5-bp repeats of 5' GAGAG 3' and 5' GGGAA 3', respectively. The macrosatellites C and D were compared with a current data base (Genbank) and were found to exist in a variety of other organisms as satellites.

The amino acid sequences of the alpha- and beta-chains from the major hemoglobin component (HbA) of Canada goose (Branta canadensis) and mute swan (Cygnus olor) are given. The alpha-chains are of the alpha A-type, since alpha D-type was expressed but only found in low concentrations. By homologous comparison, greylag goose hemoglobin (Anser anser) and Canada goose hemoglobin alpha-chains differ by two exchanges, and beta-chains by three exchanges. A valine substitution for threonine was found at position alpha 34 (B15). This exchange is a result of a two point mutation. Thus, there are three nucleotide mutations in alpha-chains, as in beta-chains. Substitutions in positions alpha 34 (B15) and beta 125 (H3) have modified intersubunit contacts (alpha 1 beta 1-contacts). A comparison of mute swan hemoglobin with greylag goose hemoglobin shows four exchanges in alpha-chains and three in beta-chains. Canada goose and mute swan have identical beta-chains, while alpha-chains differ in two amino acids. One of these exchanges is implicated in one of the alpha 1 beta 1-contact points (alpha 34) where isoleucine substitution for valine was found. Comparison of hemoglobins from different species in the same tribe (Anserini) shows a high homology between Canada goose and mute swan hemoglobins.

The development of the locomotory muscles and associated skeletal structures of goslings and adults from a captive population of barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) was compared with that from a wild migratory population. There was no significant difference between flight-muscle development of wild and captive goslings up to 7 wk of age, when the birds are first able to fly. In contrast, mass-specific citrate-synthase activity in the semimembranosus leg muscle of the captive goslings was significantly lower than that of wild goslings by 5 wk of age. During the postfledging premigratory period, captive geese showed significantly higher values for both mass and mass-specific citrate-synthase activity of the leg muscles than those of wild birds. Premigratory wild geese had significantly higher citrate-synthase activity in the pectoralis muscles and larger cardiac ventricular mass (by ca. 20%-25%) than both wild postmoulting and captive premigratory adults. Total flight-muscle mass was only slightly reduced (by ca. 10%) in long-term captive adults compared with wild premigratory adults. Most of the differences between these two populations appear primarily to reflect their relative levels of activity and/or differences in their ambient environment, rather than any intrinsic differences in developmental or adult physiology.

The non-reversing gas flow pattern in the avian lung has been attributed to 'aerodynamic valves'. A fundamental property of all aerodynamic valves is their dependence on inertial forces in the gas stream: sufficient reduction of inertial forces will cause aerodynamic valves to fail. If valving in the avian lung is aerodynamic, it should fail when gas stream momentum is reduced. We tested the dependence of the inspiratory valves in the goose lung on gas density and gas flow velocity. A bolus of tracer gas was placed in the tracheal cannula during an end-expiratory pause. Tracer gas appearance in a cranial air sac during the following inspiration and pause was used to deduce failure of the 'inspiratory valve' in cyclically ventilated geese. Little or no tracer entered the sac under control conditions, which approximated resting breathing, indicating highly effective valving. Lower flow rate or lower gas density caused increased tracer appearance, indicating valve failure. These results demonstrate the importance of gas inertial forces to normal valve function, and are direct evidence for the aerodynamic nature of the avian inspiratory valve.

We report here the results of the sequence and structure analysis of mitochondrial tRNApro and tRNAthr genes in domestic goose breeds by sequencing the mitochondrial DNA from a total of 25 samples from 6 breeds of Chinese geese and 2 breeds of domestic Europe geese. Sequences and the cloverleaf structure of tRNApro (69 bp) and tRNAthr (68 bp) in domestic goose breeds were described and analysed They were compared amongst the three domestic goose breeds as well as between Anseriformes (Anser cygnoides) and Galliformes (Gallus gallus domesticus, Genbank accession number NC001323). Both goose tRNApro and tRNAthr genes have normal cloverleaf secondary structures. The amino acid arm and the anticodon loop of the cloverleaf structure of tRNApro and tRNAthr are very conservative among Anser albifrons, Anser anser and Anser cygnoides. The gene sequences in this study were deposited to GenBank under accession numbers AY427800-AY427805 and AY427812-AY427814.

Population structure and phylogeography of the pink-footed goose, Anser brachyrhynchus Baillon 1833, was studied using mtDNA control region sequences (221 bp) from 142 individuals. Present breeding areas of the species in Greenland, Iceland, and Svalbard were largely covered by ice during the late Pleistocene. In pairwise comparisons phiST estimates showed significant differentiation among eastern and western populations, whereas sampling localities within both areas were not differentiated. The mtDNA data indicate that the populations have separated recently (less than 10 000 years ago) and present breeding areas were colonized from one refugial population. The levels of haplotype and nucleotide diversity were approximately five times higher for the eastern population compared to the western population and suggest that the latter was colonized by a subset of eastern birds. Time to the most recent common ancestor of the species is 32 000-46 000 years, i.e. the present mtDNA variation of the pink-footed goose has accumulated during the last 0.1 My. Estimates of the long-term female effective population size (5400-7700 for the eastern population) imply that the refugial population of the pink-footed goose has been large. Tundra habitats were more extensive in cold periods of the late Pleistocene than today and may have sustained population sizes that allowed the accumulation of extant genetic polymorphism. It is not probable that the postulated small refugial areas in the high latitudes had a significant role in maintaining this diversity.

1. Effects of general body cooling on heat production: an intravascular heat exchanger was used to alter total body temperature. Heat production increased with decreasing body temperature at an average rate of -12W/kg x degree C. The rate of rise was independent of air temperature. The threshold body temperature below which heat production rose was lower at higher air temperature. 2. Effects of spinal cord cooling: heat production increased with decreasing spinal temperature at an average rate of -0.3 W/kg x degree C. The rate of rise was not clearly affected by air temperature. The spinal threshold temperature was lower at warm ambient conditions. The results suggest that spinal thermosensitivity in the goose represents only a minor fraction of total body thermosensitivity. 3. Effects of head cooling: heat exchangers closing the carotid arteries were used to alter the temperature of the blood supplied to the head. Cooling increased heat production. When the thermosensitivity of the area, which was affected by heat exchanger, was calculated from the relationship between changes of heat production and brain temperature, values between -0.74 and -1.65 W/kg x degree C were obtained. Measurements of brain, spinal cord and head skin temperatures suggest that the thermosensitive structures which mediated the responses, were predominantly situated in the brain.

RAPD markers often primers were used to assess the polymorphism among pooled DNA of eight goose lines. The number of bands amplified by each primer ranged from 1 to 8, within a mean of 2.86. Some bands appeared specific for the line or genetic background. RAPD technique is an effective method for generating the polymorphic DNA marker in the goose. RAPD patterns from mixed DNA samples can reflect the genetic information of populations. The present study indicated that 10 generations selected for egg production and body weight under various pressure, resulted in genetic variation among goose lines as detected by RAPD. Selection for meat traits caused greater genetic diversity than selection for egg production.

We studied the effects of grazing by Black Brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) geese (hereafter Brant) on plant community zonation and gosling growth between 1987 and 2000 at a nesting colony in southwestern Alaska. The preferred forage of Brant, Carex subspathacea, is only found as a grazing lawn. An alternate forage species, C. ramenskii, exists primarily as meadow but also forms grazing lawns when heavily grazed. We mowed plots of ungrazed C. ramenskii meadows to create swards that Brant could select and maintain as grazing lawns. Fecal counts were higher on mowed plots than on control plots in the year after plots were mowed. Both nutritional quality and aboveground biomass of C. ramenskii in mowed plots were similar to that of C. subspathacea grazing lawns. The areal extent of grazing lawns depends in part on the population size of Brant. High Brant populations can increase the areal extent of grazing lawns, which favors the growth of goslings. Grazing lawns increased from 3% to 8% of surface area as the areal extent of C. ramenskii meadows declined between 1991 and 1999. Gosling mass was lower early in this time period due to density dependent effects. As the goose population stabilized, and area of grazing lawns increased, gosling mass increased between 1993 and 1999. Because larger goslings have increased survival, higher probability of breeding, and higher fecundity, herbivore-mediated changes in the distribution grazing lawn extent may result in a numerical increase of the population within the next two decades.

Under conditions of progressive hypoxia, oxygen transport was compared in bar-headed geese (Anser indicus), a species which breeds on the Tibetan Plateau and migrates at altitudes up to 9200 m, and Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos, forma domestica), a similarly sized, sea-level water fowl that does not fly. Pekin ducks showed no altitude-induced behavioral effects (e.g., restlessness) up to 7620 m, while bar-headed geese tolerated 10,668 m with no observable behavioral changes. Ventilatory and cardiac responses to hypoxia as functions of PaO2 followed a typical hyperbolic contour, but the response began at almost 20 Torr lower in the bar-headed goose. Both ventilation and cardiac output appeared to follow a common response curve for the two species, when the independent variable was expressed as arterial oxygen content. The goose had a high oxygen affinity hemoglobin, compared with the duck; the oxyhemoglobin curves of both shifted slightly to the right as a result of acclimation to 5640 m; but only the duck developed erythrocytosis as a consequence of acclimation. Under sea level conditions the duck maintained a higher mixed venous PO2, but with acute hypoxic exposures PVO2 was higher in the goose. Following acclimation, cardiac output in the duck was lower than in pre-acclimatized state, but in the goose it was higher up to the altitude at which it migrates. The selective pressures leading to the evolution of favorable oxygen transport in the bar-headed goose are discussed.

The central localisation of responses to stimulation of different peripheral somatic areas was studied in anaesthetised geese of the Landes breed. Natural (light touch, tap) and electrical stimuli were applied. In the first experiments the changes in the spontaneous activity following natural stimuli were recorded systematically from different brain regions. In the following experiments evoked potentials were recorded from responsive sites. The majority of the somatic responses were localised in the paleostriatum augmentatum, the neostriatum and the neostriatum caudale. Stimulation of the bill and the head elicited responses in tractus quinto-frontalis, paleostriatum augmentatum, neostriatum and neostriatum caudale while activation from the body were mainly localised in neostriatum caudale and paleostriatum augmentatum. Responses to photic stimulation were recorded from the visual wulst, the stratum opticum and the nucleus rotundus. Auditory stimuli were found to be ineffective under our recording conditions. These results are discussed and compared with previous data obtained in other species.

The effects of passive wing flapping on respiratory pattern were examined in decerebrate Canada geese. The birds were suspended dorsally with two spine clamps while the extended wings were continuously moved up and down with a device designed to reproduce actual wing flapping. Passive wing motion entrained respiration over limited ranges by both increasing and decreasing the respiratory period relative to rest. All ratios of wingbeat frequency to respiratory frequency seen during free flight (Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 15: 391, 1989) were produced during passive wing flapping. In addition, the phase relationship between wingbeat frequency and respiratory frequency, inspiration starting near the peak of wing upstroke, was similar to that seen during free flight and was unaffected by perturbations of the wing-flapping cycle. Removal of all afferent activity from the wings did not affect the ability of continuous passive wing movement to entrain respiration. However, feedback from the wings was required to produce rapid within-breath shifts in the respiratory period in response to single wing flaps. In conclusion, although feedback from the chest wall/lung may be more important in producing entrainment during the stable conditions of passive wing flapping, wing-related feedback may be critically involved in mediating the rapid adjustments in respiratory pattern required to maintain coordination between wing and respiratory movements during free flight.

Electrical activity of trigeminal central projection areas was recorded in anesthetized and chronic awake geese. Evoked potentials of telencephalic structures were studied after stimulation of the bill, quintofrontal tract (QF), and several telencephalic structures (nucleus basalis [Bas], neostriatum frontale [NF], paleostriatum augmentatum [PA], and neostriatum caudale [NC]). Short-latency evoked potentials were recorded in Bas after stimulation of the bill or QF; this finding is consistent with a direct connection between the main sensory trigeminal nucleus and Bas. Short- and long-latency evoked potentials were recorded in PA and NC after stimulation of the posterior QF. These potentials are concluded to be due to two different pathways: The shorter-latency response is produced by fibers leaving QF posteriorly, while the longer-latency response is derived from fibers traveling along QF, relaying first in Bas and then in NF. From Bas and NF, two pathways convey impulses to NC; only one is relayed in PA.

The changes in the serum level of free fatty acids (FFA) in the migratory Canada goose (Branta canadensis interior) breeding in Ft. Churchill (Manitoba, Canada) and wintering in Swan Lake (Missouri, U.S.A.), were studied during the different periods of its yearly life cycle. The lowest serum FFA level was noted during the spring premigratory phase (early March) at Swan Lake, and the highest during moult (early August) at Ft. Churchill. Serum FFA level during the spring postmigratory period (early May at Ft. Churchill) was significantly higher than that during the spring premigratory period and the breeding period (early at Ft. Churchill). No signigicant difference in FFA levels was noted between the fall premigratory (early September at Ft. Churchill) and the fall postmigratory (mid-October at Swan Lake) periods. The significance of the seasonal variations in serum FFA level is discussed in relation to the cyclic physiological events taking place in the bird.

Clostridium septicum infection causing 5.0 to 5.2% mortality is reported for the first time in the literature from six-week-old growing geese in three flocks comprising 5,200, 5,500 and 5,900 geese, respectively. The affected birds exhibited weakness, uncoordinated movement, ataxia and, frequently, oblique position of the head and neck (torticollis) as well as signs indicative of dysequilibrium. The affected birds died within 18-24 h. Gross pathological examination revealed anaemia, hepatitis with map-like necroses of irregular outline (Fig. 1), acute enteritis, pulmonary oedema and cardiac dilatation. Light and electron-microscopic examination showed that the sinusoids of the liver were markedly dilated (Fig. 2) and filled with serous exudate and gas (Figs 2 and 3), and the hepatocytes surrounding them exhibited severe oedema (Fig. 4). Among the hepatocytes, ciliated bacteria 7-10 mu in length and 1-3 mu in width, bounded by a well-defined cell wall and often showing signs of spore formation were observed (Figs 5 and 6). By bacteriological examination the pathogen was isolated, its properties were studied, and the clinical entity of malignant oedema was experimentally reproduced by intramuscular injection of guinea-pigs and rabbits. The applied antibiotic (oxytetracycline) and furazolidone therapy proved effective.

A putative old and ubiquitous interspersed DNA repeat family was identified from TaqI restriction, M13 cloning, and sequencing of the genomic DNA of a Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), a Muscovy Duck (Cairina moschata), a Toulouse Goose (Anser anser), and a Black Swan (Cygnus atratus). A 425-bp consensus core sequence was obtained for the interspersed family. The 425-bp unit was about 2% of the avian genome and was found to be conserved in at least four genera of the order Anseriforme: Anas, Anser, Cairina, and Cygnus.

Goose parvovirus (GPV) infection can cause a highly contagious and lethal disease in goslings and muscovy ducklings which is widespread in all major goose (Anser anser) and Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata) farming countries, leading to a huge economic loss. Humoral immune responses play a major role in GPV immune protection during GPV infection. However, it is still unknown for the localization and immunological characteristics of B-cell epitopes on GPV non-structural protein (NSP). Therefore, in this study, the epitopes on the NSP of GPV were identified by means of overlapping peptides expressed in Escherichia coli in combination with Western blot. The results showed that the antigenic epitopes on the GPV NSP were predominantly localized in the C-terminal (aa 485-627), and especially, the fragment NS (498-532) was strongly positive. These results may facilitate future investigations on the function of NSP of GPV and the development of immunoassays for the diagnosis of GPV infection.

Bar-headed geese (Anser indicus) fly at up to 9,000 m elevation during their migration over the Himalayas, sustaining high metabolic rates in the severe hypoxia at these altitudes. We investigated the evolution of cardiac energy metabolism and O(2) transport in this species to better understand the molecular and physiological mechanisms of high-altitude adaptation. Compared with low-altitude geese (pink-footed geese and barnacle geese), bar-headed geese had larger lungs and higher capillary densities in the left ventricle of the heart, both of which should improve O(2) diffusion during hypoxia. Although myoglobin abundance and the activities of many metabolic enzymes (carnitine palmitoyltransferase, citrate synthase, 3-hydroxyacyl-coA dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, and pyruvate kinase) showed only minor variation between species, bar-headed geese had a striking alteration in the kinetics of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the heteromeric enzyme that catalyzes O(2) reduction in oxidative phosphorylation. This was reflected by a lower maximum catalytic activity and a higher affinity for reduced cytochrome c. There were small differences between species in messenger RNA and protein expression of COX subunits 3 and 4, but these were inconsistent with the divergence in enzyme kinetics. However, the COX3 gene of bar-headed geese contained a nonsynonymous substitution at a site that is otherwise conserved across vertebrates and resulted in a major functional change of amino acid class (Trp-116 → Arg). This mutation was predicted by structural modeling to alter the interaction between COX3 and COX1. Adaptations in mitochondrial enzyme kinetics and O(2) transport capacity may therefore contribute to the exceptional ability of bar-headed geese to fly high.

The connectedness in Arctic regions between migratory waterbird populations originating from different continents and the potential for virus exchange at their shared Arctic breeding ground point to the need to explore the largely unstudied circumpolar circulation of avian influenza viruses (AIV). We here report the investigation of AIV in wild birds and lakes in a high Arctic area of Northeast Greenland. No AIV could be detected in the fecal, feather, and water samples collected from large flocks of pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus and barnacle geese Branta leucopsis in and around refuge lakes, where they congregate at high density during their flightless molting period in summer.

CD8 molecule is a cell membrane glycoprotein, which plays an important role in cell-mediated immunity. Here, we identified Chinese goose CD8α (goCD8α) gene for the first time. The full-length cDNA of goCD8α is 1459bp in length and contains a 711bp open reading frame. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the waterfowl CD8α formed a monophyletic group. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that transcripts of goCD8α mRNA were high in the immune-related organs and mucosal immune system in gosling, and high in thymus and spleen comparing to other immune-related tissues in goose. The obvious increase of CD8α expression was observed in spleen of acute new type gosling viral enteritis virus (NGVEV) infected bird, while the increase of CD8α were observed in the thymus, bursa of fabricius, and cecum of chronic infected bird. The CD8α mRNA transcription level in spleen mononuclear cells was significantly up-regulated when stimulated by phytohemagglutinin, but not by lipopolysaccharide in vitro.

The advancement of spring and the differential ability of organisms to respond to changes in plant phenology may lead to "phenological mismatches" as a result of climate change. One potential for considerable mismatch is between migratory birds and food availability in northern breeding ranges, and these mismatches may have consequences for ecosystem function. We conducted a three-year experiment to examine the consequences for CO2 exchange of advanced spring green-up and altered timing of grazing by migratory Pacific black brant in a coastal wetland in western Alaska. Experimental treatments represent the variation in green-up and timing of peak grazing intensity that currently exists in the system. Delayed grazing resulted in greater net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and gross primary productivity (GPP), while early grazing reduced CO2 uptake with the potential of causing net ecosystem carbon (C) loss in late spring and early summer. Conversely, advancing the growing season only influenced ecosystem respiration (ER), resulting in a small increase in ER with no concomitant impact on GPP or NEE. The experimental treatment that represents the most likely future, with green-up advancing more rapidly than arrival of migratory geese, results in NEE changing by 1.2 µmol m-2  s-1 toward a greater CO2 sink in spring and summer. Increased sink strength, however, may be mitigated by early arrival of migratory geese, which would reduce CO2 uptake. Importantly, while the direct effect of climate warming on phenology of green-up has a minimal influence on NEE, the indirect effect of climate warming manifest through changes in the timing of peak grazing can have a significant impact on C balance in northern coastal wetlands. Furthermore, processes influencing the timing of goose migration in the winter range can significantly influence ecosystem function in summer habitats.

The goose (Anser cygnoides), having high nutritional value, high-quality feathers and high economic benefit, is an economically important poultry species. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the higher susceptibility to pathogens in goslings than in adult geese remains poorly understood. In this study, the histological sections of spleen tissue from a two-week-old gosling and an adult goose, respectively, were subjected to comparative analysis. The spleen of gosling was mainly composed of mesenchyma, accompanied by scattered lymphocytes, whereas the spleen parenchyma was well developed in the adult goose. To investigate goose immune-related genes, we performed deep transcriptome and gene expression analyses of the spleen samples using paired-end sequencing technology (Illumina). In total, 50,390 unigenes were assembled using Trinity software and TGICL software. Moreover, these assembled unigenes were annotated with gene descriptions and gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed. Through Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) analysis, we investigated 558 important immune-relevant unigenes and 23 predicted cytokines. In addition, 22 immune-related genes with differential expression between gosling and adult goose were identified, among which the three genes showing largest differences in expression were immunoglobulin alpha heavy chain (IgH), mannan-binding lectin serine protease 1 isoform X1 (MASP1) and C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4). Finally, of these 22 differentially expressed immune-related genes, seven genes, including tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 13B (TNFRSF13B), C-C motif chemokine 4-like (CCL4), CXCR4, interleukin 2 receptor alpha (IL2RA), MHC class I heavy chain (MHCIα), transporter of antigen processing 2 (TAP2) IgH, were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The expression levels of all the candidate unigenes were up-regulated in adult geese other than that of TNFRSF13B. The comparative analysis of the spleen transcriptomes of gosling and adult goose may promote better understanding of immune molecular development in goose.

The skin is a natural target of stem cell research because of its large size and easy accessibility. Cutaneous mesenchymal stem cells have shown to be a promising source of various adult stem cell or progenitor cell populations, which provide an important source of stem cell-based investigation. Nowadays, much work has been done on dermal-derived mesenchymal stem cells (DMSCs) from humans, mice, sheep, and other mammals, but the literature on avian species has been rarely reported. As an animal model, the goose is an endemic species abounding in dermal tissues which is important in the global economy. In this study, we isolated and established the mesenchymal stem cell line from dermis tissue of goose, which were subcultured to passage 21 in vitro without loss of their functional integrity in terms of morphology, renewal capacity, and presence of mesenchymal stem cell markers. Cryopreservation and resuscitation were also observed in different passages. To investigate the biological characteristics of goose DMSCs, immunofluorescence, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and flow cytometry were used to detect the characteristic surface markers. Growth curves and the capacity of colony forming were performed to test the self-renew and proliferative ability. Furthermore, the DMSCs are induced to osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes in vitro. Our results suggest that DMSCs isolated from goose embryos possess similar biological characteristics to those from other species. The methods in establishment and cultivation of goose DMSCs line demonstrated a good self-renew and expansion potential in vitro, which provided a technological platform for preserving the valuable genetic resources of poultry and a great inspiration for in vitro investigation of avian MSCs.

The occurrence of avian influenza has brought attention to migrating birds and their migratory routes as possible carriers and gates, respectively, of the pathogenic influenza virus. There is a need to verify migration routes and to back-track the migration routes of infected animals. Stable isotope analysis of bird feathers is a valuable tool for studying the migratory pattern of birds, by gaining information about the environmental conditions during the growth of the feathers. Ideally, if different feathers that have grown during different periods are investigated, not only can information about the molting region be extracted, but also some clues can be obtained about stop-overs during the migration of individual animals, enabling the reconstruction of the pathway. In the presented case study the hydrogen, carbon nitrogen and sulfur stable isotope ratios of different types of feathers (primaries, down feathers and blood pinfeathers) from one white-fronted goose specimen have been determined. These ratios differ significantly for some elements. By taking into account the different time of growth of the respective feathers, the isotope data can be interpreted with respect to the animal migration route from the summer (and molting) to the wintering region. This is the first paper to attempt to map the migration pathway using different types of feather from a single individual.

In small and declining populations levels of genetic variability are expected to be reduced due to effects of inbreeding and random genetic drift. As a result, both individual fitness and populations' adaptability can be compromised, and the probability of extinction increased. Therefore, maintenance of genetic variability is a crucial goal in conservation biology. Here we show that although the level of genetic variability in mtDNA of the endangered Fennoscandian lesser white-fronted goose Anser erythropus population is currently lower than in the neigbouring populations, it has increased six-fold during the past 140 years despite the precipitously declining population. The explanation for increased genetic diversity in Fennoscandia appears to be recent spontaneous increase in male immigration rate equalling 0.56 per generation. This inference is supported by data on nuclear microsatellite markers, the latter of which show that the current and the historical Fennoscandian populations are significantly differentiated (F(ST) = 0.046, P = 0) due to changes in allele frequencies. The effect of male-mediated gene flow is potentially dichotomous. On the one hand it may rescue the Fennoscandian lesser white-fronted goose from loss of genetic variability, but on the other hand, it eradicates the original genetic characteristics of this population.

Direct pressure measurements using electronic differential pressure transducers along bird wings provide insight into the aerodynamics of these dynamically varying aerofoils. Acceleration-compensated pressures were measured at five sites distributed proximally to distally from the tertials to the primaries along the wings of Canada geese. During take-off flight, ventral-to-dorsal pressure is maintained at the proximal wing section throughout the wingstroke cycle, whereas pressure sense is reversed at the primaries during upstroke. The distal sites experience double pressure peaks during the downstroke. These observations suggest that tertials provide weight-support throughout the wingbeat, that the wingtip provides thrust during upstroke and that the kinetic energy of the rapidly flapping wings may be dissipated via retarding aerodynamic forces (resulting in aerodynamic work) at the end of downstroke.

Raw and smoked (spickgans) fillets of oat-fattened White Kołuda® goose were packed in: PET - ethylene terephthalate bags; VSP - 99% vacuum; MAP1 - 80% O2, 20% CO2; MAP2 - 70% N2, 30% O2; MAP3 - 30% O2, 40% N2, 30% CO2, and stored at a temperature of 2°C. On the day of packaging (0 d) and during storage of raw (5, 7, 10 d) and smoked fillets (5, 10, 15 d), the samples were analyzed for weight losses, physicochemical traits, and chemical composition. The study demonstrated the effect of storage time and packaging method on storage yield of raw and smoked fillets. In VSP, the raw fillets were characterized by the lowest amount of leakage, whereas spickgans were characterized by the highest storage yield and weight loss. The analysis of the effect of the modified atmosphere demonstrated the lowest weight loss of raw fillets at, simultaneously, the smallest amount of leakage in MAP1. The spickgans stored in MAP2 showed higher weight, higher yield after storage, and lower storage loss in all terms of analyses compared to MAP1 and MAP3. The greatest cooking loss at simultaneously the lowest pH values was determined for the samples stored in VSP. The WBSF values of raw fillets were decreasing along with storage time, in contrast to WBSF values of spickgans, in which case the value of this parameter increased compared to 0 d. Raw fillets stored in MAP1 and MAP3 were characterized by the most significant increase in the value of L*, by a decrease in the value of a* and an increase in that of b* parameter. Visual assessment of spickgans on 15 d of storage revealed the presence of white sediment on the surface of products, except for the samples stored in VSP. The study demonstrated the effect of storage time on the contents of protein and fat in raw fillets and on the contents of salt and fat in spickgans.

Activity of kidney and liver carnosinase and concentration of carnosine in leg muscles were determined for 8 weeks in old geese of three races: Italian white, Bilgoraj and Lublin. significant differences were noted between the three races with respect to all parameters under study. the following correlations were found: 1. Between live goose weight and carnosine concentration in muscles (r= 0.5276). 2. Between weight of leg muscles and carnosine level in these muscles (r=0.4912). 3. Between liver weight and carnosine level in muscles (r= 0.3292). 4. Between kidney carnosinase activity and liver carnosinase activity (r= .2104). 5. Between liver carnosinase activity and carnosine level (r= 0.2280). 6. Between kidney carnosinase activity and carnosine level (r= -0.1675). 7. Between the ratio of kidney:liver carnosinase activity and carnosine level in muscles (r =0.1816).

To investigate possible physiologic mechanisms that allow the bar-headed goose to perform strenuous physical activity when flying at high altitude (e.g., above 9,000 m), we measured cardiopulmonary variables during running exercise (treadmill; 0.6 m.sec-1; 2 degrees incline) while the bird breathed either normoxic (21% O2) or hypoxic (7% O2) gases via a face mask. 1. During normoxic exercise, O2 uptake rate doubled and both ventilation and cardiac output increased. Blood gases and pH in arterial, mixed venous and blood from the leg, however, remained virtually unaltered. 2. Hypoxia at rest stimulated ventilation to rise but not cardiac output. The birds reached a steady state with virtually unaltered O2 uptake. 3. Exercise during hypoxia further stimulated ventilation, resulting in elevated arterial PO2 and O2 content compared to hypoxia at rest. However, O2 uptake increased only slightly, and cardiac output did not rise over the resting hypoxic value. The hyperventilation resulted in respiratory alkalosis and increased CO2 output, with R values being as high as 2.0. 4. It is concluded that neither ventilation nor pulmonary gas transfer were the limiting step in supplying O2 to the working muscles during hypoxic exercise in our experiments. It is more likely that muscle blood flow or diffusion from muscle capillaries to mitochondria, or both, determined the aerobic capacity under these conditions.

The Arctic is undergoing rapid changes, with anthropogenic shifts in climate having important and well-documented impacts on habitat. Populations of predators and their prey are affected by changing climate and other anthropogenic factors, and these changing trophic interactions could have profound effects on breeding populations of Arctic birds. Variable abundance of lemmings (a primary prey of generalist Arctic predators) and increasing abundance of light geese (Lesser Snow and Ross' Geese; a secondary prey) could have negative consequences for numerous sympatric shorebirds (an incidental prey). Using 16 years of predator-prey observations and 13-years of shorebird nest survival data at a site near a goose colony we identify relationships among geese, lemmings, and their shared predators and then relate predator indices to shorebird risk of nest predation. During two years, we also placed time-lapse cameras and artificial shorebird nests at increasing distances from a goose colony to document spatial trends in predators and their effect on risk of predation. In the long-term data, yearly indices of light geese positively influenced indices of gulls and jaegers, and shorebird nest predation rate was negatively correlated with jaeger and fox indices. All three predator indices were highest near the goose colony and artificial nest predation probability was negatively correlated with distance from goose colony, but these effects were less apparent during the second year. Combined, these results highlight the variation in predator-mediated interactions between geese and shorebirds and outline one mechanism by which hyperabundant geese may be contributing to local or regional declines in Arctic-nesting shorebird populations.

In order to avoid interference from nuclear copies of mitochondrial DNA (numts), mtDNA of the white Roman goose (domestic goose) was extracted from liver mitochondria. The mtDNA control region was amplified using a long PCR strategy and then sequenced. Neighbor-joining, maximum parsimony, and maximum-likelihood approaches were implemented using the 1,177 bp mtDNA control region sequences to compute the phylogenetic relationships of the domestic goose with other geese. The resulting identity values for the white Roman geese were 99.1% (1,166/1,177) with western graylag geese and 98.8% (1,163/1,177) with eastern graylag geese. In molecular phylogenetic trees, the white Roman goose was grouped in the graylag lineage, indicating that the white Roman goose came from the graylag goose (Anser anser). Thus, the scientific name of the white Roman goose should be Anser anser 'White Roman.'

Flagellates from the caeca of a diseased hen and a diseased goose were transmitted to 35 specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens. The flagellates of chicken origin were identified as Chilomastix gallinarum, Tritrichomonas eberthi, and Tetratrichomonas gallinarum. T. eberthi was not detected in the material of goose origin. Morphologic studies did not reveal any differences between Chilomastix and Tetratrichomonas specimens from chicken or goose origin. The species from the goose were identified as C. gallinarum and T. gallinarum (Syn. T. anseris Hegner, 1929). Both trichomonad species produced pseudocysts that developed in the faeces of chickens within 3 h after excretion. Only 17% of the trichomonads excreted had reached the pseudocyst stage. All three flagellate species are infective to chickens when inoculated per rectum or per os or when consumed with chlorinated tap water. The prepatency period was always less than 24 h. SPF chickens between 2 and 30 days of age were equally susceptible. The infections persisted at a high level of intensity throughout the observation periods, i.e. up to 7 months. Of 35 inoculated SPF chickens, 2 developed disease (emaciation, ruffled feathers, diarrhoea, dilatation of the caeca). The three flagellate species were cultivated in Diamond's medium for 110 days. Cryopreserved and cultivated flagellates retained their infectivity to chickens.

Tissue capillarity in the gastrocnemius and myoglobin concentrations in the gastrocnemius and heart were determined for hatchling Canada geese, Branta canadensis, following incubation of the embryos under either normoxic (Po2 = 120 torr) or hypoxic (Po2 = 94 torr) conditions. Similar observations were made on a limited number of hatchling bar-headed geese, Anser indicus, a species native to high altitude. Capillary densities were higher and diffusion distances shorter in the hypoxic Canada geese and the bar-headed geese than in the normoxic Canada geese. The concentrations of myoglobin in the heart and gastrocnemius increased with mass, but not as a function of hypoxia. We conclude that bird embryos respond to hypoxia by increasing capillarity. The increased capillarity is found in species native to high altitude when incubated under conditions of normoxia and can be induced in species native to sea level by exposure to hypoxia during development.

The aim of this trial was to study the effects of substitution of yellow corn with sorghum during the growing-finishing (G period), overfeeding (O period), or both periods on magret and foie gras quality in geese. In total, 260 ganders were divided into 4 groups (65 birds in each) differing in the cereal (yellow corn or sorghum) included in the diet given during the G and the O periods, using a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. The groups differed in the nature of the cereal in the diet offered to birds between 44 and 104 d of age (G period: a diet containing 500 g of sorghum/kg (SS and SC groups) or a diet containing 500 g of yellow corn/kg (CS and CC groups). The groups differed also in the diet offered to birds between 105 and 120 d of age (O period): 967 g of yellow corn/kg (SC and CC groups) or 965 g of sorghum/kg (SS and CS groups). At the end of the O period, the birds were slaughtered after 10 h of fasting to measure foie gras and breast muscle weight, color, and chemical composition. The mortality in the SC group was higher (P < 0.05) than in the other 3 groups (14.29 vs. 3.58%, average of the 3 groups). After overfeeding, birds fed with sorghum had foie gras that were heavier 984 vs. 885 g, in CS+SS vs. CC+SC groups, respectively; P < 0.001) and less yellow (18.03 vs. 23.97 for b*, in CS+SS vs. CC+SC groups, respectively, P < 0.001) than birds fed with corn. The substitution of yellow corn with sorghum during the G and O periods (SS group) increased the weight of the foie gras, but altered its color to a paler yellow. In contrast, a substitution during the G period only (SC group) resulted in increased mortality during the O period.

Constitutive heterochromatin is a highly condensed fraction of chromatin in chromosomes. It is characterized by a high degree of polymorphism. Heterochromatin is located in the centromeric, telomeric, and interstitial parts of chromosomes. We used the CBG ( C: banding using B: arium hydroxide by G: iemsa) staining technique to identify heterochromatin in chromosomes. Analysis of karyotypes of F1 hybrids resulting from intergeneric hybridization of ducks (A. platyrhynchos × C. moschata) and interspecific crosses of geese (A. anser × A. cygnoides) were used to compare the karyotypes of 2 species of duck and 2 species of geese, as well as to compare the hybrids with the parent species. The localization of C-bands and their size were determined. In the duck hybrid, greater amounts of heterochromatin were noted in the homologous chromosomes from the duck A. platyrhynchos than in the chromosomes from the duck C. moschata. In the goose hybrid more heterochromatin was observed in the homologous chromosomes from the goose A. cygnoides than in the chromosomes from the goose A. anser. Comparison of chromosomes from the duck hybrid with chromosomes of the ducks A. platyrhynchos and C. moschata revealed nearly twice as much constitutive heterochromatin in the chromosomes of the hybrid. When chromosomes from the goose hybrid were compared with those of the geese A. anser and A. cygnoides, differences in the average content of heterochromatin were observed on only a few chromosomes.

Reduction in reproductive potential of ganders with progress in seasonal breeding is a known problem in commercial geese production. The role of changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-gondal axis and testis functions in this process is not clear. This article presents studies on the hypothalamic (GnRH-I, vasoactive intestinal peptide), pituitary (LHβ, prolactin [PRL], PRL receptor [PRLR]), testis (PRLR) axis messenger RNA (mRNA) expression during different stages of the breeding period and photoperiodic conditions. Testis mass; histologic and functional (testosterone [T]) parameters; and plasma concentrations of T, LH, and PRL were evaluated. We collected (six times) samples from 2-year-old ganders (n = 48) maintained in short day (10L:14D) during the period from November to July. Moreover, in the peak of sexual activity (March), an additional group was on exposure (6 weeks) to long day (LD; 16L:8D). During the first half of reproduction (January, March; photosensitive period), GnRH-I (1.9 vs. 0.3 relative quantity [RQ]) and LHβ (3.0 vs. 0.7 RQ) mRNA transcript expression and concentrations of T (1.9-2.9 vs. 0.3 ng/mL), LH (13.6-7.4 vs. 0.7 ng/mL) were found to be higher (P < 0.05) than at the end of breeding (July). With progress in breeding, marked elevation (P < 0.05) in PRL (22.0-387.1 ng/mL) concentration related to similar changes in vasoactive intestinal peptide (0.9-3.0 RQ) and PRL mRNA abundance (1.3-11.5 RQ; May, July) was observed. However, testis PRLR mRNA increased (P < 0.05) only at the end of reproduction (1.2 RQ) compared to the peak of sexual activity (0.4 RQ; March). Furthermore, changes in mRNA transcript expression of the lactotrophic axis were accompanied with reduction of testis weight (left: 11.1-5.8 g), spermatogenesis (spermatogenic index: 5.4-3.0), and steroidogenesis (T: 24.8-1.3 ng/g testis), which may suggest their pivotal inhibitory modulation role in the regression of seasonal reproductive activity in ganders. The LD conditions (similar to spring-summer) resulted in earlier peripheral changes in T (0.9 vs. 1.8 ng/mL), LH (1.1 vs. 3.8 ng/mL), and PRL (296.1 vs. 161.2 ng/mL) concentrations than in short day, and this may be related to the advance in the timing of the sexual activity failure observed under natural light regimes. The lack of differences in gonadal and lactotrophic axis mRNA expression after LD treatment suggested a regulation based on the posttranslational mechanisms or modification of transcript or protein.

Production of ducks and geese in certain parts of the world is very important. Mycoplasma diseases cause significant losses to the duck and goose industry. This review summarizes the epidemiological, clinical, and pathomorphological characteristics of mycoplasma diseases of ducks and geese and the involvement of the various mycoplasma species in their pathogenesis. The role of mycoplasma infections in the development of clinical signs, pathological lesions, and mortality of challenged birds is demonstrated in challenge experiments. Transmission of mycoplasma in the ovary and eggs resulting in the reduction of egg production and an increase of embryo mortality has been shown in challenge experiments as well as in field studies. The susceptibility of many mycoplasma isolates of the most important mycoplasma species of duck and goose origin were tested and showed relatively high average minimum inhibitory concentrations of lincomycin, tilosin, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, and enrofloxacin but not for tiamulin. The successful treatment of mycoplasma infections with antibiotics in ducks and geese should be selected based on the minimum inhibitory concentration values against the mycoplasmas isolated from the flock.

Experimental data on the relationship between mean heart rate (f(H)) and mean rate of oxygen consumption (VO(2)) of captive barnacle geese during flights in a wind tunnel are assessed in terms of their capacity to predict the typical VO(2) of wild barnacle geese, based on the recordings of their f(H), while undertaking autumn migratory flights between Spitsbergen (78 degrees N) and Caerlaverock, Scotland (55 degrees N). A significant linear relationship has been demonstrated between the f(H) and simultaneously recorded VO(2) of a single barnacle goose (B-B) flying in the wind tunnel (VO(2)=1.42 f(H)-304, r(2)=0.82, P<0.001, N=12 flights). Data recorded from three additional geese (N=4 flights), lay within the 95% prediction intervals of the relationship for goose B-B. When these geese (mean body mass=2.06 kg, n=4) were flown in the wind tunnel (WT) without the mask, they had a mean f(H) of 451+/-23 beats min(-1), yielding an estimate for VO(2) of 336+/-33 ml min(-1). However, f(H) has also been recorded from wild barnacle geese (mean migratory f(H) of 253 beats min(-1)), and substitution of this value into the above calibration equation results in an unrealistically low value for mean migratory VO(2) of only 55 ml min(-1). Various factors, such as differences in heart mass, selective tissue perfusion, environmental temperature and flock formation, which might account for some of the difference in f(H) between the captive and wild geese are discussed. Comparison with other WT studies shows that inter-species minimum mass-specific VO(2) declines with increasing body mass (M(b); range 0.035-2.8 kg) as 173 M(b)(-0.224), r(2)=0.848.

Respiration of birds at high altitude and the structural adaptation of avian hemoglobins are studied. Applying the method of the "minimal biological distance", hemoglobins of closely related species were sequenced and compared with each other. Physiological measurements and sequence data show that adaptation to hypoxic stress can be interpreted as exchange of one amino acid. The structural aspects of the genetical data are discussed on the basis of the atomic model of hemoglobin. High-altitude respiration is not a general characteristic of birds: the adaptation to high altitudes is the result of a specific mutation, thus distinguishing a species from its closest relatives in the lowland.

To provide data for studies on avian disease resistance, goose MHC class I cDNA (Ancy-MHC I) was cloned from a goose cDNA library, it's genomic structure and expression analysis were investigated. The mature peptides of Ancy-MHC I cDNA encoded 333 amino acids. The genomic organization is composed of eight exons and seven introns. Based on the genetic distance, six Ancy-MHC I genes from six individuals can be classified into four lineages. A total of nineteen amino acid positions in peptide-binding domain showed high scores by Wu-kabat index analysis. The Ancy-MHC I amino acid sequence displayed seven critical HLA-A2 amino acids that bind with antigen polypeptides, and have an 85.4-98.9% amino acid homology with each genes, and a 59.8-66.0% amino acid homology with chicken MHC class I. Expression analyses using Q-RT-PCR to detect the tissue-specific expression of Ancy-MHC I mRNA in an adult goose. The result appeared that Ancy-MHC I cDNA was expressed in the liver, spleen, intestine, kidney, lung, pancreas, heart, brain, and skin. The phylogenetic tree appears to branch in an order consistent with accepted evolutionary pathways.

Unlike mammals, in palmipedes de novo lipogenesis from diet takes place mostly in the liver. The French Landes Goose is famous for its high capacity and susceptibility to fatty liver production. While miRNAs play a critical role in the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression, miRNAs that are involved in the regulation of goose hepatic steatosis have yet to be elucidated. Using high-throughput sequencing, we analyzed miRNAs expression profile of Landes goose liver after overfeeding for 21 days. Aan-miR-122-5p was the most frequently sequenced known miRNA, but it was unchanged after overfeeding. Compared with normal liver, we identified that 16 conserved miRNAs were up-regulated while the other 9 conserved miRNAs were down-regulated in fatty livers. Many of their predicted target genes played key roles in metabolic pathways leading to the development of hepatic steatosis in the goose by KEGG pathways analysis. ACSL1 and ELOVL6 were critical genes in hepatic lipid metabolism and had opposite expression patterns with aan-miR-203a and aan-miR-125b-5p, respectively. And we validated that aan-miR-203a and aan-miR-125b-5p might involve in the regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism by targeting ACSL1 and ELOVL6, respectively. These results add to our current understanding of the regulation network in goose lipid metabolism.

To investigate mechanisms that may allow birds to tolerate extreme high altitude, we acutely exposed unanesthetized bar-headed geese (Anser indicus) and Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) to 0.21, 0.10, and 0.05 inspired fractional concentrations of O2 (FIO2). In both birds, arterial O2 partial pressure (PaO2) was about 95 Torr at 0.21 FIO2, 45 Torr at 0.10 FIO2, and 28 Torr at 0.05 FIO2. Hyperventilation occurred at both levels of hypoxia, with PaCO2 decreasing to about 7 Torr at 28 Torr PaO2. At 28 Torr PaO2, arterial O2 content (CaO2) in geese (10.4 vol%) was significantly higher than in ducks (4.1 vol%). As PaO2 declined from about 95 to 28 Torr, both cerebral and coronary blood flow (determined by using the radioactive microsphere method) increased more than fivefold in ducks but less than threefold in geese. At both levels of hypoxia, O2 delivery (flow X CaO2) to the heart and brain of geese was the same as or higher than that of ducks. The unique control of cerebral and coronary O2 delivery exhibited by both species of birds may be related to their remarkable tolerance to severe hypocapnic hypoxia.

Studies on mammals demonstrate wide interspecific variation in the number and distribution of recombination events along chromosomes. Birds represent an interesting model group for comparative analysis of cytological and ecological drivers of recombination rate evolution. Yet, data on variation in recombination rates in birds are limited to a dozen of species. In this study, we used immunolocalization of MLH1, a mismatch repair protein marking mature recombination nodules, to estimate the overall recombination rate and distribution of crossovers along macrochromosomes in female and male meiosis of the gray goose (Anser anser). The average number of MLH1 foci was significantly higher in oocytes than in spermatocytes (73.6 ± 7.8 and 58.9 ± 7.6, respectively). MLH1 foci distribution along individual macrobivalents showed subtelomeric peaks, which were more pronounced in males. Analysis of distances between neighboring MLH1 foci on macrobivalents revealed stronger crossover interference in male meiosis. These data create a framework for future genetic and physical mapping of the gray goose.

The Canada goose (Branta canadensis) entire mitochondrial genome of a bird from Western Pennsylvania has 16,760 bp (GenBank accession number NC 007011) and has been analyzed for gene locations, length, start codon and stop codons. This genome from a bird harvested during the non-migratory season is the REFSEQ and the haplotype is designated GCC-A. There are two rRNAs, 22 tRNAs, 13 protein-coding regions, and 1 displacement loop region. The base composition of mtDNA was A (30.2%), G (15.1%), C (32.1%), and T (22.6%), so the percentage of A and T (52.8%) was slightly higher than G and C. All genes except ND6 and eight tRNA genes (Gln, Ala, Asn, Cys, Tyr, Ser, Pro and Glu) are encoded on the heavy strand. The gene arrangement is the same as most birds and differs from mammals by an inversion of the mtDNA at the connection between the D-loop and the ND5 junctions.

The primary structures of the alpha- and beta-chains of the main component of Bar-headed Goose (Anser indicus) are given. By homologous comparison with the hemoglobin of the Grey-Lag Goose (Anser anser) 3 differences were found in the alpha-chains, 1 difference in the beta-chains. In position alpha 119 H2Ala and beta 125 H3Asp alpha 1 beta 2-contact points are changed. The mutation alpha 63 E12Val brings a drastic change in tertiary structure of the alpha-chains of Bar-headed Goose: the helices E and B are moved apart by 1.5 A as there is no room for the larger side chain. This is probably the reason for a slightly higher intrinsic oxygen affinity of Bar-headed Goose hemoglobin. The bindings of inositol pentaphosphate on hemoglobin are identical in Grey-Lag Goose and Bar-headed Goose (contact points are not mutated). The reason for the increased difference in oxygen affinity by binding of inositol pentaphosphate is probably caused by two mutations in alpha 1 beta 2-contact points. It suggests that these two mutations are the reason for a different interaction between alpha- and beta-chains under the influence of inositol pentaphosphate by Grey-Lag and Bar-headed Goose hemoglobins. The difference in the primary structure of the Grey-Lag and Bar-headed Goose hemoglobins suggests that the Bar-headed Goose is not the genus of anser. Unfinished experiments (about 80% of the sequences) of White-fronted Goose (Anser albifrons a.) and Snow Goose (Anser caerulescens c.) show no exchanges with Grey-Lag Goose hemoglobin. The Canada Goose (Branta canadensis), however, which belongs to the genus Branta, has a number of substitutions similar to the Bar-headed Goose hemoglobin. These changes in primary structure suggest that Grey-Lag Goose and Bar-headed Goose are separated by a period of 9-15 Million years. This would support the hypothesis that the two species of goose became geographically separated by the elevation of the Himalayas.

Many high-altitude vertebrates have evolved increased capacities in their oxygen transport cascade (ventilation, pulmonary diffusion, circulation and tissue diffusion), enhancing oxygen transfer from the atmosphere to mitochondria. However, the extent of interspecies variation in the control processes that dictate hypoxia responses remains largely unknown. We compared the metabolic, cardiovascular and respiratory responses to progressive decreases in inspired oxygen levels of bar-headed geese (Anser indicus), birds that biannually migrate across the Himalayan mountains, with those of Andean geese (Chloephaga melanoptera) and crested ducks (Lophonetta specularioides), lifelong residents of the high Andes. We show that Andean geese and crested ducks have evolved fundamentally different mechanisms for maintaining oxygen supply during low oxygen (hypoxia) from those of bar-headed geese. Bar-headed geese respond to hypoxia with robust increases in ventilation and heart rate, whereas Andean species increase lung oxygen extraction and cardiac stroke volume. We propose that transient high-altitude performance has favoured the evolution of robust convective oxygen transport recruitment in hypoxia, whereas life-long high-altitude residency has favoured the evolution of structural enhancements to the lungs and heart that increase lung diffusion and stroke volume.

1. This study investigated the effect of incubation type and production system on geese growth traits. 2. A total of 216 geese were either naturally (114) or artificially (102) hatched and reared in intensive or free-range production systems (4 replicates each) until 18 weeks of age. 3. Weights of naturally hatched goslings (NHG) were significantly higher than artificially hatched goslings (AHG) at 2 weeks (644 vs. 536 g); however, weights of AHG were significantly higher than NHG at both 6 weeks (3245 vs. 3010 g) and 18 weeks (5212 vs. 4353 g). 4. AHG had better feed conversion ratios (FCRs) than NHG (6.21 vs. 6.46 at 18 weeks). Feed consumption of naturally hatched geese was found higher in first 4 weeks when compared to artificially hatched geese and artificially hatched geese consumed more feed than naturally hatched geese after 8 weeks. 5. Production system had insignificant effects on feed consumption, FCRs, viability and mutilation rates. 6. Slipped wings were more frequent in NHG than AHG (8.32% vs. 1.68% at 6 weeks; 23.84% vs. 5.12% between 7 and 18 weeks) and in free-range production when compared to intensive production (17.88% vs. 11.08% over the course of the production period). 7. The study results indicate that both artificially and NHG can be reared in free-range production systems without any loss in performance and in deference to animal welfare.

The development of the cecum and colon in the goose was investigated during the period from the 15th to 28th day of the incubation and from 1 to 30 days of age after hatching by light microscopy. By day 15 of the incubation, in the cecum and colon, the lumen was surrounded by pseudostratified epithelium. The previllous ridges appeared at 15th and 17th days of the incubation in the colon and ceca, respectively. At the base of previllous ridges, the epithelium changed into a simple prismathic epithelium at 15th and 17th days of the incubation in the colon and cecum, respectively. The villi appeared at the 21st days of the incubation. The crypts and goblet cells appeared on the first day after hatching. In the pre-hatching period, the lamina muscularis mucosa was present only in the colon. The submucosa consisted of loosely aggregated connective tissue in the pre-hatching period. In the post-hatching period, it consisted of a very thin layer of connective tissue. Its presence was only obvious where the cells of the submucosal nerve plexus or occasional large blood vessels considerably increased its thickness. The nerve plexus corresponding to the Auerbach's plexus of the mammalian intestine and submucosal nerve plexus appeared by 15th days of the incubation. From the 15th to 28th day of incubation, the tunica muscularis consisted of circular smooth muscle cells in the ceca. On the 28th day of the incubation a thinner longitudinal muscle layer added to the circular muscle layer. In the colon there was an outer longitudinal and a thicker circular muscle layer.

Hypertrophy of the flight muscles is regularly observed in birds prior to long-distance migrations. We tested the hypothesis that a large migratory bird would increase flight behaviour prior to migration, in order to cause hypertrophy of the flight muscles, and upregulate key components of the aerobic metabolic pathways. Implantable data loggers were used to record year-round heart rate in six wild barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis), and the amount of time spent in flight each day was identified. Time in flight per day did not significantly increase prior to either the spring or the autumn migration, both between time periods prior to migration (5, 10 and 15 days), or when compared with a control period of low activity during winter. The lack of significant increase in flight prior to migration suggests that approximately 22 min per day is sufficient to maintain the flight muscles in condition for prolonged long-distance flight. This apparent lack of a requirement for increased flight activity prior to migration may be attributable to pre-migratory mass gains in the geese increasing workload during short flights, potentially prompting hypertrophy of the flight muscles.

Animals foraging in groups can either search for food themselves (producing) or search for the food discoveries of other individuals (scrounging). Tactic use in producer-scrounger games is partly flexible but individuals tend to show consistency in tactic use under different conditions suggesting that personality might play a role in tactic use in producer-scrounger games. Here we studied the use of producing and scrounging tactics by bold and shy barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis), where boldness is a personality trait known to be repeatable over time in this species. We defined individuals as bold, shy or intermediate based on two novel object tests. We scored the frequency of finding food patches (the outcome of investing in producing) and joining patches (the outcome of investing in scrounging) by bold and shy individuals and their feeding time. Shy individuals had a higher frequency of joining than bold individuals, demonstrating for the first time that personality is associated with tactic use in a producer-scrounger game. Bold individuals tended to spend more time feeding than shy individuals. Our results highlight the importance of including individual behavioural variation in models of producer-scrounger games.

Adult male Branta canadensis maxima were collected from a nonmigratory feral population during their premolt, molt and postmolt phases. Lean dry weight of the pectoralis muscle decreased significantly (p less than or equal to 0.0001) during molt, as a result of disuse atrophy. Histochemical analysis revealed that the region of the pectoralis muscle sampled consisted of Red (fast-twitch oxidative-glycolytic) and White (fast-twitch glycolytic) muscle fiber types, in an approximate ratio of 9 to 1. There was no significant (p = 0.1238) difference in the relative percentages of the two fiber types during the three periods of study. There was, however, a significant decrease in mean cross-sectional area of both Red (p less than or equal to 0.0194) and White (p less than or equal to 0.0001) fibers during molt. Red and White fiber areas were strongly correlated with each other during molt (r2 = 0.76, p = 0.0010) and postmolt (r2 = 0.70, p = 0.0052), but not during premolt (r2 = 0.02, p = 0.7626). The latter finding may be related to fiber-type specific hypertrophy in premolt breeding males. Analysis of ultrastructure revealed that there was a significant (p = 0.0003) decrease in the mean myofibrillar cross-sectional area, and a significant increase in both the density (p = 0.0227) and total number (p = 0.0058) of myofibrils within the muscle fibers of the molting birds. These results indicate that the myofibrils split longitudinally during molt-associated disuse atrophy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).

A key question in evolutionary genetics is whether shared genetic mechanisms underlie the independent evolution of similar phenotypes across phylogenetically divergent lineages. Here we show that in two classic examples of melanic plumage polymorphisms in birds, lesser snow geese (Anser c. caerulescens) and arctic skuas (Stercorarius parasiticus), melanism is perfectly associated with variation in the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene. In both species, the degree of melanism correlates with the number of copies of variant MC1R alleles. Phylogenetic reconstructions of variant MC1R alleles in geese and skuas show that melanism is a derived trait that evolved in the Pleistocene.

The karyotype of the domestic goose A. cygnoides was characterised on the basis of R and C bands. Chromosomal preparations obtained from an in vitro culture of blood lymphocytes were stained by means of the RBG and CBG banding techniques. The first nine pairs of chromosomes were analysed by the R banding technique, while fourteen pairs of chromosomes were analysed by the C banding technique. The localisation of R bands as well as the sizes and positions of constitutive heterochromatin blocks were determined. Ideograms of R and C banded patterns for the analysed chromosomes were drawn. The morphological make-up of the analysed chromosomes was assessed.

280 specimens of 29 species of wild living birds from 11 families captured in the endemic area of the virus Lednice in Southern Moravia (CSSR) were investigated by haemagglutination-inhibition test (HIT) on presence of antibodies against 12 arbovirus antigens of the groups Alfa-virus (Western and Eastern Equine Encephalomyelitis, Semliki, Sindbis, Chikungunya), Flavovirus (Tick-Borne Encephalitis, Dengue, West Nile), the Uukuniemi group (Poteplí), the Turlock group (Lednice) and the Bunyamwera supergroup (Tahyna, Calovo). Antibodies were found only against the virus Lednice, merely in water birds--i.e. in Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos)--31.9%, in Grey Lag-Goose (Anser anser)--17.2%, and in one of three Mute Swans (Cygnus olor). In relation to these findings the question of ornithophilia of mosquitoes of Culex modestus species, which are the only probable vectors of Lednice virus as yet, is discussed.

The hypothalamus plays a central role in controlling poultry reproductive activity. To increase our understanding of genes involved in egg laying of Huoyan geese, gene profiles in the hypothalamus of laying period and ceased period Huoyan geese were investigated using suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) method. A total of 95 differentially expressed sequence tags (ESTs), including 46 up-regulated and 49 down-regulated sequences showed homology to known genes of the non-redundant NCBI databases. Bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that these genes were mainly involved in anatomical structure development, signal transduction, cellular nitrogen compound metabolic process, biosynthetic process, cellular protein modification process, cell differentiation, transport, cell adhesion, and reproduction. Ten ESTs were selected for further analyses by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Whose most part of results were consistent with the SSH results. Of note, AdipoR2, Nrg1, and NCAM1, which related with secretion of GnRH and other hormones, were identified to be differentially expressed between laying period and ceased period. These findings provided a new source for mining genes related to higher laying performance of Huoyan geese, which facilitate our understanding of the reproductive biology of the goose.

Interleukin-17 (IL-17 or IL-17A) is a proinflammatory cytokine produced by activated T cells. IL-17A plays important roles in inflammation and host defense. In this study, the cDNA of the goose IL-17A (GoIL-17A) gene was cloned from thymocytes. Recombinant GoIL-17A (rGoIL-17A) was expressed using a baculovirus expression system and then biologically characterized. The complete open reading frame (ORF) of GoIL-17A contains 510 base pairs that encode 169 amino acid residues, including a 29-amino acid signal peptide and a single potential N-linked glycosylation site. This protein has a molecular weight of 18.9kDa. The amino acid sequence showed 95.9%, 84.6%, 45.0% and 38.4% similarity with the corresponding duck, chicken, rat, and human IL-17A sequences, respectively. The six conserved cysteine residues were also observed in GoIL-17A. A recombinant, mature form of GoIL-17A was produced and its biological activities in goose embryonic fibroblasts were investigated. RT-PCR analysis revealed a marked up-regulation of IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA expression in goose embryonic fibroblasts treated with 1-50 μg of rGoIL-17A for 12h. The GoIL-17A gene sequence and the biologically active recombinant protein may be useful for understanding the role of IL-17A in immune regulation.

This paper demonstrates automatic recognition of vocalizations of four common bird species (herring gull [Larus argentatus], blue jay [Cyanocitta cristata], Canada goose [Branta canadensis], and American crow [Corvus brachyrhynchos]) using an algorithm that extracts frequency track sets using track properties of importance and harmonic correlation. The main result is that a complex harmonic vocalization is rendered into a set of related tracks that is easily applied to statistical models of the actual bird vocalizations. For each vocalization type, a statistical model of the vocalization was created by transforming the training set frequency tracks into feature vectors. The extraction algorithm extracts sets of frequency tracks from test recordings that closely approximate harmonic sounds in the file being processed. Each extracted set in its final form is then compared with the statistical models generated during the training phase using Mahalanobis distance functions. If it matches one of the models closely, the recognizer declares the set an occurrence of the corresponding vocalization. The method was evaluated against a test set containing vocalizations of both the 4 target species and 16 additional species as well as background noise containing planes, cars, and various natural sounds.

1. The effects of different fibre sources on the growth performance, carcass characteristics and gastrointestinal tract development were studied in growing Greylag geese (Anser anser). 2. Four experimental diets were formulated with corn (maize) straw silage (CSS), steam-exploded corn (maize) straw, steam-exploded wheat straw, and steam-exploded rice straw as fibre sources. A total of 224 male Greylag geese at 28 d of age were randomly assigned to one of the 4 experimental diets. 3. The birds fed on the CSS diets had higher average daily feed intakes than those fed on the steam-exploded straws. However, the 4 treatments had similar average daily gain, which contributed to significant differences in feed conversion ratios. The different fibre sources had no significant effects on the carcass characteristics. 4. The CSS-fed birds had larger gizzards and lower relative length of the caeca than the other three groups. However, the relative weights and lengths of the other gut segments, the relative weights of major organs and the pH values of the gastrointestinal contents were similar between the 4 treatments. It was concluded that straw fibres with different physico-chemical properties exerted an effect on daily feed intake and gastrointestinal development, especially for the gizzard. The pretreatment of straw had a large effect on utilisation efficiency and animal performance. Steam explosion is a promising straw pretreatment for inclusion in diets for geese.

Broodiness is the primary factor influencing egg production in geese, in which several genes and miRNAs participate. Detailed spatiotemporal profiles of miRNAs encompassing follicle development levels, however, are lacking. In this study, we collected preovulatory follicles (classified as small white follicles, large white follicles, and small yellow follicles) from brooding and laying geese and aimed to analyze microRNA (miRNA or miR) during folliculogenesis. High-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis were used to identify the miRNAs involved in follicle development. The let7 family, miR-10 family, and miR-143 family were abundant in these libraries, and they have been suggested to play a housekeeping role during folliculogenesis. Joint comparisons revealed 23 upregulated and 21 downregulated miRNAs (in at least two comparisons of follicles during brooding and laying, P < 0.1) in the laying stage. Unlike reproduction pathways reported for ovaries, GO and KEGG analysis suggested pathways for cell apoptosis and proliferation, such as the regulation of actin cytoskeleton, endocytosis, axon guidance, pathways in cancer, tight junctions, focal adhesion, the MAPK signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, and the Wnt signaling pathway in folliculogenesis. This study revealed the miRNAs that were directly involved in follicular atresia, and our results added to the understanding of the functional involvement of miRNAs during specific stages of follicle development.

A control group of geese (Anser anser) on a normal calcium diet for egg laying poultry was compared to egg laying geese on a calcium deficient diet. The ultimate compressive strength and modulus of elasticity of femoral cortical bone from each group were determined by compressing right circular cylinders which were 2.4 mm in height and 0.8 mm in diameter. The bending strength and bending modulus of elasticity of tibial cortical bone were determined by three point bend tests on rectangular prisms which were approximately 25 mm by 0.8 mm by 0.8 mm. Bone calcium content and eggshell calcium content were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Blood samples were analyzed for free calcium ion concentration. Histological observations included studies of cross-sectional microradiographs, examinations of cross sections stained by a modified Masson's technique, and a determination of fractional area of voids by quantitative microscopy. The average compressive modulus for the control birds was 12.0 GPa (S.D.: 6.2 GPa) while the ultimate compressive strength was 165 MPa (S.D.: 27 MPa). Calcium deprived birds showed slight, but not statistically significant, decreases in both the compressive modulus and compressive strength. The tibial three point bending modulus for the control birds was 16.5 GPa (S.D.: 2.6 GPa) while the ultimate bending strength was 256 MPa (S.D.: 58 MPa). Once again, slight though not statistically significant decreases in the bending modulus and strength were seen in the geese on the calcium deficient diet. The average calcium content (wt%) of the femora of the control birds was 20.5% (S.D.: 4.3%) and 20.6% (S.D.: 4.8%) for the tibiae. No significant differences were noted in the calcium deprived birds. The average fractional void area for the control bird femoral bone was 12.0% (S.D.: 2.6%) and 9.8% (S.D.: 1.8%) for the tibial bone. Significantly greater fractional void areas were noted in the calcium deficient birds as were profound changes in the macrocellular structure of these bones.

This study comprises two trials that investigated the effects of feeding time and time-restricted feeding on the fattening traits and plasma metabolite levels of White Roman geese. In Trial I, 24 geese aged 8 weeks of each sex were allowed free access to a fattening diet for 1 h either in the morning (morning-feeding group) or afternoon (afternoon-feeding group). At 12 weeks of age, blood samples were collected hourly for 4 h, beginning 1 h after feeding to determine the plasma levels of glucose, triacylglycerols and uric acid. The results showed a lower (P<0.05) daily feed intake (DFI) and daily gain (DG) and higher (P<0.05) feed efficiency (FE) for the morning-feeding group compared with those of the afternoon-feeding group. In addition, the postprandial plasma levels of glucose, triacylglycerols and uric acid did not differ (P>0.05) between groups. In Trial II, 12 geese aged 8 weeks of each sex were randomly assigned to either the ad libitum feeding group (control group) or time-restricted feeding group (restricted group). The geese in the control group were fed a fattening diet ad libitum, whereas those in the restricted group were allowed access to the diet for 2 h every morning. All geese were killed at 13 weeks of age and their carcass traits were evaluated. The results showed a lower DFI and DG and higher FE for the restricted group compared with those of the control group (P<0.05). In addition, the restricted group exhibited lower visceral and abdominal fat and higher empty digestive tract and liver weights than those of the control group (P<0.05). The results showed that time-restricted feeding in the morning resulted in superior DG and FE compared with feeding in the afternoon. Moreover, time-restricted feeding implemented in the morning during the fattening period reduced DFI and increased FE in geese compared with ad libitum feeding.

Understanding the functional response of species is important in comprehending the species' population dynamics and the functioning of multi-species assemblages. A Type II functional response, where instantaneous intake rate increases asymptotically with sward biomass, is thought to be common in grazers. However, at tall, dense swards, food intake might decline due to mechanical limitations or if animals selectively forage on the most nutritious parts of a sward, leading to a Type IV functional response, especially for smaller herbivores. We tested the predictions that bite mass, cropping time, swallowing time and searching time increase, and bite rate decreases with increasing grass biomass for different-sized Canada geese (Branta canadensis) foraging on grass swards. Bite mass indeed showed an increasing asymptotic relationship with grass biomass. At high biomass, difficulties in handling long leaves and in locating bites were responsible for increasing cropping, swallowing, and searching times. Constant bite mass and decreasing bite rate caused the intake rate to decrease at high sward biomass after reaching an optimum, leading to a Type IV functional response. Grazer body mass affected maximum bite mass and intake rate, but did not change the shape of the functional response. As grass nutrient contents are usually highest in short swards, this Type IV functional response in geese leads to an intake rate that is maximised in these swards. The lower grass biomass at which intake rate was maximised allows resource partitioning between different-sized grazers. We argue that this Type IV functional response is of more importance than previously thought.

The objective of this investigation was to clone goose FSHβ-subunit cDNA and to construct a FSH fusion gene to identify the function of FSHβ mRNA during stages of the breeding cycle. The FSHβ gene was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR, and the full-length FSHβ mRNA sequence was amplified by rapid-amplification of cDNA ends. FSHβ mRNA expression was detected in reproductive tissues at different stages (pre-laying, laying period, and broody period). Additionally, the expression of 4 genes known to be involved in reproduction (FSHβ, GnRH, GH, and BMP) were evaluated in COS-7 cells expressing the fusion gene (pVITRO2-FSHαβ-CTP). The results show that the FSHβ gene consists of a 16 base pair (bp) 5'-untranslated region (UTR), 396 bp open reading frame, and alternative 3'-UTRs at 518 bp and 780 bp, respectively. qPCR analyses revealed that FSHβ mRNA is highly transcribed in reproductive tissues, including the pituitary, hypothalamus, ovaries, and oviduct. FSHβ mRNA expression increased and subsequently decreased in the pituitary, ovaries, and oviduct during the reproductive stages. Stable FSH expression was confirmed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays after transfection with the pVITRO2-FSHαβ-CTP plasmid. FSHβ, GnRH, and BMP expression increased significantly 36 h and 48 h after transfection with the fusion gene in COS-7 cells. The results demonstrate that the FSHβ subunit functions in the goose reproductive cycle and provides a theoretical basis for future breeding work.

Experiments were carried out with regard to certain changes in the liver of geese during their fattening period. The observations were made before the fattening of the geese, namely on the 5th , 10th, 15th, 20th, 25th and 33rd days of the fattening. It was established that during the fattening period the weight of the liver was constantly increasing, especially between the 20th and 25th days. During the fattening their water contents decreased. This tendency was most pronounced after the period of pecking was over. As the process of fattening advanced, the dry substance in the liver increased and the highest increase (by 10.21%) was observed during the interval between the 15th and 20th days. The percentage of the total lipids in the liver increased progressively up to 18.9 times. In the case of unfattened geese the satiated free butyric acids prevailed. In the process of fattening their quantity decreased, whereas that of the unsatiated butyric acids increased.

Microgamonts and macrogamonts of Eimeria truncata were observed in renal epithelial cells of collecting tubules and ducts and occasionally in macrophages of experimentally infected lesser snow geese (Anser c. caerulescens) beginning 8.5 days post inoculation. Intraparasitophorous vesicles in parasitophorous vacuoles of both types of gamonts appeared to originate in host cell cytoplasm and enter gamonts through micropores by budding of plasmalemma or by pinocytosis. Within the parasite's cytoplasm, the vesicles were broken down in Golgi-associated vacuoles. The surfaces of microgamonts were highly invaginated to facilitate extrusion of numerous microgametes. Formation and maturation of microgametes were similar to those of other eimerian species. Each microgamete had two flagella, a mitochondrion, and a peculiarly shaped electron-dense nucleus that was oval anteriorly in cross section and somewhat dumbbell-shaped posteriorly. A longitudinally arranged inner membrane complex lay between a portion of the mitochondrion and the plasmalemma. About five subpellicular microtubules extended the length of the microgamete body. Macrogametogony differed little from that described in other eimerian species. Type 1 wall-forming bodies (WFB) formed in Golgi complexes early in macrogametogony, and type 2 WFB formed in cisternae of endoplasmic reticulum in intermediate stages of macrogamont development.

Cloacal swabs from adult breeding geese of both sexes from six separate farms were culturally examined for mycoplasmas. Geese from these flocks did not show any clinical signs of illness, increased mortality or drop in egg production during the reproductive season. The results revealed the presence of mycoplasmas in all the flocks tested. Mycoplasma (M.) cloacale was found in 6 flocks, M. anseris in 4 flocks, Mycoplasma species 1220 in 3 flocks and non-identifiable Mycoplasmas in 2 flocks. More than one Mycoplasma species was simultaneously isolated from 14 out of 37 geese.

This study examined the reproductive endocrine profile under natural and artificial photoperiods in Magang goose ganders. Group 1 ganders (n=8) served as non-treated controls and were exposed to natural photoperiod throughout the experiment from 13th January to 17th December 2004. Group 2 ganders (n=8) were exposed to 18 h long daily photoperiod for 60 days from 13 January till 15 March 2004 and again to 16 h photoperiod for 75 days till 10th October 2004, and the 11h short photoperiod in the remainder periods of the experiment. In control ganders, plasma LH concentrations were high in normal breeding seasons (August-March) and decreased to low levels in non-breeding season from April to July. Testosterone concentrations changed similarly to that of LH throughout the seasons. Seasonal pattern of PRL concentrations was opposite to those of LH and testosterone, with low values in breeding season and high values in non-breeding season. In artificial photoperiod treated ganders, increasing photoperiod increased PRL and decreased LH and testosterone concentrations, while decreasing photoperiod reversed these changes. There were no seasonal or photoperiod caused changes in plasma T3 concentrations in both control ganders and artificial photoperiod treated ganders. These results demonstrated that in Magang goose ganders that long photoperiod stimulates PRL secretion and decreases LH secretion, which terminates reproductive season in spring and early summer, and short photoperiod stimulates LH secretion and inhibits PRL secretion rendering ganders enter into reproductive season.

The nucleotide sequences of nucleocapsid protein (N); phosphoprotein (P); matrix protein (M); hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN); and large polymerase protein (L) genes, 3'-end leader, 5'-end trailer and intergenic regions of the avian paramyxovirus (APMV) strain goose/Shimane/67/2000 (APMV/Shimane67) were determined. Together with previously reported data on fusion protein (F) gene sequence [46], the determination of the genome sequence of APMV/Shimane67 has been completed in this study. The genome of APMV/Shimane67 comprised 16,146 nucleotides in length and contains six genes in the order of 3'-N-P-M-F-HN-L-5'. The features of the APMV/Shimane67 genome (e.g., nucleotide length of whole genome and each of the six genes, and predicted amino acid length of each of the six genes) were distinct from those of other APMV serotypes. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that although APMV/Shimane67 was grouped with APMV-1, -9 and -12, the evolutionary distance between APMV/Shimane67 and these viruses was longer than that observed between intra-serotype viruses. These results show that the genome sequence of APMV/Shimane67 contains specific characteristics and is distinguishable from other types of APMV.

Carex meadows are critical habitat for wintering geese in the floodplains of the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River, China. These meadows follow a growth cycle closely tied to the seasonal hydrological fluctuation: as water levels recede in the fall, exposed mudflats provide habitat for Carex spp. growth. The seasonal growth of Carex overlaps the arrival of wintering geese and provides an important food source for the migrants. Recent alterations to the Yangtze's hydrology, however, have disrupted the synchronous relationship between water levels, Carex growth and wintering geese at Dongting Lake. In October 2012, we carried out an outdoor mesocosm experiment to investigate potential impacts of delayed water recession on the germination and growth of Carex heterolepis, the dominant Carex species at Dongting Lake, to understand how changes in hydrology might impact wintering goose habitat. Results showed that the delayed flood recession exerted significant impact on the first growth cycle of Carex growth. Prolonged inundation significantly lowered the intrinsic growth rate (P = 0.03) and maximum growth rates (P = 0.02). It also took significantly longer time to reach the peak growth rate (P = 0.04 and 0.05 for number of shoot and biomass, respectively). As a result, biomass accumulation was reduced by 45, 62 and 90 % for 10-day, 20-day and 30-day inundation treatments, respectively. These results indicate a severe risk of food shortage for wintering geese when water recession delayed. This potential risk should be taken into consideration when operating any hydrological control structures that alter the flood regimes in Dongting Lake.

The retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) protein play a critical role in the interferon (IFN) response during RNA virus infection. The tripartite motif containing 25 proteins (TRIM25) was reported to modify caspase activation and RIG-I recruitment domains (CARDs) via ubiquitin. These modifications allow TRIM25 to interact with mitochondrial antiviral signaling molecules (MAVs) and form CARD-CARD tetramers. Goose TRIM25 was cloned from gosling lungs, which possess a 1662 bp open reading flame (ORF). This ORF encodes a predicted 554 amino acid protein consisting of a B-box domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a PRY/SPRY domain. The protein sequence has 89.25% sequence identity with Anas platyrhynchos TRIM25, 78.57% with Gallus gallus TRIM25, and 46.92% with Homo sapiens TRIM25. TRIM25 is expressed in all gosling and adult goose tissues examined. QRT-PCR revealed that goose TRIM25 transcription could be induced by goose IFN-α, goose IFN-γ, and goose IFN-λ, as well as a35 s polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), oligodeoxynucleotides 2006 (ODN 2006), and resiquimod (R848) in vitro; however, it is inhibited in H9N2 infected goslings for unknown reasons. These data suggest that goose TRIM25 might play a positive role in the regulation of the antiviral immune response.

Matrix population models that allow an animal to occupy more than one state over time are important tools for population and evolutionary ecologists. Definition of state can vary, including location for metapopulation models and breeding state for life history models. For populations whose members can be marked and subsequently reencountered, multistate mark-recapture models are available to estimate the survival and transition probabilities needed to construct population models. Multistate models have proved extremely useful in this context, but they often require a substantial amount of data and restrict estimation of transition probabilities to those areas or states subjected to formal sampling effort. At the same time, for many species, there are considerable tag recovery data provided by the public that could be modeled in order to increase precision and to extend inference to a greater number of areas or states. Here we present a statistical model for combining multistate capture-recapture data (e.g., from a breeding ground study) with multistate tag recovery data (e.g., from wintering grounds). We use this method to analyze data from a study of Canada Geese (Branta canadensis) in the Atlantic Flyway of North America. Our analysis produced marginal improvement in precision, due to relatively few recoveries, but we demonstrate how precision could be further improved with increases in the probability that a retrieved tag is reported.

Goose parvovirus (GPV), a small non-enveloped ssDNA virus, can cause Derzsy's disease, a highly contagious and lethal disease in goslings and muscovy ducklings, leading to a huge economic loss. However, little is known about the localization of B-cell epitopes on GPV structural protein. To address the issue, the structural protein of GPV was dissected into sets of partially overlapping fragments and expressed in Escherichia coli. Then Western blot reactivity of these glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion short peptides to viral infected sera was surveyed. The results showed linear immunodominant epitopes, which were found in seven fragments covering amino acid residues 35-71, 123-198, 423-444, 474-491, 531-566, 616-669, 678-732. Our findings may provide the basis for the development of immunity-based prophylactic, therapeutic, and diagnostic clinical techniques for Derzsy's disease.

Costs of parasitism are predicted to be higher with greater parasite intensities and higher inter-parasite competition (diversity). We tested whether greater helminth intensities and diversity were associated with poorer body composition (whole-body fat, protein, mineral and true body mass) in lesser snow geese, Chen caerulescens caerulescens. As part of a larger study on nutritional ecology, 828 wintering or migrating geese were shot between January and May 1983 in 27 different date-locations (samples) during their northward migration through mid-continental North America. A large proportion of overall variation in body composition and parasite communities was among samples, so we analyzed data within each of the 27 samples, controlling for structural body size (the first principal component of 10 body size measurements), sex and the age of geese. There was no compelling evidence that cestodes, trematodes or helminth diversity were associated with variation in body composition but nematodes had several negative associations with fat reserves. However, negative associations between fat reserves and nematodes occurred most often in geese collected between March and May when nematode prevalences and intensities were relatively low. This suggests several possibilities: that the most common nematodes (Heterakis dispar and Trichostrongylus tenuis) were more virulent at this time, that infected individuals had been chronically infected and suffered cumulative nutrient deficits that lasted until late in the spring migration, or that geese became more vulnerable to the effects of parasites at this time of year, possibly because they redirected resources away from immunity toward fat storage in preparation for reproduction.

Assortative mating occurs in the dimorphic lesser snow geese in the wild. Mixed matings between the blue and white phases are much less frequent than would be expected by chance. Evidence from marked birds in field conditions indicated that mate choice was correlated with familial color. Birds from white families usually chose white mates, birds from blue families usually chose blue mates, and birds from mixed families chose mates of either color. Similar results were obtained under captive conditions when offspring from foster families with particular parental and offspring color combinations were allowed to choose mates. Both parental color and sibling color appeared to influence mate choice. The bird's own color did not appear to be important in mate choice in either field or experimental conditions, and in those cases where male and female parents differed in color neither parental color was more influential than the other in determining offspring mate choice. The results provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, that mate selection based on familial appearance operates intraspecifically in the wild.

Using correlation analysis, Bêty, Gauthier, and Giroux confirmed that individuals of the migrating snow geese (Chen caerulescens atlantica) arriving earlier on their breeding grounds experienced longer prelaying periods but laid earlier than late-arriving birds. They concluded that these birds strategically adjusted timing to optimize fitness. This test is, however, not sufficient to indicate strategic behavior. We show analytically that, without assuming strategic behavior, arrival date, prelaying period, and laying date are correlated with each other because of their sequential occurrence. We conclude that correlation tests on sequentially occurring variables are not sufficient to detect nonrandom relations.

The long-distance migratory flights of birds are predominantly fueled by the oxidation of fatty acids, which are sourced primarily from extracellular adipose stores. These fatty acids have to be transported, via the circulatory system, to the mitochondria of the active muscles. An important facilitator of fatty acid transport within the cytoplasm of muscle cells is fatty acid binding protein (FABP), which serves as an intracellular carrier of long-chain fatty acids. In mammals, the muscular FABP content is related to the fatty acid oxidation capacity of the tissue. The aim of this study was to measure FABP in samples taken from the cardiac, pectoralis, and semimembranosus muscles of a long-distance avian migrant, the barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis), at various stages of development. Western blot analysis identified a single goose muscle protein of 15 kDa that was able to bind fatty acids and showed a 66% cross-reactivity with antibodies against human heart-type FABP. Captive goslings showed no significant changes in FABP content of either the heart (62.6 +/- 10.6 microgram/g wet wt) or the semimembranosus muscle (8.4 +/- 1.9 microgram/g wet wt) during development. However, in both peripheral and deep sites within the pectoralis muscle, FABP content of samples taken from captive goslings were approximately 10-fold higher throughout development and reached values of 30-40 microgram/g wet wt in fledging goslings at 7 wk of age. A further twofold higher value was seen in wild but not in captive goslings immediately before migration (12 wk of age). Similarly, FABP content was significantly higher in pectoralis samples taken from wild adults (94.3 +/- 3.6 microgram/g wet wt) compared with those from captive adults (60.5 +/- 3.6 micro/g wet wt). These results suggest that the experience of flight activity may be of critical importance in achieving maximal expression of FABP in the pectoralis muscles of postfledging and mature geese immediately before migration.

Infections with Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (B. dendrobatidis), the causal agent of chytridiomycosis, have been shown to play an important role in the decline of amphibians worldwide. Spread of the fungus is poorly understood. Bird movement might possibly contribute to the spread of B. dendrobatidis in the environment. Therefore, 397 wild geese in Belgium were screened for presence of B. dendrobatidis on their toes using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). In addition, chemotaxis towards, adhesion, survival after desiccation and proliferation of B. dendrobatidis on keratinous toe scales from waterfowl were examined in vitro. qPCR revealed that 76 geese (15%) were positive for B. dendrobatidis. Results of the in vitro tests showed that B. dendrobatidis is attracted to the keratinous toes of aquatic birds on which they can adhere and even proliferate. However, desiccation is poorly tolerated. This suggests waterfowl are potential environmental reservoirs for B. dendrobatidis.

Interferon γ receptor 1 (IFNGR1) and IFNGR2 are two cell membrane molecules belonging to class II cytokines, which play important roles in the IFN-mediated antiviral signaling pathway. Here, goose IFNGR1 and IFNGR2 were cloned and identified for the first time. Tissue distribution analysis revealed that relatively high levels of goose IFNγ mRNA transcripts were detected in immune tissues, including the harderian gland, cecal tonsil, cecum, and thymus. Relatively high expression levels of both IFNGR1 and IFNGR2 were detected in the cecal tonsil, which implicated an important role of IFNγ in the secondary immune system of geese. No specific correlation between IFNγ, IFNGR1, and IFNGR2 expression levels was observed in the same tissues of healthy geese. IFNγ and its cognate receptors showed different expression profiles, although they appeared to maintain a relatively balanced state. Furthermore, the agonist R848 led to the upregulation of goose IFNγ but did not affect the expression of goose IFNGR1 or IFNGR2. In summary, trends in expression of goose IFNγ and its cognate receptors showed tissue specificity, as well as an age-related dependency. These findings may help us to better understand the age-related susceptibility to pathogens in birds.

High-latitude ecosystems store large amounts of carbon (C); however, the C storage of these ecosystems is under threat from both climate warming and increased levels of herbivory. In this study we examined the combined role of herbivores and climate warming as drivers of CO2 fluxes in two typical high-latitude habitats (mesic heath and wet meadow). We hypothesized that both herbivory and climate warming would reduce the C sink strength of Arctic tundra through their combined effects on plant biomass and gross ecosystem photosynthesis and on decomposition rates and the abiotic environment. To test this hypothesis we employed experimental warming (via International Tundra Experiment [ITEX] chambers) and grazing (via captive Barnacle Geese) in a three-year factorial field experiment. Ecosystem CO2 fluxes (net ecosystem exchange of CO2, ecosystem respiration, and gross ecosystem photosynthesis) were measured in all treatments at varying intensity over the three growing seasons to capture the impact of the treatments on a range of temporal scales (diurnal, seasonal, and interannual). Grazing and warming treatments had markedly different effects on CO2 fluxes in the two tundra habitats. Grazing caused a strong reduction in CO2 assimilation in the wet meadow, while warming reduced CO2 efflux from the mesic heath. Treatment effects on net ecosystem exchange largely derived from the modification of gross ecosystem photosynthesis rather than ecosystem respiration. In this study we have demonstrated that on the habitat scale, grazing by geese is a strong driver of net ecosystem exchange of CO2, with the potential to reduce the CO2 sink strength of Arctic ecosystems. Our results highlight that the large reduction in plant biomass due to goose grazing in the Arctic noted in several studies can alter the C balance of wet tundra ecosystems. We conclude that herbivory will modulate direct climate warming responses of Arctic tundra with implications for the ecosystem C balance; however, the magnitude and direction of the response will be habitat-specific.

Cultural transmission of migratory traditions enables species to deal with their environment based on experiences from earlier generations. Also, it allows a more adequate and rapid response to rapidly changing environments. When individuals break with their migratory traditions, new population structures can emerge that may affect gene flow. Recently, the migratory traditions of the Barnacle Goose Branta leucopsis changed, and new populations differing in migratory distance emerged. Here, we investigate the population genetic structure of the Barnacle Goose to evaluate the consequences of altered migratory traditions. We used a set of 358 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers to genotype 418 individuals from breeding populations in Greenland, Spitsbergen, Russia, Sweden and the Netherlands, the latter two being newly emerged populations. We used discriminant analysis of principal components, FST , linkage disequilibrium and a comparison of geneflow models using migrate-n to show that there is significant population structure, but that relatively many pairs of SNPs are in linkage disequilibrium, suggesting recent admixture between these populations. Despite the assumed traditions of migration within populations, we also show that genetic exchange occurs between all populations. The newly established nonmigratory population in the Netherlands is characterized by high emigration into other populations, which suggests more exploratory behaviour, possibly as a result of shortened parental care. These results suggest that migratory traditions in populations are subject to change in geese and that such changes have population genetic consequences. We argue that the emergence of nonmigration probably resulted from developmental plasticity.

Natural populations are persistently exposed to environmental pollution, which may adversely impact animal physiology and behaviour and even compromise survival. Responding appropriately to any stressor ultimately might tip the scales for survival, as mistimed behaviour and inadequate physiological responses may be detrimental. Yet effects of legacy contamination on immediate physiological and behavioural stress coping abilities during acute stress are virtually unknown. Here, we assessed these effects in barnacle goslings ( Branta leucopsis) at a historical coal mine site in the Arctic. For three weeks we led human-imprinted goslings, collected from nests in unpolluted areas, to feed in an abandoned coal mining area, where they were exposed to trace metals. As control we led their siblings to feed on clean grounds. After submitting both groups to three well-established stress tests (group isolation, individual isolation, on-back restraint), control goslings behaved calmer and excreted lower levels of corticosterone metabolites. Thus, legacy contamination may decisively change stress physiology and behaviour in long-lived vertebrates exposed at a young age.

1. Experiments were conducted to determine the nitrogen (N) requirement for maintenance (N(m)) in Yangzhou goslings. 2. At 56 d old, 18 birds were divided into three equal groups and fed on diets with equal metabolisable energy (ME) and different contents of crude protein (CP; low, medium and high) in an N balance test. N(m) was estimated from the relationship between N output (N(E)) and N intake (N(I)). Following the above N balance test, 16 goslings at the same age were used in a N balance test with an N-free diet. The birds were divided into 4 equal groups and offered an N-free diet at intakes of 90, 70, 50 and 0 g per d, respectively. 3. The estimated N(m) was 240 mg/kg BW(0.75) per d in the N balance test. The result from the N-free diet trial gave a value of 244 mg/kg BW(0.75) per d, confirming the result of the N balance test. The lower intake of N-free diet resulted in more N(E), suggesting that protein catabolism may occur in the body of birds to meet N(m) when dietary N(I) was very low. 4. It was concluded that the N(m) of Yangzhou goslings was about 240 mg/kg BW(0.75).

In order to figure out the effect of ultrasound treatments (UT) on the tenderizing pathway of goose meat, breast muscles of 32 Eastern Zhejiang White Geese were treated with different ultrasound powers (the control, 300 and 600 W) at 40 kHz for 30 min. Shear force, cooking loss, myofibrillar fraction index (MFI), particle size, morphological analysis of actin filaments and the levels of F-actin and G-actin were investigated during 168 h storage. Results showed that 600 W group had the lowest shear force and cooking loss at 24, 48, 96 and 168 h among treatments, while 300 W UT decreased shear force and cooking loss compared to the control. UT increased MFI and induced myofibrillar small particles (D3,2) by disrupting actin filaments for myofibril and transforming of F-actin to G-actin compared to the control. We concluded that UT tenderized goose meat by fragmenting actin filaments and myofibrillar fraction.

Photoperiodic control is essential for manipulating the reproductive performance of avian species. This study was conducted to assess the neuroendocrine mechanisms that regulate reproductive functions of Yangzhou geese when there are different monochromatic light colors from light emitter diode (LED) sources. A flock of geese was divided into four groups with white, red, blue, and green light treatments being imposed. The results indicated that peak laying rates and reproductive performance were greater in geese treated with white or red as compared with blue or green light treatments. The fertilization rate of eggs and hatchability of fertilized eggs were greater with the white or red as compared with blue or green light treatments. There was a greater abundance of OPN5, Dio2, c-Fos, and GnRH-I mRNA in the hypothalamus earlier in the treatment period and abundances of these hypothalamic factors were greater with the white or red light treatments. Abundances of pituitary LH beta and FSH beta mRNA increased at a lesser rate with the blue or green light treatments and were in greater abundances with the white or red light treatments. The lighting regimen also resulted in photo-refractoriness with there being greater abundances of GnIH, VIP, and PRL mRNA with the use of white or red light treatments. The results indicate that the use of white or red monochromatic lights while imposing a long photoperiod of 11 h daily could result in sustaining functions of the reproductive system of Yangzhou geese for considerably longer times, thus, resulting in greater egg-laying performance.

The mechanical behavior of eggshell was determined in terms of average rupture force and corresponding deformation. For the experiment, we selected goose eggs (Anser anser f. domestica). Samples of eggs were compressed along their x-axis and z-axis. The effect of the loading orientation can be described in terms of the eggshell contour curvature. Two different experimental methods were used: compression between two plates (loading rates up to 5 mm/s) and the Hopkinson split pressure bar technique. This second method enables achieving loading rates up to about 17 m/s. The response of goose eggs to this high loading rate was characterized also by simultaneous measurement of the eggshell surface displacements using a laser vibrometer and by the measurement of both circumferential and meridian strains.

In the goose, alanine and arginine, intravenously or orally administered, act in the same way on pancreatic hormones; they both stimulate insulin and glucagon secretions. Conversely, whereas alanine treatment has no effect on plasma gut GLI, oral arginine stimulates gut GLI secretion. Since stimulation of gut GLI secretion does not occur with i.v. arginine, it may be assumed that this secretion depends on the intestinal transit of arginine and, as already described (Sitbon and Mialhe 1979), of glucose. The results, compared with studies on a similar species (duck) and on mammals, point out that i.v. infusion of alanine stimulates IRI and GLI secretions in the goose and not in the duck. In the same way, arginine i.v. infusion, contrarily to the observation made in the duck, is without effect on gut GLI secretion in the goose. Furthermore, insulin seems to be able to inhibit the alpha cell response to arginine infusion, as in mammals, whereas this is not the case in ducks.

In 5 trials using a total of 5367 geese (Deutsche Legagans male X White Italian Goose female), the influence of varying energy and crude protein levels in the feed on fattening performance was studied. After a uniform 4-week starter period (1st to 28th days of life) rations with conventional components were fed, their energy and crude protein levels ranging from 500 to 620 energetic feed equivalents (poultry) and 140 to 180 g CP, respectively. Subsequently, a test under commercial conditions was made to compare the optimal variant found (530 energetic feed equivalents-poultry/175 g CP) with a high-energy feed (620 energetic feed equivalents/175 g CP). As the energy concentration of the feed increased the live weight was not found to rise but slightly. At all energy levels under study, increasing crude protein from 140 to 180 g/5g resulted in higher gains. Feed expenditure was found to decrease as the energy concentration of the rations went up. High energy expenditure did not produce but slightly higher weight gains. Fattening beyond 56 days resulted in considerably higher energy expenditure.

1. The amino acid composition of the whole body protein of 28- and 56-day-old turkeys is reported. 2. There were some differences between the two ages; these could largely be reconciled by considering the likely differences in the proportion of feather protein. 3. The results were compared with similar values for the chicken and goose; overall there is a striking similarity, both in absolute concentrations and relative proportions of amino acids.

The effects of bilateral electrolytic lesions of the ventromedial hypothalamus (V.M.H.) were examined in male geese. In addition to the known effects (hyperphagia, obesity and liver steatosis), V.M.H. lesions slightly increased plasma insulin level in the fasting and the fed state and largely enhanced insulin levels observed during an oral glucose and amino acid load. Therefore, V.M.H. lesions potentiate insulin release which may in turn participate in the development of hyperphagia and fattening in the goose as in mammals.

From the early 1970s to the present, numerous cases of short beak and dwarfism syndrome (SBDS) have been reported in mule ducks from France. The animals showed strong growth retardation with smaller beak and tarsus. It was suggested that the syndrome was caused by goose parvovirus on the basis of serological investigation, but the causative agent has not been isolated and the disease has not so far been reproduced by experimental infection. The aim of the present study was to characterize the virus strains isolated from field cases of SBDS, and to reproduce the disease experimentally. Phylogenetic analysis proved that the parvovirus isolates obtained from SBDS of mule duck belonged to a distinct lineage of goose parvovirus-related group of waterfowl parvoviruses. The authors carried out experimental infections of 1-day-old, 2-week-old and 3-week-old mule ducks by the oral route with three different parvovirus strains: strain D17/99 of goose parvovirus from Derzsy's disease, strain FM of Muscovy duck parvovirus from the parvovirus disease of Muscovy ducks, and strain D176/02 isolated from SBDS of mule duck. The symptoms of SBDS of the mule duck could only be reproduced with the mule duck isolate (strain D176/02) following 1-day-old inoculation. Infection with a genetically different strain of goose parvovirus isolated from classical Derzsy's disease (D17/99) or with the Muscovy duck parvovirus strain (FM) did not cause any clinical symptoms or pathological lesions in mule ducks.

Embryos from aquatic birds are the primary models for the study of flipper development. While some staging of early embryogenesis in duck have been studied, characterization of the stages of the entire embryonic development period in water birds has not been described. This study aimed to establish a comparison of complete morphological development staging for ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and geese (Anser cygnoides) with the embryonic staging system by Hamburger and Hamilton (HH) for the chicken (Gallus gallus). Our results show that morphological development in the chicken, duck, and goose are similar in the early stages. The major differences occurred after stage 27 of embryonic development, where the beak shape in ducks and geese was wider and longer than in chickens. In addition, the second and third interdigital webs of the hind limb of the chicken were found to be degraded from stage 31, and eventually vanished at stage 35; however, they were retained in ducks and geese. Rapid physical development occurred in the mid-to-late stages in ducks and geese. To our best knowledge, this is the first description of complete embryonic development for the duck and goose. Establishment of an embryonic staging system for duck and goose provides new models for the study of waterfowl development.

Despite numerous studies on breeding dispersal, it is still unclear how habitat heterogeneity and previous nesting success interact to determine nest-site fidelity at various spatial scales. In this context, we investigated factors affecting breeding dispersal in greater snow geese (Anser caerulescens atlanticus), an Arctic breeding species nesting in two contrasting habitats (wetlands and mesic tundra) with variable pattern of snowmelt at the time of settlement in spring. From 1994 to 2005, we monitored the nesting success and breeding dispersal of individually marked females. We found that snow geese showed a moderate amount of nest-site fidelity and considerable individual variability in dispersal distance over consecutive nesting attempts. This variability can be partly accounted for by the annual timing of snowmelt. Despite this environmental constraint, habitat differences at the colony level consistently affected nesting success and settlement patterns. Females nesting in wetlands had higher nesting success than those nesting in mesic tundra. Moreover, geese responded adaptively to spatial heterogeneity by showing fidelity to their nesting habitat, independently of snowmelt pattern. From year to year, geese were more likely to move from mesic to high-quality wetland habitat, regardless of previous nesting success and without cost on their subsequent nesting performance. The unpredictability of snowmelt and the low cost of changing site apparently favour breeding-site dispersal although habitat quality promotes fidelity at the scale of habitat patches.

Openings of paleopulmonic parabronchi in paralyzed, unidirectionally ventilated geese were photographed through small holes in the birds' mediodorsal secondary bronchi during single-unit recording from intrapulmonary CO2 receptors. Changes in the discharge frequency of the receptors as fractional CO2 concentration of ventilating gas was alternated between 0 and 0.05 were compared with the changes in cross-sectional areas of randomly selected parabronchial lumina. Intrapulmonary CO2 receptors, similar to those found in other avian species, are also present in geese. Changes in intrapulmonary CO2 concentration greatly influenced the discharge of these receptors but did not induce movement of parabronchial smooth muscle in this region of the lung. If most of the receptors are located in the paleopulmonic parabronchi, as currently appears to be the case, we must conclude that changes in receptor discharge in response to changes in intrapulmonary CO2 concentration do not result from mechanical distortion of the receptors induced by smooth muscle contraction; intrapulmonary CO2 receptors appear to be true chemoreceptors.

Follicle maturation in the ovary of sexually mature domestic geese in the spring reproductive cycle was investigated by histological methods and steroid-RIA. The single-layer granulosa of primary follicles temporarily transformed in the growing white follicles into several layers or a simple membrana granulosa with nuclei at several different levels in the cell. In the yolky follicles the granulosa represents a cuboidal epithelium (F4-F3) and subsequently a high cylindrical epithelium (F1). The originally connective tissue-like cells of the theca interna show a glandular proliferation in the largest white (F7) and the small yolky follicles (F6-F5). Glandular cell nests in the theca externa are typical in the generation of small white follicles and are absent in the wall of yolky follicles. Progesterone-content in the follicular wall (granulosa + theca) is the highest in the F1-F2 and F6-F5 types and is low in small white follicles (F8, F9 and F10). E2 concentration shows only slight variations between F1-F10. TEST content shows a slight increase between F1 and F3 and is high in medium-sized white follicles (F8-F9). The results suggest that in addition to the granulosa, the theca interna is also capable of an intensive progesterone synthesis.

Dietary methionine (Met) restriction produces a coordinated series of transcriptional responses in the liver that limits growth performance and amino acid metabolism. Methyl donor supplementation with betaine (Bet) may protect against this disturbance and affect the molecular basis of gene regulation. However, a lack of genetic information remains an obstacle to understand the mechanisms underlying the relationship between Met and Bet supplementation and its effects on genetic mechanisms. The goal of this study was to identify the effects of dietary supplementation of Met and Bet on growth performance, transcriptomic gene expression, and epigenetic mechanisms in geese on a Met-deficient diet. One hundred and fifty 21-day-old healthy male Yangzhou geese of similar body weight were randomly distributed into 3 groups with 5 replicates per treatment and 10 geese per replicate: Met-deficient diet (Control), Control+1.2 g/kg of Met (Met), and Control+0.6 g/kg of Bet (Bet). All geese had free access to the diet and water throughout rearing. Our results indicated that supplementation of 1.2 g/kg of Met in Met-deficient feed increased growth performance and plasma homocysteine (HCY) levels, indicating increased transsulfuration flux in the liver. Supplementation of 0.6 g/kg Bet had no apparent sparing effect on Met needs for growth performance in growing geese. The expression of many genes critical for Met metabolism is increased in Met supplementation group. In the Bet-supplemented group, genes involved in energy production and conversion were up-regulated. Dietary supplementation with Bet and Met also altered DNA methylation. We observed changes in the methylation of the LOC106032502 promoter and corresponding changes in mRNA expression. In conclusion, Met and Bet supplementation in geese affects the transcriptional regulatory network and alters the hepatic DNA methylation of LOC106032502.

Hatch year (HY) mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) in the Coeur d'Alene (CDA) River Basin had higher concentrations of lead in their blood than HY Western Canada geese (Branta canadensis moffitti) (geometric means 0.98 versus 0.28 microg/g, wet weight). The pattern for adults of both species was similar, although geometric means (1.77 versus 0. 41 microg/g) were higher than in HY birds. HY mallards captured in the CDA River Basin in 1987 contained significantly lower lead concentrations in their blood than in 1994-95 (0.36 versus 0.98 microg/g); however, some very young mallards were sampled in 1987, and concentrations in adults were not significantly different in 1987, 1994, or 1995 (1.52, 2.07, 1.55 microg/g, respectively). Both species in the CDA River Basin in 1994-95 showed significantly reduced red blood cell delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) activity compared to the reference areas: Canada geese (HY -65.4 to -86.0%, adults -82.3%), and mallards (HY -90.7 to -95.5%, adults -94. 1%). Canada goose goslings were divided into size classes, and the two smaller classes from the CDA River Basin had significantly elevated free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (protoporphyrin) levels compared to the reference area (15.2x and 6.9x). HY and adult mallards both had significantly elevated protoporphyrin (5.9x and 7. 5x). Recognizing that interspecific differences exist in response and sensitivity to lead, it appears (at least for hemoglobin and hematocrit) that Canada geese were more sensitive to lead than mallards, i.e., adverse hematologic effects occur at lower blood lead concentrations. Only Canada geese from the CDA River Basin, in spite of lower blood lead concentrations, had significantly reduced mean hemoglobin and hematocrit values. No euthanized Canada geese (all HYs) from CDA River Basin were classified as clinically lead poisoned, but 38 Canada geese found dead in the CDA River Basin during a concurrent study succumbed to lead poisoning between 1992 and 1997. Only 6 (15.8%) of these 38 contained ingested lead shot, which contrasts greatly with the 75-94% incidence of ingested lead shot when mortality was due to lead shot ingestion. Lead from other contaminated sources (i.e., sediments and vegetation) in the CDA River Basin was strongly implicated in most Canada goose deaths. Based on the 31 live mallards and Canada geese collected in the CDA River Basin, which were representative of the live populations blood sampled only, the prevalence of subclinical and clinical lead poisoning (as determined by liver lead concentrations, excluding birds with ingested lead shot) was higher in mallards: subclinical (4 of 8, 50% HYs and 6 of 11, 55% adults); clinical (0% HYs and 4 of 11, 36% adults), with less data available for Canada geese (only 1 of 9, 11% HYs marginally subclinical). The clinically lead-poisoned mallards had extremely high concentrations of lead in blood (2.69-8. 82 microg/g) and liver (6.39-17.89 microg/g). Eight mallards found dead in the CDA River Basin during a concurrent study were diagnosed as lead poisoned, and only one (12.5%) contained ingested lead shot, which again strongly implicates other lead sources. The finding of dead lead poisoned Canada geese together with the high percentage of live mallards classified as subclinically or clinically lead poisoned, in combination with the low incidence of ingested lead shot causes us concern for both of these species, which live in association with lead-contaminated sediment in the CDA River Basin.

Goose embryos were infected with goose haemorrhagic polyomavirus (GHPV) onto the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) in order to examine the effect of GHPV on the embryos and to obtain data on whether embryos could develop into infected, virus-shedding goslings, as well as to present an accurate biological method for virus titration. The reported method of infection could offer a possibility to express the virus titre as the median embryo infective dose (EID(50)). As a special pathological feature of the disease, extensive cerebral haemorrhages were observed, which protruded the skullcap in many cases. Some embryos infected with 10(1.25) or 10(0.25) EID(50)/0.2 ml were able to hatch; however, they were in poor physical condition and died by post-hatching day 4 showing haemorrhagic nephritis and enteritis of geese. Virus shedding was revealed by polymerase chain reaction. The ability of some of the infected goose embryos to hatch may indicate the potency of GHPV to spread vertically, although this needs further study for confirmation.

Choanal cleft swab samples from 770 wild Canada geese (Branta canadensis) and 358 blue-winged teal (Anas discors), captured for relocation or banding, were examined for the presence of avian pneumovirus (APV) RNA by reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and for virus isolation. The swab samples were pooled into groups of 5 or 10. Sixty eight of 102 (66.7%) pooled goose samples were RT-PCR positive for APV RNA. Thirteen of 52 (25.0%) pooled blue-winged teal samples were RT-PCR positive for APV RNA. APV RNA-positive samples were inoculated onto chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF) and QT-35 cells. Infectious APV was isolated from five Canada goose pooled samples in CEF and from one Canada goose pool in QT-35 cells but not from blue-winged teal.

All birds reproduce by internal fertilization, but only 3% of birds have external genitalia. Hormone secretions and body size influence genital growth, but the actual regulatory mechanism is rarely reported. Thus, using 35 geese as experimental material, the regulatory mechanism of goose external genitalia growth was explored by measuring body size parameters, serum hormone concentrations, and related gene expression. In this study, genital growth was different among tested geese, but histological and morphological results showed that all geese external genitalia contained complete tissues. Measurements of hormone levels showed that at puberty, as the genital length increased, irregular decreases were observed in the levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), whereas an irregular increase was observed in the levels of testosterone (T); furthermore, the levels of testosterone (T) gradually increased to a peak at 34 weeks. Based on RT-PCR results, as the genital length increased, only the expression of 17α-hydroxylase/17, 20-lyase (CYP17) mRNA slightly decreased at first, and then significantly increased to a peak, whereas the expression patterns of other genes were irregular. Furthermore, the CYP17 immunohistochemistry results also showed a pattern that was highly consistent with the patterns of mRNA expression and T secretion. In addition, based on body measurements, as body weight increased, the genital length increased. Thus, these results suggested that the CYP17 gene plays a key role in goose genital growth.

The cytokine interleukin (IL)-2 functions as a growth factor and central regulator in the immune system. Using a recombinant goose IL-2 (goIL-2) monomer expressed in prokaryotic cells as an immunogen, we synthesized 5 goIL-2 neutralizing mAbs to identify the functional domains of goIL-2, and used these mAbs to finely map the functional domains of the goIL-2 protein. The mimotopes of the 5 anti-goIL-2 mAbs, including HHDPWDXLP, ESLSRXXMXXLXP, SHHLPTSXL, HPDPWDAPLSS, and HEPWQLXL, were identified using a phage display library and peptide-competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). These mimotopes constitute 1 conformational functional domain in the goIL-2 molecule--T¹¹I¹⁴K¹⁵D¹⁶E¹⁸K¹⁹L²⁰G²¹T²²S²³M²⁴K²⁵L²⁹E³⁰L³¹Y³²T³³P³⁴E³⁶S⁴¹W⁴²Q⁴³T⁴⁴L⁴⁵Q⁴⁶ (domain I). The neutralizing mAbs to goIL-2 inhibited the in vitro lymphocyte proliferation stimulated by domain I peptides of goIL-2. A tertiary structural model of goIL-2 showed that domain I is positioned in helix A, long A-B loop, and the N-terminal of helix B. These data provide a clue for defining the interaction between goIL-2 and its receptor.

Animals adaptively regulate their metabolic rate and hence energy expenditure over the annual cycle to cope with energetic challenges. We studied energy management in greylag geese. In all geese, profound seasonal changes of heart rate (fH) and body temperature (Tb) showed peaks in summer and troughs during winter, and also daily modulation of fH and Tb. Daily mean fH was on average 22% lower at the winter trough than at the summer peak, whereas daily mean Tb at the winter trough was only about 1 °C below the summer peak. Daily means of Tb together with those of air temperature and day length were the most important predictors of daily mean fH, which was further modulated by precipitation, reproductive state, and, to a minor degree, social rank. Peaks of fH and Tb occurred earlier in incubating females compared to males. Leading goslings increased daily mean fH. Our results suggest that in greylag geese, pronounced changes of fH over the year are caused by photoperiod-induced changes of endogenous heat production. Similar to large non-hibernating mammals, tolerance of lower Tb during winter seems the major factor permitting this. On top of these major seasonal changes, fH and Tb are elevated in incubating females.

The objective of the present experiments was to produce the intergeneric hybrids of domesticated and wild goose via artificial insemination with fresh and frozen-thawed semen. The experiments were carried out during two successive goose reproductive seasons, on eight five-year-old Canada Goose (Branta canadensis L.) males used as semen donors and 16 two-year-old White Kołuda geese designated to fertility tests. Pooled semen was collected twice a week by the dorso-abdominal massage. In freshly collected semen, ejaculate volume, color, consistency, degree of fecal or blood contamination, spermatozoa concentration, motility, and morphology were evaluated. Part of the semen collected in the first year of the experiment (Experiment 1) was used for geese insemination with fresh semen, while the remainder was frozen. In Experiment 2 all samples were subjected exclusively to freezing procedure. Geese were inseminated once a week with fresh semen in a dose of 80 μl or 160 μl, and twice a week with frozen-thawed semen in a dose of 80 μl (160 μl per wk) or 100 μl (200 μl per wk). Eggs were set weekly and incubated up to hatching. The volume of ejaculates varied from 0.100 to 0.470 ml; spermatozoa concentration from 140 to 310 million ml(-1); progressive movement was observed in 40 to 60% of spermatozoa; the percentage of total live spermatozoa ranged from 69.3 to 92.0%, the highest percentage (34.0-68.3) was represented by live normal spermatozoa and those with bulb-head (13.3-41.0). Cryopreservation caused a decrease in percentage of motile cells to 30%; total live spermatozoa contribution by 27.2%p, including those live normal by 15.9%p (in relation to the fresh semen), bulb-head spermatozoa by 10.9%p, and increase (by 5.9%p) in number of spermatozoa with other deformations. Goose insemination 1×/week with fresh semen containing about 10.3 million live normal spermatozoa resulted in 66.7% of fertile eggs and with dose higher by 2.8 million spermatozoa (on average) the fertility increased by 20.9%p (up to 87.6% on average). Hatchability from set and fertile eggs was 55.9% and 83.9% vs. 66.3% and 75.6%, respectively. After twice a week insemination with frozen-thawed semen containing about 10.2 million live normal cells 58.2% eggs were fertile; hatchability from set eggs was 42.8% and from fertile eggs 71.7%, while insemination dose increase by 2.7 million spermatozoa per week caused a fertilization increase by 3.8%p (62.0% on average), this increase was not statistically significant, but hatchability from the fertile eggs (95.4%), was significantly (P < 0.05) higher. The use of AI with fresh semen in the creation of intergeneric hybrids of Canada goose males and White Kołuda females allows a high level of egg fertility to be obtained. Furthermore, one limitation which is the short reproductive season of the Canada goose may be overcome by the use of cryopreserved semen.

In an analysis of capture-recapture data, the identification of a model that fits is a critical step. For the multisite (also called multistate) models used to analyze data gathered at several sites, no reliable test for assessing fit is currently available. We propose a test for the JMV model, a simple generalization of the Arnason-Schwarz (AS) model, in the form of interpretable contingency tables. For the AS model, we suggest complementing the test for the JMV model with a likelihood ratio test of AS vs. JMV. The examination of an example leads us to propose further a partitioning that emphasizes the role of the memory model of Brownie et al. (1993 Biometrics 49, 1173-1187) as a biologically more plausible alternative to the AS model.

To select the molecular genetic markers related to egg performance of Wanjiang white goose, prolactin receptor gene (PRLR) was adopted to be a candidate gene in our study. Five pairs of primers (P1-P5) were designed to detect the SNPs of PRLR gene by PCR-SSCP method. The results revealed that polymorphisms were discovered in the PCR products amplified with P4 primers in PRLR exon 10, three genotypes were found: AA, AB and AC. The sequence of AB genotype is the same as original sequence (DQ660982) in NCBI. There are five mutations in AA genotype: C→A at 840 bp, C→T at 862 bp, T→C at 875 bp, T→A at 963 bp, A→T at 989 bp, resulting in amino acid mutations: His→Asn, Thr→Ile, Asn→Lys, Thr→Ser, and synonymous mutation at 875 bp. Sequencing revealed five mutations in AC genotype: G→T at 816 bp, A→T at 861 bp, C→T at 862 bp, T→C at 875 bp, A→G at 948 bp, causing amino acid mutations of Val→Phe, Thr→Phe, synonymous mutations at 875 and 963 bp. Besides, there are an N-glycosylation site (NQSR), three casein kinase II phosphorylation sites including SIIE, SKTE, and SLMD in AA genotype; three casein kinase II phosphorylation sites including SIIE, SKTE, and TLMD in AB genotype; three casein kinase II phosphorylation sites including SIFE, SKTE, and TLMD in AC genotype. The annual egg yielding of AB genotype geese are significantly more than those of AA and AC genotype geese on the average (P<0.05). It is suggested for the first time that PRLR is a promising candidate gene that can affect egg performance in Wanjiang white goose.

Gray geese of the bar-headed type (Anser indicus synonym: Eulabeia indica) perform trans-Himalayan migratory flight at extreme altitude. The physiological mechanisms include hyperventilation of cold air, increased lung diffusion capacity, proton gradients, high muscular temperature, amino acid mutation in haemoglobin and cytochrome oxidase, re-location of mitochondria, and extreme shifts in the oxy-haemoglobin dissociation curve due to Bohr- and temperature effects. The second annual migration takes place in late autumn, and the bar-headed geese come home in due time before Christmas.

Lysozyme g is an antibacterial enzyme that was first found in the eggs of some birds, but recently has been found in additional species, including non-vertebrates. Some previously characterized lysozyme g sequences are suggested to have altered secretion potential and enzymatic activity, however the distribution of these altered sequences is unknown. Duplicated copies of the lysozyme g gene exist in some species; however, the origins of the duplicates and their roles in altered function are unclear.

A bird species is regarded as alien invasive if it has been introduced, intentionally or accidentally, to a location where it did not previously occur naturally, becomes capable of establishing a breeding population without further intervention by humans, spreads and becomes a pest affecting the environment, the local biodiversity, the economy and/or society, including human health. European Starling (Sturnus vulgaris), Common Myna (Acridotheres tristis) and Red-vented Bulbul (Pycnonotus cafer) have been included on the list of '100 of the World's Worst Invasive Alien Species', a subset of the Global Invasive Species Database. The 'Delivering Alien Invasive Species Inventories for Europe' project has selected Canada Goose (Branta canadensis), Ruddy Duck (Oxyura jamaicensis), Rose-ringed Parakeet (Psittacula krameri) and Sacred Ibis (Threskiornis aethiopicus) as among 100 of the worst invasive species in Europe. For each of these alien bird species, the geographic range (native and introduced range), the introduction pathway, the general impacts and the management methods are presented.

An experiment was conducted using a total of 540 one-day-old Yangzhou geese to study the effect of rearing system on growth performance, carcass traits, and meat quality of male and female Yangzhou geese. The birds were divided into homogeneous groups according to initial BW and sex. The male and female geese were raised in separate pens under 5 different treatments, with 3 replicate pens of 18 male or 18 female geese per pen for each treatment. This experiment included 2 stages, with geese at 1 to 28 d of age (the first stage) and 29 to 70 d of age (the second stage). The 5 different treatments were 1) system A (geese raised on a wire floor), 2) system B (geese raised on the floor), 3) system C (geese raised on the floor and transferred to to a wire floor), 4) system D (geese raised on a wire floor and transferred to the floor), and 5) system E (geese raised on the floor and transferred to a free range). Results showed that feed conversion rate, BW, and BW gain were significantly affected by rearing system and sex (P < 0.05). For carcass yield, results suggested that eviscerated carcass yield and heart yield were affected by rearing system (P < 0.05) but not by sex (P > 0.05). Differences between sexes, but not rearing systems, were observed for only breast yield, thigh yield, and liver yield (P < 0.05). Rearing system and sex had a remarkable effect (P < 0.05) on subcutaneous fat thickness, abdominal fat yield, and gizzard yield. The nutrient composition (water, protein, and fat), water-holding capacity, shear force, and pH of the pectoralis major muscle were not affected (P > 0.05) by the rearing system, and only water, protein, and pH of the meat were affected by sex (P < 0.05). This study indicates that rearing system A, in which Yangzhou geese were raised on a wire floor, improved growth performance but had little effect on meat quality, implying that the use of rearing system A, using a wire floor, might be feasible and effective for Yangzhou geese.

The primary structures of the alpha- and beta-chains from greylag goose (Anser anser) hemoglobin are given. The sequence was deduced automatically in the sequenator. They differ from chicken alpha-chains in the exchange of 30, from beta-chains in the exchange of only 8 amino acid residues, respectively. The contact points of inositol pentaphosphate with the beta-chains are identical in chicken and greylag goose. Unequal evolution of the beta-chains was found, which is published here for the first time. By comparing the sequences of chicken and greylag goose and considering paleontological data, we found the mutation rate of the alpha-chains to be normal, i.e. 6 million years/mutation. This corresponds to the values for other species. The mutation rate of beta-chains is reduced and was calculated at 25 million years/mutation. This is possibly due to a specific function of beta-chains. This paper is the basis of our attempt to explain on a molecular basis the ability of bar-headed goose (Anser indicus) to fly and breathe at high altitudes.

The effects of environmental perturbations or stressors on individual states can be carried over to subsequent life stages and ultimately affect survival and reproduction. The concentration of corticosterone (CORT) in feathers is an integrated measure of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity during the molting period, providing information on the total baseline and stress-induced CORT secreted during the period of feather growth. Common eiders and greater snow geese replace all flight feathers once a year during the pre-basic molt, which occurs following breeding. Thus, CORT contained in feathers of pre-breeding individuals sampled in spring reflects the total CORT secreted during the previous molting event, which may provide insight into the magnitude or extent of stress experienced during this time period. We used data from multiple recaptures to disentangle the contribution of individual quality vs. external factors (i.e., breeding investment or environmental conditions) on feather CORT in arctic-nesting waterfowl. Our results revealed no repeatability of feather CORT within individuals of either species. In common eiders, feather CORT was not affected by prior reproductive investment, nor by pre-breeding (spring) body condition prior to the molting period. Individual feather CORT greatly varied according to the year, and August-September temperatures explained most of the annual variation in feather CORT. Understanding mechanisms that affect energetic costs and stress responses during molting will require further studies either using long-term data or experiments. Although our study period encompassed only five years, it nonetheless provides evidence that CORT measured in feathers likely reflects responses to environmental conditions experienced by birds during molt, and could be used as a metric to study carry-over effects.

Zygote development and oocyst wall formation of Eimeria truncata occurred in epithelial cells in renal tubules and ducts of experimentally infected lesser snow geese (Anser c. caerulescens). Post-fertilization stages were present throughout the kidneys beginning nine days post-inoculation. Initially, a single plasmalemma enclosed the zygote, and type 1 wall-forming bodies (WF1) became labyrinthine and moved toward the surface. There, WF1 degranulated and formed the outer layer of the oocyst wall between the plasmalemma and a newly formed second subpellicular membrane. Several WF2 fused and formed the inner layer of the oocyst wall between the third and fourth subpellicular membranes. Six subpellicular membranes were observed during wall formation. Other features of oocyst development were similar to those of other eimerian species.

In group-living animals, social context is known to modulate physiology, behaviour and reproductive output as well as foraging and nutritional strategies. Here we investigate the digestive efficiency of 38 individuals belonging to different social categories of a semi-feral and individually marked flock of greylag geese (Anser anser). During 9 consecutive days in winter 2017, when the ground was fully covered with snow (i.e. no grass or other natural forage available) and the accessible food was standardized, 184 individual droppings were collected and analysed to estimate the apparent digestibility of organic matter (ADOM). Lignin was used as an indigestible internal marker in the food and droppings. The digestive efficiency was higher in pairs with offspring as compared to pairs without offspring or unpaired birds. Furthermore, individuals with high ADOM were more likely to breed successfully in the following season than those with low ADOM. Our findings demonstrate that social status modulates digestive efficiency, probably via a chain of physiological mechanisms including a dampened stress response in individuals enjoying stable social relationships with and social support by their family members (i.e. their own pair-partner and offspring). Our findings underline the importance of the social network in modulating physiology, such as digestive efficiency, and ultimately reproductive success.

The gene encoding VP1 capsid protein of a goose parvovirus was cloned into a baculovirus transfer vector and a recombinant baculovirus was produced. The recombinant virus expressed a protein of 88 kDa corresponding to the molecular weight of VP1 protein and the protein was detected by immunoblotting. By indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test, the expressed protein was detected in the nucleus of the insect cells as big granules and electron microscopy also showed several big granules in the nucleus infected with the recombinant virus. The IFA test was developed for screening antibody in Muscovy ducks.

Two groups of arylsulphatases: anionic and cationic were isolated and purified from goose gonads and spleen. The cationic arylsulphatases were predominant. In either group, several forms of arylsulphatase were distinguished, their kinetic parameters, susceptibility to activators and inhibitors, and molecular mass were determined. The cationic and anionic forms corresponded, respectively, to arylsulphatases A and B of mammalian tissues. The differences found demonstrate organ heterogeneity of arylsulphatases.

Inhibin alpha is one of the candidate genes that control the ovulation in poultry. To study the genetic effects of inhibin alpha on apoptosis and proliferation of goose granulosa cells cultured in vitro, two RNA interference (RNAi) expression vectors, psiRNA-INH alpha 1 and psiRNA-INH alpha 2, were constructed to knock down inhibin alpha gene expression. After 48 h of transfection, the efficiency of these two RNAi expression vectors was examined by fluorescence microscopy. Meanwhile, inhibin protein expression levels, apoptosis indexes (AI) and proliferation indexes (PI) of granulosa cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. In addition, the supernatants were collected to assay the concentrations of estrogen (E2) and progesterone (P) by radioimmunoassay. The results showed that the expression level of inhibin alpha in the RNAi group were decreased 30%-40% than those in the control groups (P < 0.05) and the apoptosis indexes and proliferation indexes in the RNAi groups were significantly higher than those in the control groups (P < 0.05). However, the E2 concentrations in the RNAi groups were lower than those in the control groups (P < 0.05). These results indicate that inhibin alpha has antagonistic effect on granulosa cell apoptosis.

With a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, goose parvovirus (GPV) DNA was detected in Muscovy ducklings inoculated with attenuated GPV strains, IH and IHC. Strain IH that had been passed 20 times in Muscovy duck embryos could be detected in ducklings at 2- to 28-days after oral inoculation by PCR, however, a cell culture adapted strain IHC that had been passed 15 times in Muscovy duck embryos and then successively 50 times in Muscovy duck embryo fibroblasts could not be detected by 6 days postinoculation by the oral route, but via intramuscular inoculation the virus was detected from 6 dpi. With both strains Muscovy ducklings produced neutralizing antibodies against GPV, but GPV could be recovered from heart muscles even in birds that had high titer of neutralizing antibody. This means that GPV remains in birds for a long period under the presence of high titer of neutralizing antibody in the serum. Recovery of the virus was consistent with PCR results with one exception in which the bird had a neutralizing antibody titer of more than 100,000. After inoculation of these strains, no clinical signs were detected in ducklings. These results suggest that strains IH and IHC can be candidates for live attenuated vaccine for GPV infection.

Studies on organ homogenates of 22 one-year-old healthy geese indicated ubiquiternal distribution of GOT and GPT transaminases, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline and acid phosphatase, aldolase and kreatine phosphokinase, without the presence of any pronounced organ specificity of some of the named enzymes. It is presumed that the investigation on these enzymes in goose blood serum can be of use only for determining the degree and the course of a given disease, but not for organ-localization of the disease's process.

As interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins 1 and 3 (IFITM1 and IFITM3) can effectively inhibit the replication of multiple viruses. Here, goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 were cloned and identified for the first time. The two proteins share the same topological structure and several important sites critical for the antiviral functions in other species are conserved in the goose. Goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 are most closely related to their respective orthologs in ducks; these proteins exhibited high mRNA transcript levels in immune-related tissues, including the thymus, bursa of Fabricius, and Harderian gland, compared to other tissues. Moreover, goose IFITM1 was highly constitutively expressed in gastrointestinal tract tissues, while goose IFITM3 was expressed in respiratory organs. Furthermore, goose IFITM3 was activated in goose peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) infected with Tembusu virus (TMUV) or treated with Toll-like receptors (TLRs) agonists, while only the R848 and Poly (I:C) agonists induced significant upregulation of goose IFITM1. Furthermore, goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 were upregulated in the sampled tissues, to some extent, after TMUV infection. Notably, significant upregulation of goose IFITM1 and IFITM3 was detected in the cecum and cecal tonsil, where TMUV was primarily distributed. These data provide new insights into the immune effectors in geese and promote our understanding of the role of IFITM1 and IFITM3 in the defense against TMUV.

The studies conducted aimed at evaluating the genetic diversity within and between varieties of conservative flocks of geese, using the polymorphism of 14 microsatellite sequences. The experimental material included conservative flocks of geese the following indigenous breeds and varieties kept in Poland: Kielecka (Ki), Kartuska (Ka), Lubelska (Lu), Suvalska (Su), Rypinska (Ry), Sub-Carpathian (SC), Hunched Beak (HB) and Pomeranian (Po). Among the 14 microsatellite sequences a total of 97 microsatellite alleles were identified. The number of alleles at one locus ranged from 3 to 19. In the overall pool of 97 alleles, 26 (26.8%) were specific for individual breeds and varieties of geese. The values of the expected heterozygosity (He) for individual geese ranged from 0.38 (Sub-Carpathian) to 0.51 (HB). Similarly, the mean values for the observed heterozygosity (Ho) ranged from 0.45 (Po) to 0.55 (Ki and Su). The polymorphic information content reached the highest value of 0.80 at loci CKW21 (Ki) and TTUCG5 (Po and Su). The greatest genetic distance was observed between the HB and Ry (0.44) and between the HB and Po (0.39) varieties, while the smallest-between the Lu and Po as well as Lu and Ki (0.028) varieties. The phylogenetic tree, elaborated on the basis of the genetic distances, clearly confirms the specificity of the HB goose as compared to the remaining breeds and varieties.

Despite observational evidence of carry-over effects (COEs, events occurring in one season that produce residual effects on individuals the following seasons), to our knowledge no experimental studies have been carried out to explore how COEs might affect reproductive output. We simulated an environmental perturbation affecting spring-staging migrants to investigate COEs in greater snow geese (Anser caerulescens atlanticus). During three consecutive years, 2037 females captured during spring staging (approx. 3000 km south of their Arctic breeding grounds) were maintained in captivity (with or without access to food) for 0-4 days. Duration of captivity (but not food treatment) negatively affected reproductive success, probably through stress response. Reproductive success was reduced by 45-71% in 2 years, but not in a third year with unusually favourable breeding conditions. This unprecedented manipulation indicates that COEs can have a strong effect on individual reproductive success in long-distance migrants, but that this effect can be partly compensated for by good environmental conditions on the breeding ground.

Ornithine decarboxylase antizyme 1 (OAZ1) regulates both polyamine biosynthesis and transport and acts as a tumor suppressor because of its functions in the regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis and growth. However, the roles of OAZ1 in the regulation of polyamine metabolism, cell proliferation, apoptosis and hormone receptor expression in granulosa cells (GCs) from geese have not been determined. To define the roles of OAZ1 in primary GCs, we constructed and transfected an Oaz1 overexpression vector with a thymidine deletion into primary GCs. Oaz1 overexpression induced 65 and 30% decreases in the putrescine and spermidine contents, respectively, 225% increase in the spermine content and up-regulated the expression levels of genes associated with polyamine metabolism (but Oaz2). The Ccnd1, Pcna, Bax and Caspase 3 mRNA expression levels in GCs overexpressing Oaz1 were significantly higher than the expression levels in the vehicle group (p < 0.05). Additionally, a slight increase in the E2 concentration in the culture medium and enhanced Er, Fshr and Lhr expression were observed in the GCs 24 h after Oaz1 overexpression (p < 0.05). These data suggested that Oaz1 up-regulated the expression of genes related to polyamine metabolic enzymes and reproductive hormone receptors, disturbed intracellular polyamine homeostasis, and affected the transcription of genes associated to cell proliferation and apoptosis in goose primary GCs. Taken together, our results indicate that modifying polyamine metabolism by Oaz1 may interfere with the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis and responsiveness of ovary toward hormones in goose GCs.

Aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria from the intestinal tracts of swans and geese were isolated and characterized as part of a larger study of the microbiological effects of migratory waterfowl on water quality. A total of 356 isolates were identified by using rapid identification methods and classified by using numerical taxonomy. A diverse population of bacteria was recovered from the waterfowl, and representative strains could be classified into 21 phena. The majority of the aerobic, heterotrophic bacteria found in the gut of the waterfowl were species of Enterobacteriaceae. Streptococcus. Lactobacillus, and Bacillus. Unfortunately, the birds that were examined did not harbor significant numbers of any waterfowl-specific bacterial species. Thus, it may not be possible to assess microbiological impact of migratory waterfowl by using and "indicator" species since avian fecal pollution could not be distinguished from animal and human fecal pollution.

Pheasant hemoglobin is heterogenous and contains two components: a major one called HbA (70% of total amount) and a minor one called HbD (25% of total amount). HbA contains alpha A-chain, while HbD contains alpha D-chain. The amino acid sequences of both hemoglobins are given. The sequences were determined by automatic Edman degradation of tryptic peptides and peptides obtained by specific chemical cleavages. Between alpha A- and alpha D-chains a large difference of 57 amino acids was found. The primary structures of beta-chains from both hemoglobins are identical. The alpha A-chains contain no tryptophan, only one methionine and two cysteines. The alpha D-chains contain one tryptophan, four methionines and one cysteine. By homologous comparison with greylag goose hemoglobin the alpha A-chains differ by 19 exchanges, beta-chains by 7 exchanges. The alpha D-chains differ by 10 exchanges in comparison to alpha D-chains from chicken hemoglobin D. In the alpha A-chains valine was found to position alpha 63 (E12) as was the case for alpha-chains of barheaded goose. In the alpha D-chains however leucine was found in this position.

Climate change and human activities cause uncertain changes to species biodiversity by altering their habitat. The uncertainty of climate change requires planners to balance the benefit and cost of making conservation plan. Here optimal protection approach for Lesser White-fronted Goose (LWfG) by coupling Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and Marxan selection were proposed. MPT was used to provide suggested weights of investment for protected area (PA) and reduce the influence of climatic uncertainty, while Marxan was utilized to choose a series of specific locations for PA. We argued that through combining these two commonly used techniques with the conservation plan, including assets allocation and PA chosing, the efficiency of rare bird's protection would be enhanced. In MPT analyses, the uncertainty of conservation-outcome can be reduced while conservation effort was allocated in Hunan, Jiangxi and Yangtze River delta. In Marxan model, the optimal location for habitat restorations based on existing nature reserve was identified. Clear priorities for the location and allocation of assets could be provided based on this research, and it could help decision makers to build conservation strategy for LWfG.

Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test using goose erythrocytes (GRBC) is the method of choice for screening antibodies to various arboviruses. This test makes use of fresh GRBC preserved in dextrose-gelatin-veronal (DGV). We have tried formalinizing GRBC and have found that such cells can retain the surface property of being agglutinated by arboviruses and, therefore, can be used in haemagglutination (HA) and HI tests. Unlike fresh cells preserved in DGV, formalinized cells can be preserved for a long time without haemolysis or loss of sensitivity. They can also be frozen or lyophilized. Making use of these properties, a kit has been developed for the assay of HI antibodies to some members of the flavivirus group. Use of this kit simplifies the HI test and enables it to be carried out routinely by any hospital or laboratory to screen arboviral infections.

The relative impact of top-down control by herbivores and bottom-up control by environmental conditions on vegetation is a subject of debate in ecology. In this study, we hypothesize that top-down control by goose foraging and bottom-up control by sediment accretion on vegetation composition within an ecosystem can co-occur but operate at different spatial and temporal scales. We used a highly dynamic marsh system with a large population of the Greylag goose (Anser anser) to investigate the potential importance of spatial and temporal scales on these processes. At the local scale, Greylag geese grub for below-ground storage organs of the vegetation, thereby creating bare patches of a few square metres within the marsh vegetation. In our study, such activities by Greylag geese allowed them to exert top-down control by setting back vegetation succession. However, we found that the patches reverted back to the initial vegetation type within 12 years. At large spatial (i.e. several square kilometres) and temporal scales (i.e. decades), high rates of sediment accretion surpassing the rate of local sea-level rise were found to drive long-term vegetation succession and increased cover of several climax vegetation types. In summary, we conclude that the vegetation composition within this tidal marsh was primarily controlled by the bottom-up factor of sediment accretion, which operates at large spatial as well as temporal scales. Top-down control exerted by herbivores was found to be a secondary process and operated at much smaller spatial and temporal scales.

Human minisatellite probes cross-hybridize to DNA of several species of poultry (chicken, duck, turkey and goose), and detect high levels of polymorphism. The resulting DNA fingerprints are individual specific, and allow the discrimination even between closely related birds. The pattern of poultry DNA fingerprints is different from that of humans and other animals, having a higher average proportion of large DNA fragments. Pedigree analysis revealed a low number of allelic pairs of variable DNA fragments, indicating that most of the alleles are unresolved in the DNA fingerprint or too small to be detected. The total number of detectable loci in broilers, using probe 33.6, was estimated as 62, of which 13 loci are on average scoreable and available for use. Poultry DNA fingerprints can be used for individual identification, linkage studies and as an aid in breeding programmes.

The segmentum accelerans in geese is a constriction in the caudal end of the primary bronchus. Experimental evidence suggests that this part of the airway functions as an inspiratory aerodynamic valve, accelerating the incoming airstream past the ventrobronchial openings. The luminal diameter of the segmentum accelerans dilates in the presence of elevated CO2 levels, probably through relaxation of smooth muscle.

By means of a complex technique some structural and blood supply peculiarities of the valve apparatus have been studied in 118 hearts of 8 representatives of domestic (Anser domesticus, Anas domestica) and wild (Cygnus olor, Cygnus sygnus, Chenopsis atrata, Anser anser, Anas platyrhynchos, Anas strepera) waterfowls. The investigations have demonstrated that in all the waterfowl studied the right atrioventricular ostia have only one cusp consisting mainly of transversal-striated muscular fibers. In the muscular valve, a dense vascular network and elements of the conducting system--Purkine's fibers have been determined. The main bulk of blood vessels penetrate the left atrio-ventricular valve, the aortal and pulmonary stem valves having transversal-striated muscular fibers. A part of vessels can be detected in the connective tissue stroma of the valves. In wild birds, the valve cusps possess more powerful bundles of muscular fibers and a much denser capillary network.

To investigate the mechanism of avian influenza outbreak wildly in water fowls, the co-pathogens, especially that caused immuno-depression were studied. A pair of degenerated primers, which amplified a fragment of 552bp in length, was designed and synthesized based on the published goose and other Circovirus sequences. The specific PCR product was amplified from the goose sample of Yongkang avian influenza case of Zhejiang Province. The fragment was then sequenced and the result showed the existence of the GoCV. The opposite part of the genome was further amplified using inverse primers designed based on the 552bp sequence obtained and the 1821bp full length genomic sequence of GoCV-yk01 was compiled using Seqman program of DNAStar. Sequence analysis showed that the GoCV-yk01 possessed common features of circovirus included potential replication associated stem-loop structure and the Rep protein motifs. Homology analysis showed that the sequence of GoCV-yk01 had 91% approximately 93% similarity to that of Taiwan and Germany strains. Phylogenetic analysis with ClustalW, however, showed that the GoCV-yk01 was on a different branch away from Taiwan and Germany strains. Circovirus usually causes immuno-depression and results in secondary infection, as it infects rapid growing cells as lymphocyte. It is speculated that the infection of GoCV may be a part of the reason of the avian influenza outbreak of the Yongkang case. The GoCV-yk01 is the first GoCV strain reported in mainland of China.

Fecal droppings of migratory Canada geese, Branta canadensis, collected from nine sites near the Chesapeake Bay (Maryland), were examined for the presence of Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia spp. Cryptosporidium sp. oocysts were found in feces at seven of nine sites, and Giardia cysts were found at all nine sites. The oocysts from three sites were infectious for mice and molecularly identified as the zoonotic genotype of Cryptosporidium parvum. Waterfowl can disseminate infectious C. parvum oocysts in the environment.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the changes in the goose embryo transcriptome during feather development. RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) was used to find the transcriptome profiles of feather follicles from three stages of embryonic dorsal skin at embryonic day 13, 18, and 28 (E13, E18, E28). The results showed that 3001, 6634, and 13,780 genes were differently expressed in three stages. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in E13 vs. E18 were significantly mapped into the GO term of extracellular structure organization and the pathway of extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction. In E18 vs. E28, the top significantly mapped into GO term was the single-organism developmental process; the pathway was also the ECM-receptor interaction. DEGs in E13 vs. E28 were significantly mapped into the GO term of the multicellular organismal process and the pathway of cell adhesion molecules. Subsequently, the union of DEGs was categorized by succession cluster into eight profiles, which were then grouped into four ideal profiles. Lastly, the seven genes spatio-temporal expression pattern was confirmed by real-time PCR. Our findings advocate that interleukin 20 receptor subunit alpha (IL20RA), interleukin 6 receptor (IL6R), interleukin 1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1), Wnt family member 3A (WNT3A), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3), bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7), and secreted-frizzled related protein 2 (SFRP2) might possibly play vital roles in skin and feather follicle development and growth processes.

The purpose of this work was to measure changes in oxygen pressure in the air cell and under the eggshell (P(A)O2) of pre-pipping goose eggs before and after drilling holes into the air cell. Drilling a 0.6 mm (diameter of 0.9 mm) hole into the air cell caused an increase in air cell P(A)O2 of about 10 Torr. The rate of increase attenuated as hole area increased and reached about 21 Torr when the drilled area was 8.5 mm2. The P(A)O2 of intact eggs was not equally distributed under the shell. It was high in the air cell area (108 Torr) and decreased towards the pointed end (86 Torr). The increase in P(A)O2 after drilling a 4.9 mm2 hole was high in the air cell (18 Torr) and decreased with distance, becoming non-significant at the pointed end. The significant increase in P(A)O2 after drilling was limited to a distance of up to 38 mm along the shell from the edge of the air cell. This indicates that lateral diffusion in the shell membranes under the shell is limited. Drilling a hole of 3.5 to 4.9 mm2 was enough to increase air cell P(A)O2 in most of the eggs above the critical value of 100 Torr for hatching success. The increase in P(A)O2 was limited to about half the area of the shell and the average increase in P(A)O2 was 6.3 Torr (equivalent to a 0.9% increase in ambient O2). However, the blood perfusing chorioallantoic areas further away from the air cell edge may not be fully saturated with O2 and may not be sufficient to compensate fully for the low O2 availability caused by low eggshell conductance.

1. Since the early 1990s, an increasing proportion of barnacle geese, Branta leucopsis, bound for breeding sites in the Russian Arctic delay their departure from the wintering quarters in the Wadden Sea by 4 weeks. These late-migrating geese skip spring stopover sites in the Baltic traditionally used by the entire population. 2. Individual geese from an arctic colony tracked by satellite or light-level geolocators during spring migration in 2004 and 2005 predominantly followed the new strategy, but a minority still maintained the traditional pattern. Despite a spread of more than 50 days in departure date from the Wadden Sea, both early and late departing females laid their eggs within the short time-window conferring breeding success. 3. The spread of these new migration routines coincided with a strong increase of overall numbers and the exploitation of new spring staging resources in the Wadden Sea. Counts from Estonia demonstrate that numbers have levelled off recently at the Baltic staging sites, suggesting that the capacity of these staging sites in spring has been reached. Although onset of spring affects migratory timing in barnacle geese, it cannot explain the observed delay in departure from the wintering grounds. 4. We hypothesize that the new migratory strategy has evolved in response to increased competition for food at spring staging sites in the Baltic. According to an analytical model of optimal migration, the geese should skip the Baltic whenever the energy deposition rate falls below 88% of the Wadden Sea value.

A short period of overfeeding can lead to severe hepatic steatosis in the goose, which is physiological, suggesting that geese, as a descendent of a migrating ancestor, may have evolutionally developed a unique mechanism that operates in contrast to the mechanism underlying pathological fatty liver in humans or other mammals. In this study, we report that suppression of miR29c and upregulation of its target genes in goose fatty liver vs. normal liver could be part of a unique mechanism that contributes to the regulation of energy homeostasis and cell growth.

The origins of the European domestic goose are uncertain. The available information comes from archaeological findings and historical literature, but genetic evidence has hitherto been scarce. The domestic goose in Europe is derived from the greylag goose (Anser anser), but it is not known where the initial domestication took place and which of the two subspecies of greylag goose was ancestral. We aimed to determine the amount and geographical distribution of genetic diversity in modern populations of greylag geese as well as in different breeds of the domestic goose to make inferences about goose domestication. We studied DNA sequence variation in the mitochondrial control region of greylag geese from multiple populations across Europe and western Asia as well as specimens of domestic geese representing 18 modern breeds and individuals not belonging to any recognised breed. Our results show notable differences in genetic diversity between different greylag goose populations and the presence of six mitochondrial haplogroups which show a degree of geographical partitioning. The genetic diversity of the domestic goose is low, with 84% of sampled individuals having one of two major closely related haplotypes, suggesting that modern European domestic geese may derive from a narrow genetic base. The site of domestication remains unresolved, but domestic geese in Turkey were unusually diverse, indicating the importance of further sampling in the vicinity of the eastern Mediterranean and the Near East. There appears to be past or ongoing hybridisation between greylags and domestic geese in particular areas, consistent with field observations.

Although it is well-known that retrograde transport of urine fills the caeca of birds with fluid and small particles, the function of avian caeca is still not fully understood. We measured mean retention times (MRT) of solute (cobalt-EDTA, Co), small particle (<2mm, chromium-mordanted fibre, Cr) and large particle (8mm, cerium-marked fibre, Ce) markers in geese (Anser anser) and turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) fed alfalfa pellets ad libitum. Intake did not differ between species. Turkeys had longer MRT for all markers (Co: 10.4 vs. 3.2h; Cr 23.3 vs. 2.9h; Ce 9.5 vs. 2.1h), achieved a higher fibre digestibility, and had a higher calculated dry matter gut fill. Thus, geese and turkeys correspond to the typical dichotomy of good fliers vs. poor fliers/flightless species in avian herbivores. Because uric acid is fermented much faster by microbes than fibre, the ultimate cause of short-MRT digesta retention in avian caeca as in geese is possibly rather uric acid than fibre fermentation. The numerical differences between marker MRT in geese correspond to a colonic separation mechanism that delays the excretion of fluids more than small and again more than large particles. In contrast to geese, turkeys excreted solid and liquid (caecal) faeces. Liquid faeces contained less fibre and more crude protein than solid faeces and accounted for the excretion of 7, 25 and 34% of Ce, Co and Cr markers. Marker excretion patterns and MRT for liquid faeces (Co 15 vs. Cr 50h) suggest that small particles did not simply move in parallel to fluids, but were retained selectively by being trapped in colonic digesta upon expulsion from caeca, with subsequent repeated retrograde transport into caeca with the next batch of urine. Given the absence of coprophagy in birds (in contrast to small mammalian herbivores), such a delay of small (microbial) particle escape from the caeca appears reasonable.

1. Perturbations to ecosystems have the potential to directly and indirectly affect species interactions, with subsequent impacts on population dynamics and the vital rates that regulate them. 2. The few long-term studies of common eider breeding ecology indicate that reproductive success is low in most years, interrupted by occasional boom years. However, no study has explicitly examined the drivers of long-term variation in reproductive success. 3. Here, we use encounter history data collected across 41 years to examine the effects of arctic foxes (a terrestrial nest predator), local abundance and spatial distribution of lesser snow geese (an alternative prey source), and spring climate on common eider nest success. 4. Eider nest success declined over the course of the study, but was also highly variable across years. Our results supported the hypothesis that the long-term decline in eider nest success was caused by apparent competition with lesser snow geese, mediated by shared predators. This effect persisted even following a large-scale exodus of nesting geese from the eider colony. Nest success was also lowest in years of low arctic fox index, presumably driven by prey switching in years of low small mammal availability. However, increased snow goose abundance appeared to buffer this effect through prey swamping. The effect of spring climate depended on the stage of the breeding season; cold and wet and warm and dry conditions in early spring were correlated with decreased nest success, whereas warm and wet conditions in late spring increased eider nest success. 5. These results underscore the significance of both trophic interactions and climate in regulating highly variable vital rates, which likely have important consequences for population dynamics and the conservation of long-lived iteroparous species.

The light and electron microscopic structure of the pineal complex of the domestic goose was studied. The complex is tubulofollicular but there is no direct connection between the constituent system of ducts and the third ventricle of the brain. Within the pineal, blood vessels accompanied by sympathetic nerve bundles are confined to the connective tissue. Other nerve fibers and occasional nerve cell bodies, however, do occur among the pineal cells. Threee basic pineal cell types were distinguished: (1) elongate epithelial cells which are arranged around follicles and ducts and resemble degenerate photoreceptor cells; (2) intramural supportive cells which are interspersed with elongate epithelial and intramural supportive cells; and (3) small supportive cells which lie between the bases of the elongate epithelial and intramural supportive cells. The follicular structure, vascularization, presence of secretory granules, and the nature of the elongate epithelial cells indicate that the pineal complex is primarily endocrine through a possible photoreceptive function cannot be ignored. Vesicles, 100-300 and 40-100 nm wide, were found with;n nerves and intramural supportive cells. The larger vesicles, present in pineals collected in the night, probably contain peptidic hormones. The smaller vesicles present in both day and night samples probably contain aminergic hormones.

Ten groups of one-year-old geese, each including 10 layers and 3 ganders, were treated with T-2 toxin at doses of 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg body weight/day for 18 days by injection into the stomach. At the toxin dose of 0.1 mg/kg/day, the egg yield remained unchanged while the hatching rate slightly decreased. T-2 toxin administered at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg/day decreased the hatching rate and the egg yield. The toxin dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day resulted in a 50% reduction of the hatching rate. The mortality rate was significant at toxin levels higher than 0.8 mg/bwkg/day; however, 30% of the birds survived even the 3.0 mg/kg/day toxin dose.

The parasitic relationship between a black fly, Simulium annulus, and the common loon (Gavia immer) has been considered one of the most exclusive relationships between any host species and a black fly species. To test the host specificity of this blood-feeding insect, we made a series of bird decoy presentations to black flies on loon-inhabited lakes in northern Wisconsin, U.S.A. To examine the importance of chemical and visual cues for black fly detection of and attraction to hosts, we made decoy presentations with and without chemical cues. Flies attracted to the decoys were collected, identified to species, and quantified. Results showed that S. annulus had a strong preference for common loon visual and chemical cues, although visual cues from Canada geese (Branta canadensis) and mallards (Anas platyrynchos) did attract some flies in significantly smaller numbers.

During evolution, the amino acid sequence of a protein is much more variable and changes more rapidly than its tertiary structure. Given sufficient time, the amino acid sequences of proteins derived from a common precursor may alter to the point that they are no longer demonstrably homologous. The ability to make meaningful comparisons between such distantly related proteins must therefore come primarily from structural homology, and only secondarily (if at all) from sequence homology. On the other hand, structural homology in the absence of sequence homology might be attributed to convergent rather than divergent evolution. (A common fold might be dictated by functional or folding requirements.) We have previously argued, on the basis of structural and functional similarities, that the lysozymes of hen egg-white and bacteriophage T4 have a common evolutionary precursor, even though their amino acid sequences have no detectable similarity. Here we report the structure of the lysozyme from Embden goose, a representative of a third class of lysozymes that has no sequence homology (or perhaps very weak homology) with either the hen egg-white or the phage enzyme. The structure of goose egg-white lysozyme has striking similarities to the lysozymes from hen egg-white and bacteriophage T4. However, some parts of goose lysozyme resemble hen lysozyme while other parts correspond only to the phage enzyme. The nature of the structural correspondence strongly suggests that all three lysozymes evolved from a common precursor.

1. Metabolic functions, fiber composition and, in some cases, mitochondrial morphology have been investigated in the pectoralis major and sartorius of the goose, quail, pheasant, guinea-hen, broiler chicken and laying hen. 2. In the pectoralis only two types of fibers, red and white twitch fibers, are found in all birds studied except in the quail, where a third twitch fiber also occurs. Red fibers form the main part in the quail and goose, white fibers in the rest. In the sartorius at least three types of fibers, two twitch and one tonus are found in all birds except in the guinea-hen where only two fibers can be found. 3. The metabolic pattern of the muscles, based on determination of specific activities of metabolic key enzymes, varies greatly among the birds. Three groups can be discerned from the ratio between aerobic and anaerobic activities or between fatty acid oxidation and carbohydrate metabolism. The metabolic patterns are reflected in the fiber combinations of the muscles. 4. The size and number of the mitochondria vary among different animals and different fiber types. The metabolism of red and white fibers is discussed.

The efficacy of flubendazole food medication against roundworms in geese was determined under controlled field conditions. The geese were infected with Amidostomum anseris, Capillaria anseris, Trichostrongylus tennis, and Syngamus trachea. Medicated food was given for 7 consecutive days at a level of 30 ppm. Anthelmintic activity, egg production, and hatchability were recorded. Flubendazole medication resulted in a 100% worm elimination, no consistent change in egg-lay performance, and a highly significant increase in hatchability.

Between the siblings of a family of greylag geese (Anser anser L.) a rank order is established by fighting during the first days after hatching, and also by other, more complex interactions. The position of each goose in the rank order can be defined by three groups of behaviour patterns (aggressive behaviour, "greetings", escape responses). A clear-cut ranking relation between two individuals is a prerequisite for their close cohesion. The survival function of rank order lies in diminishing the intensity and frequency of agonistic interactions, in diminishing social stress situations and in guaranteeing the close family cohesion.

1. This study was to investigate the development of the activities of pancreatic and caecal enzymes in White Roman goslings from hatching to 28 d of age. 2. A total of 80 1-d-old goslings were used. At hatching, 3 and 7 d of age, 16 goslings (8 males and 8 females) were used. At 11, 14, 21 and 28 d of age, 8 goslings, 4 males and 4 females were selected. The activities of amylase, lipase, trypsin and chymotrypsin in each segment of the small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, ileum) and their contents and the activity of cellulase in the caecal contents were measured. 3. The specific activity (SA) of amylase in the duodenal mucosa and contents increased significantly both from 11 to 14 and 14 to 21 d of age and declined after 28 d of age. In the jejunum and ileum, there was a significant peak in the SA of amylase in the mucosa in goslings from 7 to 21 d of age. On average, the SA of lipase of mucosa and content in the small intestine was initially low but gradually increased from 14 to 21 and from 21 to 28 d of age. 4. The SA of trypsin in the contents of the duodenum and the jejunum increased both from 7 to 11 and 11 to 14 d of age and there was high activity in the ileal contents from 14 to 21 d of age. From 3 to 14 d of age, the SA of chymotrypsin in the duodenal mucosa significantly increased and peaked. There was a significant peak at 11 d of age in the SA of chymotrypsin in the duodenal or jejunal contents and in the ileal contents at 7 d. The SA of cellulase in the caecal contents increased linearly with age, reaching a plateau at 28 d of age. 5. The rate of activity development varied from hatching to 28 d of age. However, the mean SA of amylase and lipase of intestinal contents reached a peak at 21 d, trypsin and chymotrypsin at 11 d and cellulase at 28 d of age, respectively. The quantitative changes in SA of cellulase, amylase, lipase, trypsin and chymotrypsin increased by about 4-, 3-, 5-, 2- and 3-fold, respectively, in the intestinal content of goslings. Thus, development of proteases in the intestine of goslings peaked more rapidly than amylase, lipase and cellulase during the first 4 weeks.

Commercial geese breeding in Poland is based on two strains of White Italian geese (W11 and W33). The crossbreeds W33 (paternal line) and W11 (maternal line) are distributed in Poland under the commercial brand of White Kołuda goose. However, there are several breeds which are covered by the animal genetic resources conservation program and kept as conservative flocks. These breeds proved invaluable to commercial geese breeding to stabilize body weight, improve muscling and decrease the amount of fat in the carcass of the crossbreeds. Therefore, this study analyzed the reciprocal crossbreeds of White Kołuda geese with the individuals from conservative flocks. DNA polymorphism (RAPD-PCR) of the crossbreeds as well as the phenotypic effect of crossbreeding was evaluated. PCR amplification of five RAPD markers resulted in obtaining 14.25 band/crossbreed group. The genetic similarity of the crossbreeds expressed as band sharing frequency (BS) ranged from 0.44 to 0.97. The direction of crossing of the W33 goose with one of the individuals from the conservative flock strongly affected the genetic similarity estimates. The body weight in the 17th or 24th week of life and the percentage of leg muscle weight in the 24th week of life differed significantly depending on the crossbreed genotype. A similar relationship was demonstrated for egg fertilization and number of nestlings per goose. As the lines were differentiated only by origin of the Z chromosome, the background of the differences in genetic polymorphism and the phenotypic records is hypothesized as (i) the linkage of some production traits with sex chromosomes; (ii) the impact of selection on W33 individuals resulting in lower performance of geese with a W33-derived Z chromosome; (iii) genetic imprinting displayed as the effect of either maternal or paternal origin of the Z chromosome.

In group-living vertebrates, reliable social allies play a decisive role in dealing with stressors. For example, support by social allies is known to dampen glucocorticoid responses. It remains unknown, however, how social embedding affects the sympatho-adrenergic axis as indicated by heart rate (HR) in non-human animals. We studied the relationships between HR, pair-bond status and distance from the pair-partner in twenty-five free-ranging greylag geese (Anser anser) in a natural social environment. In three individuals, we investigated HR responses following partner loss. Overall, we found a context- and sex-dependent difference in HR between paired and unpaired individuals, paired males having a lower HR during agonistic encounters, and unpaired females having a lower HR during resting. Also, in paired females HR increased with increasing distance from the partner. Our data suggest that HR is modulated by pair-bond status in greylag geese in a context- and sex-dependent manner, which may be representative for social vertebrates in general. Despite the low sample size, the present study indicates that proper social embedding may optimize an individual's physiological investment in the social domain. This reduces individual energy expenditure and may benefit health and reproductive success.

The objectives of this study were to compare the thermoregulatory, metabolic and ventilatory responses to hypoxia of the high altitude bar-headed goose with low altitude waterfowl. All birds were found to reduce body temperature (T(b)) during hypoxia, by up to 1-1.5 degrees C in severe hypoxia. During prolonged hypoxia, T(b) stabilized at a new lower temperature. A regulated increase in heat loss contributed to T(b) depression as reflected by increases in bill surface temperatures (up to 5 degrees C) during hypoxia. Bill warming required peripheral chemoreceptor inputs, since vagotomy abolished this response to hypoxia. T(b) depression could still occur without bill warming, however, because vagotomized birds reduced T(b) as much as intact birds. Compared to both greylag geese and pekin ducks, bar-headed geese required more severe hypoxia to initiate T(b) depression and heat loss from the bill. However, when T(b) depression or bill warming were expressed relative to arterial O(2) concentration (rather than inspired O(2)) all species were similar; this suggests that enhanced O(2) loading, rather than differences in thermoregulatory control centres, reduces T(b) depression during hypoxia in bar-headed geese. Correspondingly, bar-headed geese maintained higher rates of metabolism during severe hypoxia (7% inspired O(2)), but this was only partly due to differences in T(b). Time domains of the hypoxic ventilatory response also appeared to differ between bar-headed geese and low altitude species. Overall, our results suggest that birds can adjust peripheral heat dissipation to facilitate T(b) depression during hypoxia, and that bar-headed geese minimize T(b) and metabolic depression as a result of evolutionary adaptations that enhance O(2) transport.

By using the polymerase chain reaction to amplify and sequence 178 bp of a rapidly evolving region of the mtDNA genome (segment I of the control region) from 81 individuals, approximately 11% of the variation present in the lesser snow goose Chen caerulescens caerulescens L. mitochondrial genome was surveyed. The 26 types of mtDNA detected formed two distinct mitochondrial clades that differ by an average of 6.7% and are distributed across the species range. Restriction analysis of amplified fragments was then used to assign the mtDNA of an additional 29 individuals to either of these clades. Within one major clade, sequence among mtDNAs was concordant with geographic location. Within the other major clade the degree of sequence divergence among haplotypes was lower and no consistent geographic structuring was evident. The two major clades presumably result from vicariant separation of lesser snow geese during the Pleistocene.

An experiment with a 2 × 3 factorial design with two concentrations of dietary betaine (0 and 600 mg/kg) and three dietary concentrations of methionine (0, 600 and 1200 mg/kg) was conducted using goslings to estimate growth, nutrient utilisation and digestibility of amino acids from 21 to 70 d of age. Three hundred geese were randomised at 18 d of age into 6 groups with 5 replicates per treatment and 10 geese per replicate. Increasing dietary concentrations of methionine gave a linear increase in body weight and average daily gain. The coefficient of crude fat retention increased as dietary methionine increased and there was a significant non-linear response to increasing dietary methionine. Similarly, increasing supplemental methionine gave linear increases in the digestibility of methionine and cysteine. The results of this study indicated that optimal dietary supplementation of methionine could increase growth performance and methionine and cysteine utilisation in growing goslings. Betaine supplementation had no apparent sparing effect on methionine needs for growth performance, but did improve the apparent cysteine digestibility.

Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1) plays a crucial role in the synthesis of cholic acid and cholesterol catabolism. In this study, Cyp7a1 expression in goose liver was identified for the first time using differential display reverse transcription PCR. This study used real-time PCR and quantified the transcript levels of the cyp7a1 gene under different feeding conditions. In overfeeding, cyp7a1 expression by the liver was lower than that seen for normal feeding and the same result was observed for the Cyp7a1 protein level. The cholesterol level in serum and liver was higher in the overfed group. This study suggests that low-level expression of Cyp7a1 is associated with the formation of goose fatty liver.

Fecal lead (Pb) levels were investigated in the threatened European population of the Lesser White-fronted Goose (LWfG, Anser erythropus) and of the non-threatened Greater White-fronted Goose (GWfG, Anser albifrons) wintering in two wetland areas in northern Greece in order to assess the potential risk from Pb exposure. Fecal, soil and food plant samples were analyzed. Levels of Pb were normalized using Al concentrations in order to separate the effect of possible ingestion of Pb shot from that of soil or sediment accidentally ingested with food. All concentrations are expressed on a dry weight basis. Geometric means of Pb content in the feces of LWfG were 6.24 mg/kg at Evros Delta and 7.34 mg/kg at Lake Kerkini (maximum values of 28.61 mg/kg and 36.68 mg/kg, respectively); for fecal samples of GWfG geometric means were 2.39 mg/kg at Evros Delta and 6.90 mg/kg at Kerkini (corresponding maximum values of 25.09 mg/kg and 42.26 mg/kg). Soil Pb was in the range of 5.2-60.2mg/kg (geometric mean = 22.6 mg/kg) for the Evros Delta and between 13.4 and 64.9 mg/kg (geometric mean=28.1mg/kg) for Kerkini. A general linear model fitted to the data showed that Pb levels were very closely dependent on Al levels in the feces from both species and at both sites indicating soil or sediment were the only significant source of Pb; species and site, as well as their interaction, were not statistically significant factors. For both species and at both sites exposure to Pb was evidently very mild and the observed levels of Pb were well below the proposed thresholds for lethal or sublethal effects of Pb poisoning. Soil ingestion appeared to gradually increase from October to December for LWfG at Kerkini, corresponding to a gradual depletion of their food source.

1. It was found that anserine and carnosine form with o-phthalic aldehyde coloured reaction products of identical molar coefficient of absorption at 640 nm. Hence, a simple and rapid method for spectrophotometric determination of these dipeptides has been worked out. The method was applied to determine the sum of anserine and carnosine in muscles of adult geese, (female). Carnosine was determined with enzymatic method. 2. Ratio between anserine and carnosine concentrations depends on animal age (lower in 1-yr-old geese than in 2- and 3-yr-old ones) and type of muscles (lower in leg muscles compared to breast muscle). 3. Correlation was found between level of carnosine and level of anserine--it depended both on geese and type of muscles.

Experiments were conducted to compare management of ganders and semen collection procedures with respect to semen and sperm yield, and two frequencies of artificial insemination were tested with respect to fertility. Housing ganders in groups, singly, or singly with the introduction of a female just before collection was the rank order of housing system from least to most successful collection of ejaculates. There were no significant differences among types of housing with respect to semen volume, but ejaculates from ganders housed singly had the greatest (P less than .05) spermatozoal concentrations. Ejaculates collected with an artificial vagina were of greater (P less than .05) volume and total spermatozoal yield but not spermatozoal concentration than those collected by aspiration. Interactions between collector and method were observed for spermatozoal traits. Geese inseminated on 2 consecutive days/wk showed greater (P less than .01) fertility than those inseminated once per week. Therefore, collection of semen with an artificial vagina from ganders housed singly, with insemination weekly but on consecutive days, should result in successful reproduction of geese.

The Harderian gland (HG) in birds is the dominant orbital gland, which plays an important role in immunological response. Tissue sections taken from adult females of Bilgorajska goose were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, Azan, PAS, AB pH 2.5, AF and HDI. Based on the histological structure the HG in Bilgorajska geese had compound tubular structure with multiple lobules and two types of epithelial cells lining the tubules. Epithelial cells in the central part of the lobes were dark in color and contained serous fluid, while in the deeper layers, epithelial cells were lightly coloured and contained mucous fluid. Histochemical studies showed the presence of neutral mucopolysaccharides and carboxylated acid mucopolysaccharides in the secretory cells. The small number of single plasma cells were present in HDI staining below the basement membrane of the secondary and primary ducts, near the crypts of the main duct. TEM study demonstrated that plasma cells had a large nucleus with condensed heterochromatin and were rich in rough endoplasmic reticulum. The knowledge of gland's structure, and above all an analysis of the immune system components may affect clinical practice and properly conducted immunization of birds.

Type III interferons (IFN-λ1/λ2/λ3, also known as IL-29/28A/28B, and IFN-λ4) are a recently discovered interferon group. In this study, we first identified the Chinese goose IFN-λ (goIFN-λ). The full-length sequence of goIFN-λ was found to be 823 bp. There was only one open reading frame that contained 570 bp, and, encoded 189 amino acids. The predicted goIFN-λ protein showed 78%, 67%, and 40% amino acid identity with duIFN-λ, chIFN-λ, and hIFN-λ3, respectively. The tissue distribution of goIFN-λ existed as a parallel distribution with goIFNLR1 as its functional receptor, which was mainly expressed in epithelium-rich tissues, such as lung, gizzard, proventriculus, skin and pancreas, and immune tissues, such as harderian gland and thymus. Furthermore, the immunological characteristics studies of goIFN-λ showed that there was a significant increase in the mRNA at the transcriptional level of goIFN-λ after the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with ploy (I:C) and ODN2006, and infected with Gosling plague virus (GPV). In vivo, the mRNA transcriptional level of goIFN-λ increased nearly 20 times in the lung tissue and nearly 40 times in the pancreatic tissue after being artificially infected with H9N2 AIV. It is suggested that goIFN-λ might play a pivotal role in the mucosal immune protection and antiviral defense.

The paper summarises seven years experiments designed to determine the effect of continuous insemination with frozen-thawed semen on fresh semen quality and sperm susceptibility to freezing stress in succeeding generations. During course of experiments, semen was collected from 10-12 White Koluda ganders at the age of 8-9 months, then subjected to freezing and used after thawing for insemination of 10 geese in order to obtain the subsequent generation of males. Semen was diluted 1 to 0.5 (v/v) with EK diluent, equilibrated for 15 min at +4 degrees C, mixed with 6 percent (v/v) of dimethyl-formamide (DMF), frozen to temp. -140 degrees C at a rate 60 degree C per min and then transferred into liquid nitrogen container. Semen samples were thawed prior to insemination in a 60 degree C water-bath. It is difficult to conclude whether freezing stress affected the fresh semen quality, since average volume of SQF (index comprising ejaculate volume, sperm concentration and percentage of live normal cells) varied between generations from 19.3 to 56.2. Continuous goose reproduction by insemination with frozen-thawed semen resulted in significant increase (P less than 0.01) in spermatozoa resistance to cryoinjury in every subsequent generation. In the relation to adequate fresh semen the percentage of live morphologically intact spermatozoa which withstood freezing procedure increased from 27.2 in first generation to 74.4 in sixth generation.

Under similar environmental conditions, 100 male Shaver-Starbro hybrid chickens, 100 male Mulard cross-line ducklings and 100 male Landaise goslings kept in 30 metabolic cages from the first day of life (10 birds of each species separately per cage) were chosen for the study. The animals were fed semi ad libitum diets with crude protein content and energy density similar to that used for poultry species, avoiding feed residues. During the first 21 days of life they received starter diets and from day 22 to 42 grower diets. Maize accounted for 23-40% and barley constituted 10-18%. Wheat accounted for 20.0% in starter diets and 10-18% in grower diets. Resorption of yolk sac residues, performance, development of the intestinal tract in young chickens, ducklings and goslings were assessed. During the first 5 days of life intensive absorption of yolk sac ingredients was observed. On day 7, residues of the yolk sac were found in more than 30% of chickens compared with approximately 10% in geese. In ducklings residues of the yolk sac were not found. On day 16 unabsorbed yolk sacs were found in approximately 10% of chickens. Liver and pancreas weighed the highest in geese and in ducks; in chickens the weight of these organs was significantly lower (p < 0.01). The relative values calculated to 100 g of metabolic body weight show that the average small intestine in chickens was significantly longer (p < 0.01) than in ducks or geese. The intestinal tract developed earlier in the chicken than in the water fowl.

Waterfowl from Lake Wanaka and the Waitaki Lakes watershed of New Zealand's South Island were surveyed to find natural hosts with adult echinostomes and schistosomes to provide sufficient numbers of eggs for laboratory studies. The Canada goose (Branta canadensis) was found to host an echinostome determined to be a New Zealand strain of Echinostoma revolutum. The New Zealand scaup (Aythya novaeseelandia) concurrently hosts three species of echinostomes (E. revolutum, Echinoparyphium cinctum and E. recurvatum) plus two species of avian schistosomes (Trichobilharzia sp. and Dendritobilharzia pulverulenta). In the Canada goose and the New Zealand scaup, adult gravid echinostomes predominated over juveniles. In other waterfowl surveyed, very few echinostomes were found, with juveniles predominating.

Adequate short-term responses to stressors are of great importance for the health and well-being of individuals and factors modulating the physiological stress response (e.g., controllability, suddenness, familiarity) of a stimulus are well described under laboratory conditions. In the present study we aimed at investigating the stress response in greylag geese (Anser anser) in the field, confronting individuals with naturally occurring stressors. We measured beat-to-beat heart rate (HR) via fully implanted transmitters during three different experimental challenges: (1) catching and holding, (2) confrontation with a model predator, and (3) approach by different humans. We compared this to a control period and HR during agonistic encounters, a naturally occurring stressor. All three experimental situations evoked a HR increase. Highest HR responses were elicited by catching and holding the animals. In the third experiment, HR responses were greatest when the geese were approached by a human stranger (i.e., somebody the geese have never seen before). Hence, geese discriminated between different kinds of stressors and adjusted their physiological response depending on the type of stressor. Our results show that geese were able to discriminate between individual humans. In line with a number of lab studies, we suggest that particularly the controllability of certain situation determines the intensity of the HR response, also in a natural setting in the field.

To investigate the possible role of recombination in the evolution of Muscovy duck parvovirus (MDPV) and goose parvovirus (GPV) in Taiwan, we analyzed a potentially significant recombination event that occurred only in GPV by comparing thirteen complete sequences of the capsid gene VP2 of GPV and MDPV. The recombination event occurred between GPV strain 06-0239 as the minor parent and strains 99-0808 as the major parent, which resulted in the GPV recombinant V325/TW03. GPV V325/TW03 is likely to represent a new genotype among the Taiwanese GPV strains. This represents the first evidence that intergenotype recombination within the VP2 gene cluster contributes to the genetic diversity of the VP2 genes of Taiwanese GPV field strains.

Plasma levels of testosterone (T), 17-β-estradiol (E2), progesterone (P4), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), corticosterone (B), thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) were monitored during postnuptial and the prenuptial molt in domestic goose (Anser anser domesticus) in both sexes. 1. At the beginning of postnuptial molt (when the old, worn dawny-, and cover feathers' loss starts) in ganders, the levels of T, E2, P4 decrease while DHEA and B significantly increase. The elevated levels of T4 and low T3 concentrations characteristic of the last phase of the reproduction, remain unchanged. In layers, similar changes were observed, however, B decreases. 2. In the early phase of outgrowth of wing and cover feathers, plasma levels of T, E2 and P4 are low. Elevated B, DHEA and T4 concentrations decrease in ganders, while in layers DHEA increases and B and T4 levels remain unchanged. T3 increases in both sexes. 3. The subsequent intensive outgrowth period of wing- and cover feathers both in ganders and in layers is characterized by very low levels of T, E2, DHEA and T4, but P4 increased, and T3 concentration remain high. 4. At the end of postnuptial molt - when the outgrowth of dawny, cover-, and wing feathers stops - very low T, E2, P4, DHEA and T4 levels and and high T3 plasma levels were found in both sexes. Fast increase of plasma B was detected in ganders, while in geese, B concentration remain high. 5. During prenuptial molting (outgrowth of contour and tail feathers) low E2, P4 and T4, increasing T and DHEA, but very high T3 and B plasma concentration were measured in ganders. In layers, very low T, E2, P4, DHEA and T4 levels, and very high B and T3 levels were found. 6. At the beginning of the fall-winter sexual repose (postmolting stage) T, E2, P4, DHEA and T4 levels increase, T3 and B declines in both sexes. 7. In the subsequent phase of fall-winter period (preparatory stage) there is a further increase in T, P4 and T4, a fast increase of B and a decrease of E2, DHEA and T3 in ganders. In layers, T, P4 and DHEA decrease, B increases and the T4 and T3 do not change. 8. At the beginning of reproduction high T level, unchanged DHEA, slightly declined P4, and decreased E2, T4, T3 and a strong decline of B concentrations occur in ganders. In layers, T is further increased, E2 and P4 shows high levels, and, at the same time DHEA and T3 remain unchanged, while B and T4 decrease.

1. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the yield and tissue composition of carcases from White Kołuda ganders (males) and geese (females), and to determine the relationships between body measurements and carcase tissue composition. 2. The experiment was carried out on 200 geese (100 males and 100 females) reared to 14 weeks of age and then fed with oats for the next 3 weeks. Live body weight and body dimensions, slaughter yield, weight and percentage of muscles and skin with fat in carcase were measured and correlation coefficients were calculated between body measurements and slaughter values and carcase tissue composition. 3. White Kołuda geese reared to 17 weeks of age were characterised by high body weight (6705 g) and good muscle yield (29.9%). Males had greater body weight, musculature and fatness than females. Sternum length and breast circumference, width and depth were good indicators of carcase muscle weight in 17-week-old geese. 4. Negative coefficients of correlation between sternum length and weight of skin with subcutaneous fat indicate that increased selection pressure in pedigree flocks of geese on sternum length should be paralleled by reduced carcase fatness in these birds.

Studies were carried out to follow up the histologic changes taking place in the liver of Benkovska breed geese during different periods of fattening. A correlation was established between the period of fattening and the severity of the liver lesions. During the preparatory period there was in the hepatocytes focal fatty infiltration, and by the 5th-10th day of the forced fattening diffuse fatty infiltration and fatty and granular degeneration were seen. On the 15th-20th day of the fattening period predominating in the dystrophic hepatocytes were the medium-sized fatty vacuoles, and on the 28th day - the larger vacuoles, which corresponds to Ist quality in terms of weight and macroscopic picture. The enrichment of the liver with fats was accompanied by lymphocytic and pseudoeosinophilic leukocyte infiltration of the interstitium.

Brachyspira is associated with diarrhea and colitis in pigs, and control of these pathogens is complicated by their complex ecology. Identification of wildlife reservoirs of Brachyspira requires the discrimination of colonized animals and those simply contaminated through environmental exposure. Lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) were sampled in the Canadian arctic during the summer of 2011, and cloacal swabs were cultured on selective media. Brachyspira isolates were obtained from 15/170 (8.8 %) samples, and 12/15 isolates were similar to isolates previously recovered from pigs, including "Brachyspira hampsonii", a recently characterized species associated with dysentery-like disease in pigs in North America. A pilot inoculation study with one strongly β-hemolytic B. hampsonii isolate resulted in fecal shedding of the isolate by inoculated pigs for up to 14 days post-inoculation, but no severe clinical disease. Results of this study indicate that lesser snow geese can be colonized by Brachyspira strains that can also colonize pigs. Millions of lesser snow geese (C. caerulescens caerulescens) travel through the major pork-producing areas of Canada and the USA during their annual migration, making them a potential factor in the continental distribution of these bacteria.

The isolation of lysozyme from the egg white of several representative species of waterfowl is described. The purified lysozymes were analyzed in order to determine the type and molecular weight of each enzyme. All enzymes found in duck egg whites were found to be of the c-type. In contrast all true geese, the Mute Swan as well as the Northern Blackneck Screamer contain lysozyme g in their egg white.

Swan pipes, duck decoys, cage traps, cannon netting, and roundups are widely used to capture waterfowl in order to monitor populations. These methods are often regulated in countries with national ringing or banding programs and are considered to be safe, and thus justifiable given the benefits to conservation. However, few published studies have addressed how frequently injuries and mortalities occur, or the nature of any injuries. In the present study, rates of mortality and injury during captures with the use of these methods carried out by the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust as part of conservation programs were assessed. The total rate of injury (including mild dermal abrasions) was 0.42% across all species groups, whereas total mortality was 0.1% across all capture methods. Incidence of injury varied among species groups (ducks, geese, swans, and rails), with some, for example, dabbling ducks, at greater risk than others. We also describe techniques used before, during, and after a capture to reduce stress and injury in captured waterfowl. Projects using these or other capture methods should monitor and publish their performance to allow sharing of experience and to reduce risks further.

A case report of lead poisoning in Canada geese at Cheyenne Bottom Wildlife Management Area in Kansas is presented. Seventy-nine dead geese and 10 geese too weak too fly were found by management personnel. Clinical signs in the live geese were weakness, lethargy, anorexia, emaciation and bile stained diarrhea. Seventeen geese were necropsied. Lesions were impacted roots and fibrous stalks in the esophagus and proventriculus and numerous lead shot in the gizzard. One to 44 lead shot (mean 13) were found in the 17 gizzards examined. The concentration of lead in liver and kidney was 9.21 to 102.56 ug/g (wet weight). The presence of lead shot in the gizzard, characteristic clinical signs, and the concentration of lead in the liver and kidney confirmed the diagnosis of lead poisoning.

The chemical nature of Sindbis virus receptors on goose erythrocytes was investigated by means of two different experimental approaches: by testing the capacity of human serum lipoproteins (HDL, LDL, VLDL) to compete with erythrocytes for virus binding and by enzymatic and chemical modifications of the cell membrane. Each class of lipoproteins was separated into its protein and lipid components which were tested for hemagglutination and hemolysis inhibiting activity. Only the lipid moieties were able to inhibit binding and fusion activities of the virus. Enzymatic treatments of the erythrocyte surface showed that sialic acid and trypsin-sensitive proteins were not involved in Sindbis virus membrane receptor and that some phospholipids probably represent important components of the cellular binding site.

The profound and pervasive differences in gene expression observed between males and females, and the unique evolutionary properties of these genes in many species, have led to the widespread assumption that they are the product of sexual selection and sexual conflict. However, we still lack a clear understanding of the connection between sexual selection and transcriptional dimorphism, often termed sex-biased gene expression. Moreover, the relative contribution of sexual selection vs. drift in shaping broad patterns of expression, divergence, and polymorphism remains unknown. To assess the role of sexual selection in shaping these patterns, we assembled transcriptomes from an avian clade representing the full range of sexual dimorphism and sexual selection. We use these species to test the links between sexual selection and sex-biased gene expression evolution in a comparative framework. Through ancestral reconstruction of sex bias, we demonstrate a rapid turnover of sex bias across this clade driven by sexual selection and show it to be primarily the result of expression changes in males. We use phylogenetically controlled comparative methods to demonstrate that phenotypic measures of sexual selection predict the proportion of male-biased but not female-biased gene expression. Although male-biased genes show elevated rates of coding sequence evolution, consistent with previous reports in a range of taxa, there is no association between sexual selection and rates of coding sequence evolution, suggesting that expression changes may be more important than coding sequence in sexual selection. Taken together, our results highlight the power of sexual selection to act on gene expression differences and shape genome evolution.

The hemoglobin A of the Blue-and-Yellow Macaw (Ara ararauna) was isolated and characterized. The complete amino-acid sequence of alpha A- and beta-chains is presented. In contrast to some adult avian hemoglobins already investigated, Blue-and-Yellow Macaw hemoglobin is homogenous and contains only one component: HbA. The minor component, HbD, which is usually present in the hemolysate of avian erythrocytes, could not be detected. There is no evidence for the expression of the alpha D-globin gene. Comparison of alpha A- and beta-chains from Blue-and-Yellow Macaw hemoglobin with corresponding chains from Greylag Goose hemoglobin shows 19 amino-acid exchanges between alpha A-chains and 6 between beta-chains. The structure-function relationships of hemoglobin chains and the evolutionary aspects are discussed in view of these results.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of photoperiods longer than 14 h of light:10 h of dark (14L:10D) during the rearing period on the age at first egg laying (AFE) and the subsequent reproductive performance in geese. Sixty-six White Roman geese (18 male and 48 female) were divided into three groups and subjected to different lighting schemes, i.e. natural lighting (NAT; 23 degrees 51'N, 120 degrees 33'E), 14L and 18L. Birds in 14L and 18L groups were exposed to 14L:10D or 18L:6D, respectively, beginning at 19 weeks of age and followed by a photoperiod of 10L:14D from 40 weeks of age. The natural photoperiod, including both dawn and dusk was between 11.5L:12.5D and 14.5L:9.5D. The results showed that the AFE was postponed (P < 0.05). Average weight of the first three eggs laid and the fertility of these eggs were improved (P < 0.05) for the geese in 14L and 18L groups when compared to those raised under natural lighting conditions. Meanwhile, the duration of laying were shifted from spring to autumn, with the peak laying rate in September and November instead of March. It was concluded that geese exposed to the photoperiod longer than 14L:10D for 21 weeks during the rearing period would suppress their AFE. Thereafter, the onset of laying could be induced by being transferred to the photoperiod of 10L:14D. The manipulation of photoperiodic regimes used in this study might have a potential benefit for geese farmers through improved weight and fertility of eggs.

Adrenergic control of cardiovascular function is a common component of regulation in embryonic birds studied to date. Our goal was to investigate adrenergic and cholinergic cardiovascular regulation in two goose species, the Canada goose (Branta canadensis) and the related domestic goose (Anser anser domesticus) to determine if these species possess similar regulation during embryonic development. We determined mean arterial pressure (Pm) and heart rate (fH) responses to serial blockade of cholinergic, β-adrenergic and α-adrenergic receptors in B. canadensis and A. domesticus at 70 and 90% of total incubation (28days). Both species possessed cholinergic and β-adrenergic tone on fH at 70% of incubation that increased in intensity with development. In addition, a constant α-adrenergic tone on Pm was present in both species. Our findings indicate that these geese species possess both cholinergic and adrenergic cardiovascular regulation providing information needed for speculation regarding the commonalities in the ontogeny of these cardiovascular regulatory elements in birds.

We have studied the pancreatic hormone-glucose feed-back mechanisms by infusing glucagon (G), insulin (I) and glucose into normal fasting geese. The controls received saline. Whilst a NaCl 9% infusion is devoid of effect, the pancreatic hormones, used at physiological doses, modify the plasma glucose level, glucagon being hyperglycaemic and insulin hypoglycaemic. In addition, a physiological increase in plasma glucose provokes a drop in plasma glucagon and a rise in plasma insulin, thus a marked decrease in the G/I ratio. The results show that the pancreatic hormone-glucose feed-back mechanisms are effective under physiological conditions.

The dietary requirements for protein and amino acids of the growing gosling (0-7 weeks) were calculated according to body composition, maintenance needs and the absorption rate of amino acids from feeds. The diets were formulated by least-cost linear programming, using the calculated requirements for amino acids, with or without minimal glycine + serine requirements. The diets formulated without minimal requirements of glycine + serine were supplemented with various amounts of glycine, and fed to growing goslings. The calculated requirements for protein and essential amino acids were lower than those suggested for growing broilers and turkeys. The requirements (g/MJ metabolizable energy) at 0-2, 2-4 and 4-7 weeks of age respectively, were: lysine 0.88, 0.48, 0.43; methionine + cystine 0.48, 0.38, 0.29; protein 14.5, 9.3, 7.6. The goslings did not respond to glycine supplementation of the diet.

The relationships between plasma glucose, insulin and glucagon were studied in geese made diabetic by subtotal pancreatectomy. As early as the first hours after the operation, the plasma glucose increases and a permanent diabetes develops. This diabetic state is characterized by two features: a very low plasma insulin level, which does not vary during the survival of the diabetic animals and a concentration of plasma glucagon (of pancreatic origin) which transiently diminishes then rises far above the normal level, and is correlated with the basal concentration of plasma glucose. The impaired glucose tolerance observed in diabetic animals is related to the suppression of the glucose-insulin and glucose-glucagon feedback mechanisms.

Defects in the structure of the middle piece of poultry spermatozoon were studied by the electron-microscopic method. The defects included loose jointing of the head and falgellum owing to the shallow invagination fossa of the nucleus, and structural and mainly shape alterations of the proximal centriole. These defects existed in spermatozoa with a normal shape of nucleus as well as in those with rounded or otherwise irregularly shaped nuclei.

The goose parvovirus strain B was found to replicate only in cells with DNA synthesis. Cells in the stationary phase of DNA synthesis or maintained under 2 mM thymidine (TdR) in excess were refractive to the parvovirus infection. However, stationary phase cells could be rendered to produce progeny paroviruses by herpesvirus superinfection. In reverse, the replication of the herpesvirus was significantly inhibited by parvovirus preinfection of cells.

Extracts of the feces of 3 carnivorous animals (dog, river otter and sea gull) and 5 herbivorous animals (cow, horse, sheep, chicken and goose) induced chromosome aberrations (breaks and exchanges) in cultured CHO cells. The addition of CuII (10(-4)M) enhanced the clastogenic effect of fecal extracts of the examined animals with the exceptiion of 1 dog and 3 cow samples. Catalase reduced the chromosome-breaking and mitosis-inhibiting capacities of fecal extracts. These results indicate the presence of hydrogen peroxide-forming compounds. The possibility must be considered that animal and human excreta may be a major source of mutagens entering man's environment.

Normal structure of the accessory organs of the eye is essential for normal eye physiology. Among the most important accessory organs of the eye are the eyelids, the conjunctiva-associated lymphoid tissue (CALT) and the lacrimal gland (LG). The aim of this study was to demonstrate the histological structure of the eyelids and LG by histochemical and ultrastructural analysis. The study was performed on 13 adult female Bilgorajska geese. Eyelid samples were stained with the Alcian blue (AB pH 2.5) and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) methods. Staining methods used for LG were AB pH 2.5, aldehyde fuchsin (AF), PAS and Hale's dialysed iron (HDI). Within the connective tissue of the eyelids, well-developed, diffuse, CALT follicles were observed, mostly under the conjunctival epithelium. Numerous lymphocytes were present within loose connective tissue. Staining of the eyelids with the PAS method demonstrated the presence of goblet cells of a mucous nature, and AB pH 2.5 staining indicated the presence of sulfated acid mucopolysaccharides. PAS staining of LG revealed the presence of secretory cells containing weakly PAS-positive granules. All epithelial cells of the corpus glandulae and the duct systems reacted positively to AB pH 2.5. HDI staining detected the presence of carboxylated acid mucopolysaccharides. Transmission electron microscopy investigations revealed two types of secretory epithelial cells in LG. Both types of LG cells contained drop-like secretory vesicles of different sizes with low or high electron density in cytoplasm, as well as small and large lipid vacuoles, and numerous small primary lysosomes.

In this study, we report the establishment and characterization of a new epithelial cell line, goose embryonated epithelial cell line (GEE), derived from embryonic goose tissue. The purified GEE cell line can efficiently grow over 65 passages in the M199 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C. Immunofluorescence assay was used to identify purified GEE cells as epithelial cell line by detecting expression of the Keratin-18 and -19. Further characterizations demonstrated that the GEE cell line can be continuously subcultured with (i) a high capacity to replicate for over 65 passages, (ii) a spontaneous epithelial-like morphology, (iii) constant chromosomal features and (iv) without an evidence of converting to tumorigenic cells either in vitro or in vivo study. Moreover, the GEE cell line can be effectively transfected with plasmids expressing reporter genes of different avian viruses, such as VP3, VP1 and F of goose parvo virus (GPV), duck hepatitis virus (DHV), and Newcastle disease virus (NDV), respectively. Finally, the established GEE cell line was evaluated for avian viruses infection susceptibility. Our results showed that the tested GPV, DHAV and NDV were capable to replicate in the new cell line with titers a comparatively higher to the ones detected in the traditional culture system. Accordingly, our established GEE cell line is apparently a suitable in vitro model for transgenic, and infection manipulation studies.

Flyability is the most discrepant trait between modern-day geese and their wild ancestors, and the degeneration of flyability is a key marker of the successful domestication of wild geese. In light of the relatively short history of domestic geese, intense artificial selection is thought to play an important role in the degeneration of flyability. However, the underlying mechanism behind this phenomenon has seldom been investigated. In this study, we applied a molecular evolutionary approach to the evaluation of partial breeds of domestic geese in order to look for genes involved in the selection pressure toward degeneration of flyability. The haplotype networks, pairwise fixation index (FST) values, and analysis of molecular variance results all clearly illustrated a population variance between Landes geese and partial Chinese domestic geese. We also detected signatures of positive artificial selection in the COX2 and COX3 genes, and related selection in the HBB gene. Our results support the independent origins of partial European domestic geese and Chinese domestic geese. In addition, both positive artificial selection and the relaxation of functional constraints appeared to play important roles in the degeneration of flyability in domestic geese.

Radioactively-labelled VSV, both Indiana and New Jersey serotypes, were rapidly and efficiently adsorbed onto goose erythrocytes, but only within a narrow range of pH and at low temperatures. Under optimal conditions for adsorption, both infectivity and haemagglutinating activity of VSV were reduced. A basic difference between the two serotypes was identified: adsorption and haemagglutination of the Indiana serotype were stable even at pH 9.0 and at 37 degrees C, whereas New Jersey serotype was eluted slowly at +0 degrees C and at pH 6.4 and rapidly at a higher temperature and pH. The rapid elution offers a useful method for purification of New Jersey serotype. Particle counting of VSV showed that 10 to 50 virus particles were required for one PFU. Haemagglutination was not a sensitive method for assaying small amounts of VSV; 3--20X10(7) virus particles or more than 10(7) PFU corresponded to one HAU.

The ability of an exotic species to establish in a system may depend not only on the invasibility of the native community, but also on its interactions with other exotic species. Though examples of mutually beneficial interactions between exotic species are known, few studies have quantified these effects or identified specific mechanisms. We used the co-invasion of an endangered island ecosystem by exotic Canada geese (Branta canadensis) and nine exotic annual grasses to study the effects of an invading herbivore on the success of invading grasses. On our study islands in southwestern Canada, we found that geese fed selectively on the exotic grasses and avoided native forbs. Counter to current theory suggesting that the grasses should be limited by a selective enemy, however, the grasses increased in proportional abundance under grazing whereas forbs showed declining abundance. Testing potential mechanisms for the effects of grazing on grasses, we found that the grasses produced more stems per area when grazing reduced vegetation height and prevented litter accumulation. Forming dense mats of short stems appeared to be an efficient reproductive and competitive strategy that the Eurasian grasses have evolved in the presence of grazers, conferring a competitive advantage in a system where the native species pool has very few annual grasses and no grazers. Germination trials further demonstrated that selective herbivory by geese enables their dispersal of exotic grass seed between heavily invaded feeding areas and the small islands used for nesting. In summary, the exotic geese facilitated both the local increase and the spatial spread of exotic grasses, which in turn provided the majority of their diet. This unexpected case of positive feedback between exotic species suggests that invasion success may depend on the overall differences between the evolutionary histories of the invaders and the evolutionary history of the native community they enter.

The prevalence and distribution of Cryptosporidium spp. in the fecal droppings of the free-living waterfowl Canada geese were examined at 13 sites in Ohio and Illinois. On the basis of the analysis of the small-subunit rRNA gene by PCR, followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing, 49 (23.4%) of 209 fecal specimens collected from 10 sites (76.9%) were positive for Cryptosporidium spp. The following five Cryptosporidium species and genotypes were identified: Cryptosporidium goose genotype I (in 36 specimens), Cryptosporidium goose genotype II (in 9 specimens), Cryptosporidium duck genotype (in 1 specimen), Cryptosporidium parvum (in 4 specimens), and C. hominis (in 2 specimens). Cryptosporidium goose genotype I was the most prevalent parasite and was found at all five Cryptosporidium-positive sites in Ohio and at four of five positive sites in Illinois, followed by Cryptosporidium goose genotype II, which was found at two of five positive sites in Ohio and at four of five positive sites in Illinois. Cryptosporidium goose genotype II was detected for the first time, and it is phylogenetically related to goose genotype I and the duck genotype. All three genotypes have not so far been reported in humans, and their pathogenicity in geese has not been determined. Only 10.2% of the Cryptosporidium-positive specimens had C. parvum and C. hominis. The results of this study indicate that Canada geese might only serve as accidental carriers of cryptosporidia infectious to humans and probably play a minor role in the animal-to-human transmission cycle of the pathogen.

The karyotypes of three avian species--Meleagris gallopavo, Anser anser L., and Columba livia domestica--were investigated by means of counterstain-enhanced fluorescence techniques (chromomycin A3/distamycin A/DAPI followed by DAPI/actinomycin D staining). A heterochromatin characterization of macro- and microchromosomes was performed. CMA3-positive (GC-rich) regions in the turkey included the telomeres of chromosomes 1, 3, 4, and Z. In the goose, the chromosome 2 was also CMA3-bright at the telomeres. The W chromosome possessed large amounts of CMA3-bright material on the short arm in both the turkey and the goose. Two types of centromeric heterochromatin were distinguished on acro- to telocentric chromosomes 6 to 14 in the pigeon. The microchromosomal heterochromation of the turkey and goose was GC-rich but had a high degree of variation. In the pigeon, several microchromosomes possessed predominantly AT-rich heterochromatin.

The analysis of plasma biochemistry and haematology to monitor the condition of birds in the wild has been found a useful tool in ecological research. Despite biparental investment in most wild birds studied, some studies of condition indices found sex differences, and attributed these to the costs of egg formation or brooding in females or a higher contribution of males to chick rearing. We studied the natural variation of haematological and plasma biochemistry parameters (namely leucocyte, lymphocyte and heterophil counts, H/L ratio and plasma concentrations of proteins, triglycerides and carotenoids) in relation to the different measures of parental investment in males and females in the Upland goose (Chloephaga picta leucoptera), a socially monogamous species. We found no sex differences in haematological and most plasma biochemistry parameters, but a relation to different aspects of parental investment in breeding male and female Upland geese. H/L ratios were related to body condition and capture date in males while leucocyte counts, plasma protein and plasma carotenoid concentrations varied with clutch measures and hatching date in females. Higher H/L ratios of males in a low body condition and later in the year may reflect stress associated with the investment into the establishment and defence of the breeding territory. Females with higher clutch volumes had lower total leucocyte and lymphocyte numbers and higher levels of plasma protein. Earlier hatching dates were associated with lower numbers of all leucocyte types and higher values of plasma carotenoid concentrations. This indicates that differences in health state are reflected in reproductive performance in female Upland geese. We also found sexual differences in the repeatability of haematological and plasma biochemistry parameters between years and therefore suggest that their potential as a measure of individual quality differs between male and female Upland geese. Finally, numbers of leucocyte counts and plasma triglyceride concentrations of pair partners were significantly related. No study so far investigated these parameters in pair partners and we discuss possible reasons for our finding.

In order to compare the pathogenicity of different Tembusu virus (TMUV) strains from geese, ducks and chickens, 56 5-day-old Cherry Valley ducklings which were divided into 7 groups and infected intramuscularly with 7´105 PFU/ml per duck of six challenge virus stocks. The clinical signs, weight gain, mortality, macroscopic and microscopic lesions, virus loads in sera of 1, 3, 5, 7, 11 and 14 dpi and serum antibody titers were examined. The results showed that these viruses could make the young ducks sick, but the clinical signs differed with the different species-original strains. All the experimental groups lose markedly in weight gain compared to the control, but there were no obvious distinctions in weight gains, as well as macroscopic and microscopic lesions of dead ducks between the infected groups. However, the groups of waterfowl-derived strains (from geese and ducks) showed more serious clinical signs and higher relative expressions of virus loads in sera than those from chicken-derived. The mortality of waterfowl groups was 37.5%, and the greatest mortality of chicken groups was 12.5%. The serum antibodies of the geese-species group JS804 appeared earlier and were higher in the titers than others. Taken toghter, the pathogenicity of waterfowl-derived TMUV was more serious than chicken-derived TMUV and JS804 could be chosen as one TMUV vaccine strain to protect from the infection.

Virulent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) since 2005 have raised the question about the roles of migratory and wild birds in the transmission of HPAI. Despite increased monitoring, the role of wild waterfowl as the primary source of the highly pathogenic H5N1 has not been clearly established. The impact of outbreaks of HPAI among species of wild birds which are already endangered can nevertheless have devastating consequences for the local and non-local ecology where migratory species are established. Understanding the entangled dynamics of migration and the disease dynamics will be key to prevention and control measures for humans, migratory birds and poultry. Here, we present a spatial dynamic model of seasonal migration derived from first principles and linking the local dynamics during migratory stopovers to the larger scale migratory routes. We discuss the effect of repeated epizootic at specific migratory stopovers for bar-headed geese (Anser indicus). We find that repeated deadly outbreaks of H5N1 on stopovers during the autumn migration of bar-headed geese could lead to a larger reduction in the size of the equilibrium bird population compared with that obtained after repeated outbreaks during the spring migration. However, the opposite is true during the first few years of transition to such an equilibrium. The age-maturation process of juvenile birds which are more susceptible to H5N1 reinforces this result.

Agouti signalling protein (ASIP) is an endogenous antagonist of melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) and is involved in the regulation of pigmentation in mammals. The objective of this study was to identify and characterise the ASIP gene in domestic goose. The goose ASIP cDNA consisted of a 44-nucleotide 5'-terminal untranslated region (UTR), a 390-nucleotide open-reading frame (ORF) and a 45-nucleotide 3'-UTR. The length of goose ASIP genomic DNA was 6176 bp, including three coding exons and two introns. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that the ORF encodes a protein of 130 amino-acid residues with a molecular weight of 14.88 kDa and an isoelectric point of 9.73. Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis showed that the amino-acid sequence of ASIP was conserved in vertebrates, especially in the avian species. RT-qPCR showed that the goose ASIP mRNA was differentially expressed in the pigment deposition tissues, including eye, foot, feather follicle, skin of the back, as well as in skin of the abdomen. The expression level of the ASIP gene in skin of the abdomen was higher than that in skin of the back. Those findings will contribute to further understanding the functions of the ASIP gene in geese plumage colouring.

Bar-headed geese are renowned for migratory flights at extremely high altitudes over the world's tallest mountains, the Himalayas, where partial pressure of oxygen is dramatically reduced while flight costs, in terms of rate of oxygen consumption, are greatly increased. Such a mismatch is paradoxical, and it is not clear why geese might fly higher than is absolutely necessary. In addition, direct empirical measurements of high-altitude flight are lacking. We test whether migrating bar-headed geese actually minimize flight altitude and make use of favourable winds to reduce flight costs. By tracking 91 geese, we show that these birds typically travel through the valleys of the Himalayas and not over the summits. We report maximum flight altitudes of 7290 m and 6540 m for southbound and northbound geese, respectively, but with 95 per cent of locations received from less than 5489 m. Geese travelled along a route that was 112 km longer than the great circle (shortest distance) route, with transit ground speeds suggesting that they rarely profited from tailwinds. Bar-headed geese from these eastern populations generally travel only as high as the terrain beneath them dictates and rarely in profitable winds. Nevertheless, their migration represents an enormous challenge in conditions where humans and other mammals are only able to operate at levels well below their sea-level maxima.

We used observations of individually marked female black brant geese (Branta bernicla nigricans; brant) at three wintering lagoons on the Pacific coast of Baja California-Laguna San Ignacio (LSI), Laguna Ojo de Liebre (LOL), and Bahía San Quintín (BSQ)-and the Tutakoke River breeding colony in Alaska to assess hypotheses about carryover effects on breeding and distribution of individuals among wintering areas. We estimated transition probabilities from wintering locations to breeding and nonbreeding by using multistratum robust-design capture-mark-recapture models. We also examined the effect of breeding on migration to wintering areas to assess the hypothesis that individuals in family groups occupied higher-quality wintering locations. We used 4,538 unique female brant in our analysis of the relationship between winter location and breeding probability. All competitive models of breeding probability contained additive effects of wintering location and the 1997-1998 El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event on probability of breeding. Probability of breeding in non-ENSO years was 0.98 ± 0.02, 0.68 ± 0.04, and 0.91 ± 0.11 for females wintering at BSQ, LOL, and LSI, respectively. After the 1997-1998 ENSO event, breeding probability was between 2% (BSQ) and 38% (LOL) lower than in other years. Individuals that bred had the highest probability of migrating the next fall to the wintering area producing the highest probability of breeding.

Enterococci were detected occasionally in 100 L samples of water abstracted from a shallow aquifer in a natural dune infiltration area for drinking water production. Enterococcus moraviensis was the species most frequently identified in these samples. Because there are no existing reports of faecal sources of E. moraviensis and the closely related E. hemoperoxidus, this study aimed to find such sources of these two species in the dunes. Faecal samples from various animal species living in the vicinity of abstraction wells, were analysed for enterococci on Slanetz and Bartley Agar. From these samples, enterococci isolates (1,386 in total) were subsequently identified using matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. E. moraviensis was found in the faeces of geese, foxes and rabbits. Also, E. haemoperoxidus was isolated from goose faeces. Using hierarchical clustering, the species composition of Enterococcus spp. isolated from abstracted water formed one cluster with the species composition found in geese droppings. A sanitary survey supported the indication that feral geese may provide a substantial faecal load in particular parts of this dune infiltration area, close to the water abstraction system. This study confirms the faecal origin of E. moraviensis and E. haemoperoxidus from specific animals, which strengthens their significance as faecal indicators.

This study was conducted with the aim of determining the morphology, distribution and heterogeneity of mast cells in the tongues of seagull (Larus fuscus), common buzzard (Buteo buteo), goose (Anser anser), white stork (Ciconia ciconia) and Gerze rooster. The study used five samples of tongue material from each of the healthy adult avian species. The samples were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin (NBF) solution, then, after routine tissue follow-up, the samples blocked with paraplast. Cross-sections with 5-6 μm of thickness were stained with the 0.5% toluidine blue and alcian blue/safranin O (AB/SO). In all five avian species, it was found that the mast cells were in different sizes and round, oval or spindle-shaped based on their place of distribution. Mast cell numbers were determined in stained with toluidine blue, examined ×40 objectives in a 1 mm2 area. It was observed that mast cell density in subepithelial lamina propria and microscopic papilla was higher in the tongues of all species. Mast cell distribution and heterogeneity varied through the tongue, and there were more mast cells in the dorsal side of the tongue than the ventral side. The highest amount of mast cells was found in the tongue of the Gerze rooster among all five species. In the tongue cross-sections stained with the combined method of alcian blue/safranin O (AB/SO), the mast cells were stained as AB (+), SO (+) and AB/SO (+) (mixed).

Dansylated glycopeptides (DNS-GP) derived from ovalbumins (chicken, quail, goose and turkey) were treated with commercial endo-beta-N-acetyl-glucosaminidases (Endo-D and Endo-H). Susceptibility of DNS-GP components against those enzymes was examined by analysing the reaction product by HPLC. As reported previously (H. Iwase, Y. Kato and K. Hotta, 1984, Comp. Biochem. Physiol., 77B, 743-747), DNS-GP from chicken ovalbumin was separated into 13 peaks (C1-13) on HPLC. Beta-galactosidase treatment of the DNS-GP resulted in the disappearance of three peaks and the increase of their neighboring peaks. The results indicated that among 13 DNS-GP components from chicken ovalbumin, three (C6,8,11) were bearing galactose residue at the nonreducing terminal and another three (C7,9,12) would be bearing a galacto- sugar chain from each corresponded component.

Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine), an indole hormone, regulates a variety of important central and peripheral actions related to circadian rhythms and reproduction through its specific receptor subtypes (Mel-1a, Mel-1b and Mel-1c). However, the expression profile of melatonin receptor genes (MTNR1A, MTNR1B and MTNR1C) in ovarian hierarchical follicles of geese remains to be clarified. In this study, the expression level of melatonin receptors in small white follicle (SWF), small yellow follicle (SYF), the largest follicle (F1), second largest (F2), third largest (F3), fourth largest (F4), fifth largest (F5), and postovulatory follicle (POF) in the Sichuan white goose were examined using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The results showed that the expression levels of MTNR1A, MTNR1B and MTNR1C initially increased and later decreased. The highest levels of gene expression of these receptor subtypes were observed in F5 or F4 in all examined follicles. Furthermore, the expression of MTNR1A and MTNR1B mRNA was significantly greater in SYF compared with SWF (P<0.05), but MTNR1C was absent in SWF. The expression of MTNR1A, MTNR1B and MTNR1C mRNA was significantly greater in F5 compared with SYF (P<0.05), and the expression of MTNR1A and MTNR1C mRNA was higher in F1 compared with POF (P<0.05). In addition, the oestrogen concentration in SWF, SYF, F4, F3, F2, F1 and POF was measured using ELISA. The oestrogen concentration and melatonin receptor expression both were initially observed to increase and subsequently decrease. The oestrogen concentration in F4 and F3 was highest in all examined samples and was 1318.2pg/g and 1318.1pg/g, respectively. These results suggest that the melatonin receptor may be involved in the activation of the SWF and SYF to allow the SWF and SYF to develop into the subsequent follicles. Furthermore, follicles and the expression of the melatonin receptors may be regulated by the secretion of the oestrogen.

Goose down and duck down have very similar appearance but the quality of goose down is better than that of duck down in general. There is a highest allowable limit as specified by the various national standards of feather and down for the percentage of duck feather or down mixed in goose feather or down. Traditional detection method, manual inspection with a high-scale microscope, is labor intensive and not suitable for large-volume samples analysis and on-site rapid testing. In the present paper, visible/near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy combined with successive projection algorithm (SPA) for characteristic wavelengths selection was used to determinate the content of duck down mixed in goose down. In the range of 450-930 nm, the multiple linear regression (MLR) model established with the 8 characteristic wavelengths selected by SPA achieved good prediction, the correlation coefficient of 0.983, root mean square error of calibration (RMSEC) of 5.44%, and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 5.75%. Therefore, it is expected to be used for rapid detection of feather and down quality in future.

Using an ORF1b-based astrovirus-specfic reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay, a novel astrovirus-like was detected from domestic geese in China. Pairwise comparisons and phylogenetic analyzes suggested that a novel group of goose astrovirus, different with previously known astroviruses in the genus Avastrovirus, was found circulating in geese. This study has expanded our understanding about the role of domestic waterfowls as reservoirs for diverse astroviruses.

An outbreak of goose parvovirus (GPV) infection on a Swedish goose farm in the spring of 2004 increased the mortality rates from 2% in the early unaffected hatches to 90% and 99% respectively in the two hatches following virus introduction and 40% in goslings hatched later in the same breeding season. In this paper we describe the clinical observations, diagnostic procedures, and epidemiologic investigation carried out to elucidate the source of the infection. The diagnosis was confirmed by serology, virus isolation, and sequence analysis of a 493-bp-long fragment of the VP1 gene. Phylogenetically the causative virus was closely related to pathogenic GPV strains isolated in 2003 and 2004 from Poland and the United Kingdom, respectively. The Swedish isolate exhibited less homology with pathogenic strains from Hungary and Asia and with attenuated vaccine strains. The epidemiologic investigation showed that the virus was first introduced to a contract farm (farm A) and then was transferred with newly hatched goslings to the farm that had submitted the birds for necropsy (index farm). The exact time and source of the virus introduction to farm A could not be determined with absolute certainty. Possible sources of the infection included backyard goose eggs that had been delivered to farm A for subcontract incubation and hatching, wild geese that frequented the flock of breeding geese on pasture on farm A, and a clutch of Canada goose eggs (Branta canadensis) that had been produced by wild geese and was hatched in the same machine as the eggs produced by farm A.

A total of 240 embryonated goose eggs obtained from two susceptible flocks were used. Half of the eggs were inoculated into the allantoic cavity with a virulent strain (7593) of duck plague virus isolated from an acute outbreak, and the other half were inoculated with the attenuated vaccine virus (KAPEVAC). Ten, 100 or 1000 CPU/0.1 ml virus were given on days 12 and 20 of incubation. Embryos that died and surviving embryos killed at 5-day intervals were examined by light and electron microscopy. The yolk and the serum of embryos that survived until hatching were assayed for antibody content. Lymphocytes separated from the blood were used for the immuno-rosette formation and lymphocyte stimulation tests. Pathomorphological changes indicative of virus replication occurred in the liver, kidney, myocardium, gizzard muscle and chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of the embryos in the case of both virus strains. The time of onset and severity of these changes and the time and rate of embryonic mortality depended on the virulence of the strain used for inoculation, the virus dose and the time of inoculation. Virus-neutralizing (VN) antibodies were demonstrable neither in the yolk nor in the serum of goslings exsanguinated after hatching. The lymphocytes recognized the virus antigen in the in vitro cellular tests and responded to it with blastogenic transformation. As opposed to adult birds, in the embryos duck plague virus infection did not cause damage to the digestive tract mucosa and the lymphoid organs.

It has been demonstrated that ACSL3 and ACSL5 play important roles in fat metabolism. To investigate the primary functions of ACSL3 and ACSL5 and to evaluate their expression levels during goose fatty liver development, we cloned the ACSL3 and ACSL5 coding domain sequences (CDSs) of geese using RT-PCR and analyzed their expression characteristics under different conditions using qRT-PCR. The results showed that the goose ACSL3 (JX511975) and ACSL5 (JX511976) sequences have high similarities with the chicken sequences both at the nucleotide and amino acid levels. Both ACSL3 and ACSL5 have high expression levels in goose liver. The expression levels of ACSL3 and ACSL5 in goose liver and hepatocytes can be changed by overfeeding geese and by treatment with unsaturated fatty acids, respectively. Together, these results indicate that ACSL3 and ACSL5 play important roles during fatty liver development. The different expression characteristics of goose ACSL3 and ACSL5 suggest that these two genes may be responsible for specific functions.

The aim of this study was to determine the antibiotic susceptibility of 93 Lactobacillus strains isolated from domestic geese raised on Polish farms. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 13 antimicrobial substances was determined by the broth microdilution method. All strains were sensitive to the cell wall inhibitors ampicillin and amoxicillin (MIC ≤ 8 μg/ml). Resistance to inhibitors of protein synthesis and to fluoroquinolone inhibitors of replication was found in 44.1% and 60.2% of isolates, respectively; 26.9% strains were resistant to neomycin (MIC ≥ 64 μg/ml), 23.6% to tetracycline (MIC ≥ 32 μg/ml), 15% to lincomycin (MIC ≥ 64 μg/ml), 18.3% to doxycycline (MIC ≥ 32 μg/ml), 9.7% to tylosin (MIC ≥ 32 μg/ml), 56% to flumequine (MIC ≥ 256 μg/ml) and 22.6% to enrofloxacin (MIC ≥ 64 μg/ml). Bimodal distribution of MICs indicative of acquired resistance and unimodal distribution of the high MIC values indicative of intrinsic resistance were correlated with Lactobacillus species. Eleven (11.8%) strains displayed multiple resistance for at least three classes of antibiotics. Data derived from this study can be used as a basis for reviewing current microbiological breakpoints for categorisation of susceptible and resistant strains of Lactobacillus genus and help to assess the hazards associated with the occurrence of drug resistance among natural intestinal microflora.

Using an example of a goose which grew up in complete isolation, this article shows how escape behaviour increases through all its developmental steps by lack of a sufficient secure primary attachment object. If a gosling has no mother, its fear influences wide parts of its behaviour and blocks the capacity to approach another animal in order to form a new attachment. But the urge for attachment is still alive and provokes strong conflicts between this urge and fear. In these situations displacement activities and apathy occur--attachment-disordered behaviour. Under partly artificial circumstances, a change to 'normal' attachment behaviour took place by reduction of escape motivation, which enabled the goose to accept her brood. From this moment on the attachment-disordered behaviour, the displacement activity and the apathy disappeared. Implications to human behaviour are drawn--a comparison between displacement activity and neurotic symptoms, the state of apathy and personal disorder. A synthesis of ethological and psychoanalytical models concerning etiological and therapeutic aspects is discussed. Fear and attachment, not aggression and sexuality--our 'animal heritage'--are the primary factors which influence our development. The balance of fear and attachment is the basis for a healthy or unhealthy development of social relationships. This applies to social living animals as well as to humans.

The endocrine pancreas of birds contains 3 islet types and releases glucagon, insulin, somatostatin and avian pancreatic polypeptide (APP). Interactions between these hormones, and pancreatic hormone-plasma metabolite feedback mechanisms, are the main regulators of these secretions. In birds, total pancreatectomy induces a fatal hypoglycaemia associated with the disappearance of circulating glucagon, and an impaired glucose tolerance ascribed to the lack of insulin. Normoglycaemia can be restored in depancreatized birds by infusion of glucagon and insulin, provided that the G/I ratio is close to normal. Subtotal pancreatectomy provokes a diabetes characterized by a basal hyperglycaemia and an impaired glucose tolerance. However, while a transient diabetes is observed in most species, in the goose a permanent diabetes is obtained. These results point out the importance of the pancreas and especially of glucagon, in birds. This importance can also be detected in the protein metabolism, since total or subtotal pancreatectomy markedly increases the concentration of plasma aminoacids. As for lipid metabolism, in vivo and/or in vitro experiments have shown the sensitivity of the adipose tissue and liver cells to glucagon. Finally, contrary to the general opinion, insulin seems to be antilipolytic, as in mammals.

Measurements of plasma GLI and IRI in normal fasting geese, before and during constant I.V. infusion of saline, gave GLI/I ratios of 1.32 +/- .07 and 1.34 +/- .03 (w/w). As total pancreatectomy markedly reduces the pancreatic hormone level, leading to a mortal hypoglycaemia, we attempted to maintain plasma glucose within the normal range by constant I.V. infusion of glucagon and insulin into operated animals. The results as follows: 1. Blood glucose levels can be maintained within the normal range during experiments lasting 6 or more hours with a constant G/I ratio. 2. The G/I ratio obtained in operated animals (.96 +/- .12) is near to, but significantly lower (p less than .005) than, the GLI/I ratio measured in normal animals. This difference may be explained by the presence of a small amount of circulating gut GLI in the 2nd group.

An electrophoretical analysis of blood plasma proteins of eight Anser and two Branta species was performed. Ten polymorphic proteins in blood plasma pattern were distinguished and described: four prealbumin proteins, albumin, three postalbumin proteins, transferrin, and a single posttransferrin protein. Genus-specific and species-specific variants of Pr-1, Al, Pa-3, Pa-X, and Tf proteins were found. The species of Branta differed in Pr-1, Pa-3, Pa-X, and Tf loci. The Anser species differed, apparently, in allele frequencies of described gene loci. A single species-specific protein marker was found in swan geese only. The electrophoretic mobilities of Pr-1, TfB, and PtfA, B, and C were similar for several species of Anser and Branta genera.

To understand the phyletic evolution of geese, the complete mitogenome of the Zhedong goose was sequenced for the first time. It is composed of 37 genes and 1 control region, and the structure and arrangement of all genes sequenced are identical to those of other goose breeds. We confirmed the accuracy of the mitogenome sequence through RT-PCR and found numts from amplification in genomic DNA. Comparisons of the phylogenetic trees and sequences of geese that were suggested a clade of Chinese geese, except the Yili goose, were classified in the Euro clade. Several breed-specific mutations and Chinese breed-specific mutations were found. Our results suggest that Chinese geese evolved from the swan goose, splitting from their common ancestors at different times, which was consistent with studies before. Furthermore, numts in most genes of Zhedong goose clustered with European geese in the phylogenetic tree, suggesting that the haplotypes in the Euro clade might be more ancient. However, the mitogenome of the swan goose shows distinctive evolutionary positions in some genes, which suggest its unclear relationship with Chinese geese and European geese. The current study added to the understanding of the evolution of geese and provided evidence that the typing of numts is an encouraging way for the evolutionary study of geese and the mitochondrial genomes of geese deserve further investigation.

A red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) and a Canada goose (Branta canadensis) were evaluated for unilateral pelvic limb lameness. Physical examination findings and results of diagnostic imaging revealed femoral neck fractures in both birds. Both birds were treated with a femoral head and neck excision arthroplasty. The affected legs were not immobilized, and the birds were encouraged to use the legs immediately after surgery to encourage formation of a pseudoarthrosis. Within 2 weeks, both birds were using the affected limb well enough to be either successfully released or transferred to a wildlife rehabilitation facility. Femoral head and neck excision arthroplasty without immobilization of the limb is recommended for managing avian femoral neck fractures, especially in free-ranging species in which a rapid and complete or near complete return to function is vital for survival in the wild.

Avian hepadnaviruses are etiological agents of hepatitis B, that has been identified primarily in ducks, and more recently in various avian species. In this paper, 16 hepadnaviruses were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the field samples from dead embryos of commercially reared domestic duck and goose. Based on the molecular analysis of the S-protein gene sequences and phylogenetic Neighbor-joining tree, identified viruses were clustered in the same genetic group, indicating no host-related diversity. Both duck and goose-origin hepadnaviruses were grouped within the cluster consisting of "Western-country" and "Chinese" duck hepatitis B (DHBV) isolates, showing more evolutionary distances with other known avian hepadnaviruses. Histopathologically, the lesions observed in the liver tissue from hepadnavirus positive duck and goose embryos varied from low to mild degree of perivascular mononuclear cells and mixed cell infiltrations, followed by mild vacuolar changes. Small focal necrotic changes in the liver parenchyma, and bile ductular proliferation were also found in examined liver samples. Generally, the microscopic findings resemble those described in experimentally infected ducks, while this was the first description of hepadnavirus associated lesions in domestic goose. Although hepadnaviruses are considered to have a very narrow host range, this study showed that domestic ducks and geese are susceptible to infection with genetically almost identical hepadnaviruses, that were likely to produce similar microscopic changes in the liver of both duck and goose embryos. The impact of naturally occurred hepadnavirus infection and possible synergistic interactions with other infectious or non-infectious agents on embryo viability needs further investigation.

The present study was designed to investigate the potential role of immunization against inhibin on testicular development, plasma testosterone concentration and expression of relevant genes in hypothalamus, pituitary, Leydig and Sertoli cells in Yangzhou ganders. For this purpose, Yangzhou ganders, n = 30 were divided into groups A and B. Group B ganders were actively immunized against inhibin α-subunit, while group A ganders were immunized with bovine serum albumin (BSA), which served as control. Immunization against inhibin elevated testes weights. In addition, immunization against inhibin elevated GnRH, StAR, CYP11A1 and AMH mRNA transcription expressions as depicted by qRT-PCR. Furthermore, hypothalamic GnRH-I mRNA expressions were up regulated, while GnIH mRNA transcription expression showed reciprocal expression on day 227. LH-β mRNA transcription expression remained unaffected. In conclusion, our findings suggest that active immunization against inhibin affect spermatogenesis and testicular development through regulations of hypothalamic, pituitary and testicular genes expressions.

In practice, goose eggs are increasingly used and, therefore, the rheological properties have to be known for processing. The eggs of geese (Landes Goose, Anser anser f. domestica) were stored for one, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 wk at a constant temperature 4°C. First of all, the egg quality parameters were described in terms of egg weight, egg weight loss, egg shape index, yolk height, albumen height, yolk index, albumen index, and Haugh units. In the next step the rheological behavior of liquid egg products (egg yolk, albumen, and whole liquid egg) was studied using a concentric cylinder viscometer. Flow curves of all liquid egg products exhibited non-Newtonian shear thinning behavior. This behavior can be described using the Herschel-Bulkley model and for technical application using the Ostwald-de Waele model. The effect of the storage duration on the rheological behavior is different for the different liquid egg products. With the exception of very low shear rates, the viscosity of the egg yolk as well as of the whole liquid egg decreases with storage time. At lower shear rates there is a tendency toward increased albumen viscosity with storage duration. The storage duration also affects the mechanical properties of the eggshell membrane. This effect has been evaluated in terms of the ultimate tensile strength, fracture strain, and fracture toughness. All these parameters increased with the loading rate, but decreased during the egg storage. These mechanical phenomena should be respected, namely in the design of the egg model for the numerical simulation of the egg behavior under different kinds of the mechanical loading.

Explaining and predicting animal distributions is one of the fundamental objectives in ecology and conservation biology. Animal habitat selection can be regulated by top-down and bottom-up processes, and is mediated by species interactions. Species varying in body size respond differently to top-down and bottom-up determinants, and hence understanding these allometric responses to those determinants is important for conservation. In this study, using two differently sized goose species wintering in the Yangtze floodplain, we tested the predictions derived from three different hypotheses (individual-area relationship, food resource and disturbance hypothesis) to explain the spatial and temporal variation in densities of two goose species. Using Generalized Linear Mixed Models with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique, we demonstrated that goose density was positive correlated with patch area size, suggesting that the individual area-relationship best predicts differences in goose densities. Moreover, the other predictions, related to food availability and disturbance, were not significant. Buffalo grazing probably facilitated greater white-fronted geese, as the number of buffalos was positively correlated to the density of this species. We concluded that patch area size is the most important factor determining the density of goose species in our study area. Patch area size is directly determined by water levels in the Yangtze floodplain, and hence modifying the hydrological regimes can enlarge the capacity of these wetlands for migratory birds.

To assess the immunogenicity of an inactivated new type gosling viral enteritis virus (NGVEV) vaccine, we investigated 3 different doses of the inactivated vaccine and the inactivated vaccine in conjunction with 3 different doses of recombinant goose interleukin-2 (rGoIL-2) adjuvant. A virus concentration of 10(5) 50% embryo infective dose/mL was subcutaneously inoculated into adult geese divided into 6 groups. The dynamic changes of the humoral and cellular immunity responses elicited by the vaccines in the adult geese postvaccination (PV) were investigated using ELISA, virus neutralization test, and lymphocyte proliferation assay. The clearance of virus from the intestines of geese (175 d PV) was studied by histopathological examination and indirect immunofluorescence assay after virulent NGVEV challenge. This study showed that the inactivated NGVEV vaccine elicits strong humoral and cellular responses in the vaccinated adult geese. The absorbance values of specific anti-NGVEV antibodies, the neutralization antibody titer, and the lymphocyte proliferation index rapidly increased, peaked at about 28 d PV, progressed to the plateau stage, and then decreased slightly. The rGoIL-2 adjuvant enhanced the immune response, and this adjuvant in conjunction with the inactivated NGVEV vaccine induces a significantly higher specific anti-NGVEV antibody absorbance value, neutralization antibody titer, and lymphocyte proliferation index than the non-adjuvant-inactivated NGVEV vaccine (P < 0.05). The inactivated NGVEV vaccine conferred adequate efficient ability to clear NGVEV in vaccinated geese even in the last phase of the vaccination period (175 d PV). The inactivated NGVEV vaccine (0.5 mL/goose) with 1,000 units of rGoIL-2 adjuvant/goose is the most effective dose, thereby eliciting the strongest humoral and cellular immunity responses and providing the most efficacious clearance of NGVEV in vivo.

The high blood-O2 affinity of the bar-headed goose (Anser indicus) is an integral component of the biochemical and physiological adaptations that allow this hypoxia-tolerant species to undertake migratory flights over the Himalayas. The high blood-O2 affinity of this species was originally attributed to a single amino acid substitution of the major hemoglobin (Hb) isoform, HbA, which was thought to destabilize the low-affinity T state, thereby shifting the T-R allosteric equilibrium towards the high-affinity R state. Surprisingly, this mechanistic hypothesis has never been addressed using native proteins purified from blood. Here, we report a detailed analysis of O2 equilibria and kinetics of native major HbA and minor HbD isoforms from bar-headed goose and greylag goose (Anser anser), a strictly lowland species, to identify and characterize the mechanistic basis for the adaptive change in Hb function. We find that HbA and HbD of bar-headed goose have consistently higher O2 affinities than those of the greylag goose. The corresponding Hb isoforms of the two species are equally responsive to physiological allosteric cofactors and have similar Bohr effects. Thermodynamic analyses of O2 equilibrium curves according to the two-state Monod-Wyman-Changeaux model revealed higher R-state O2 affinities in the bar-headed goose Hbs, associated with lower O2 dissociation rates, compared with the greylag goose. Conversely, the T state was not destabilized and the T-R allosteric equilibrium was unaltered in bar-headed goose Hbs. The physiological implication of these results is that increased R-state affinity allows for enhanced O2 saturation in the lungs during hypoxia, but without impairing O2 delivery to tissues.

When formalinized instead of fresh goose erythrocytes were used in the hemagglutination (HA) test system of the Akabane virus, the agglutinability of the erythrocytes increased and became less salt-dependent. The improved method based on these findings should facilitate the hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test and may be useful for epidemiological studies of the Akabane virus.

1. Ovomucoids were purified from Muscovy duck, domestic duck and domestic goose. 2. Peptide maps of cyanogen bromide-cleaved ovomucoids from Muscovy duck and domestic duck were very similar to one another, but differed from that of goose. 3. Muscovy duck ovomucoid showed the same protease inhibitory pattern as ovomucoid from domestic duck, inhibiting trypsin in the molar ratio of 1:2 and chymotrypsin 1:1. 4. Inhibitory complexes could be detected between chymotrypsin and ovomucoid from both Muscovy and domestic duck, but not from goose, by using non-denaturing gels. 5. No complexes could be detected between DFP-inactivated chymotrypsin and any of the ovomucoids. 6. The results show that of ovomucoid from Muscovy duck more closely resembles that from domestic duck than goose.

A full-length cDNA encoding the goose (Anser anser) leptin receptor (LEPR) was cloned and sequenced. The goose LEPR gene encodes a 1,156-amino acid protein containing a signal peptide, a single transmembrane domain and specific motifs involving putative leptin-binding and signal transduction. The deduced goose LEPR protein shows more than 90% identity to duck and 75% identity to chicken and turkey. Quantitative real-time analysis reveals that the goose LEPR is predominantly expressed in brain. The expression of LEPR in goose adipocytes can be up-regulated by oleic acid in vitro. Moreover, the expression levels of genes, which have been demonstrated to be related to adipocyte differentiation, are down-regulated in LEPR-knockdown adipocytes, indicating LEPR's potential role in adipocyte differentiation in goose.

Recent advances in genomics have greatly increased research opportunities for non-model species. For wildlife, a growing availability of reference genomes means that population genetics is no longer restricted to a small set of anonymous loci. When used in conjunction with a reference genome, reduced-representation sequencing (RRS) provides a cost-effective method for obtaining reliable diversity information for population genetics. Many software tools have been developed to process RRS data, though few studies of non-model species incorporate genome alignment in calling loci. A commonly-used RRS analysis pipeline, Stacks, has this capacity and so it is timely to compare its utility with existing software originally designed for alignment and analysis of whole genome sequencing data. Here we examine population genetic inferences from two species for which reference-aligned reduced-representation data have been collected. Our two study species are a threatened Australian marsupial (Tasmanian devil Sarcophilus harrisii; declining population) and an Arctic-circle migrant bird (pink-footed goose Anser brachyrhynchus; expanding population). Analyses of these data are compared using Stacks versus two widely-used genomics packages, SAMtools and GATK. We also introduce a custom R script to improve the reliability of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calls in all pipelines and conduct population genetic inferences for non-model species with reference genomes.

Exercise at high altitude is extremely challenging, largely due to hypobaric hypoxia (low oxygen levels brought about by low air pressure). In humans, the maximal rate of oxygen consumption decreases with increasing altitude, supporting progressively poorer performance. Bar-headed geese (Anser indicus) are renowned high altitude migrants and, although they appear to minimize altitude during migration where possible, they must fly over the Tibetan Plateau (mean altitude 4800 m) for much of their annual migration. This requires considerable cardiovascular effort, but no study has assessed the extent to which bar-headed geese may train prior to migration for long distances, or for high altitudes. Using implanted loggers that recorded heart rate, acceleration, pressure, and temperature, we found no evidence of training for migration in bar-headed geese. Geese showed no significant change in summed activity per day or maximal activity per day. There was also no significant change in maximum heart rate per day or minimum resting heart rate, which may be evidence of an increase in cardiac stroke volume if all other variables were to remain the same. We discuss the strategies used by bar-headed geese in the context of training undertaken by human mountaineers when preparing for high altitude, noting the differences between their respective cardiovascular physiology.

The gut microbime plays an important role in the health of wild animals. This microbial community could be altered by habitat pollution and other human activities that threaten the host organisms. Here, we satellite-tracked a flock of swan geese (Anser cygnoides) migrating from their breeding area (Khukh Lake, Mongolia), with low levels of human activity, to their wintering area (Poyang Lake, China) which has been heavily impacted by human activities. Twenty fecal samples were collected from each site. High-throughput sequencing of 16S and ITS was employed to explore bacterial and fungal composition and diversity of their gut microbiome. Although general composition, alpha-diversity, functional prediction, and the central taxa in the phylogenetic networks showed some similarities between the two habitats, significant divergences were detected in terms of beta-diversity, species abundances, and interaction network topologies. In addition, disease-related and xenobiotic biodegradation pathways, and pathogenic bacteria were significantly increased in bacterial communities from samples at Poyang Lake. Our results reveal that the gut microbiome of swan geese, while somewhat altered after long-distance migration, still maintained a core group of species. We also show that habitat environmental stress could impact these gut microbial communities, suggesting that habitat pollution could indirectly threaten wild animals by altering their gut microbiome.

Theory predicts persistence of long-term family relationships in vertebrates will occur until perceived fitness costs exceed benefits to either parents or offspring. We examined whether increased breeding probability and survival were associated with prolonged parent-offspring and sibling-sibling relationships in a long-lived Arctic migrant herbivore, the Greenland white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons flavirostris). Although offspring associated with parents for 1-13 years, 79 % of these associations lasted two or less years. Only 65 (9.9 %) of the 656 marked offspring bred once in their lifetime, and just 16 (2.4 %) bred twice or more. The probability of birds with siblings breeding successfully in a subsequent year was credibly greater than that of independent birds at ages 5, 6, and 7. Survival of offspring with parents was credibly greater than that of independent/nonbreeder birds at all possible ages (i.e., ages 2-7+). A cost-benefit matrix model utilizing breeding and survival probabilities showed that staying with family groups was favored over leaving until age 3, after which there were no credible differences between staying and leaving strategies until the oldest ages, when leaving family groups was favored. Thus, most birds in this study either departed family groups early (e.g., at age 2, when the "stay" strategy was favored) or as predicted by our cost-benefit model (i.e., at age 3). Although extended family associations are a feature of this population, we contend that the survival benefits are not sufficient enough to yield clear fitness benefits, and associations only persist because parents and offspring mutually benefit from their persistence.

A flock of 117, 10-month-old Egyptian geese consisting of 90 females and 27 males were utilized in this investigation. Birds were randomly divided into three equal groups, each made up of three replicates of 10 females and 3 males each. The first group was kept under a pasture system (PS) and allowed to swim in water ducts during the daytime (PS) and kept inside the house during the night. The second group of birds were kept in confinement in a house and fed ad libitum on a commercial feed (intensive system (IS)). Birds in the third group (semi-intensive system (SIS)) were released from the house for 6 h a day and given access to the pasture and water ducts. Each group was housed in three pens (replicates) in the SIS. They were given ad libitum access to the commercial feed when in the house. Each pen measured (2 × 3 m2). Natural mating was practiced during the period from November to the end of May. BW of geese under ISS was significantly (P ⩽ 0.05) higher than those under PS and SIS. Egg number, weight and mass of geese in the SIS system were significantly (P ⩽ 0.05) greater than those of geese in the PS and IS systems. Fertility and hatchability percentages were significantly (P ⩽ 0.05) greater in the PS (84.2% and 88.6%) than in the IS (77.5% and 82.8%) and SIS systems (80.7% and 85.5%). Shell weight and thickness were significantly (P ⩽ 0.05) better in the IS and SIS systems than in the PS system. Geese in the PS and SIS systems exhibited significantly higher plasma estradiol-17 and progesterone than those in the IS. Testosterone was significantly higher in IS than in the other systems. Semen quality factor was significantly higher in the PS and SIS systems than in the IS system. Carcass weight was significantly greater in IS and SIS geese than in PS geese, but the PS system resulted in a decreased percentage skin, abdominal fat and liver. Total amount of meat produced per geese was significantly greater in the SIS than in the IS system and greater in the IS than in the PS system.

Various organs of goslings and Muscovy duck chickens were investigated by electron microscopy, with the negative contrast technique being used in a routine diagnosis programme. Investigations were extended over several years and were, more specifically, applied to 1,148 samples obtained from 525 goslings and 429 samples which had been collected from 139 Muscovy duck chickens. Viruses were directly detected in 132 or 76 samples. Parvoviruses were predominant in geese and Muscovy ducks and accounted for 83.3 or 94.7%. Rotaviruses, reoviruses, and adenoviruses were sporadically diagnosed. Most of all positive findings were recorded from intestinal matter, liver, and heart. Parvovirus-related diseases were practically removed from among goslings, owing to efficient immunoprophylaxis on all larger goose units. Small privately owned flocks were found to play a role as pathogen reservoirs for both goslings and Muscovy ducks.

While many molecular alterations in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common primary malignant brain tumor, have been defined, the intricate signaling networks associated with these alterations that represent actionable therapeutic targets are less well established. Chen and colleagues leverage a Drosophila GBM model to identify a conserved signaling axis downstream of the EGFR and PI3K that involves the death-associated protein kinase (Drak), a cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase orthologous to the human kinase STK17A. Functional studies revealed that targeting this signaling axis attenuated mitosis and cytokinesis, providing a new pathway for therapeutic development in GBM.See related article by Chen et al., p. 1085.

This study was carried out to describe the arterial supply of Meckel's diverticulum (MD) in geese, using 36 adult healthy geese of both sexes, 50 to 52 weeks of age. The arterial supply of MD was classified into three types, In the first type, MD was supplied by a very distinct branch from the cranial mesenteric artery in 21 geese. In the second type, it was supplied by one terminal branch from the cranial mesenteric artery in 9 geese. In the third type, it was supplied both by one branch from the jejunal artery and by terminal branch from the cranial mesenteric artery in 6 geese. Based on the these types, we found significant differences (p < or = 0.01) in the length of MD between type I and II. The blood supply of the third type was observed more frequently in the male than in the female. Results from this study may contribute to the anatomical knowledge of arterial supply of MD in the geese.

An abrupt decrease of the mitotic index occurs between the 15th and the 18 day of incubation. This decrease is concomitant withthe appearance of glycogen first and of lipids later. The differenciation implicated by this biochemical specialisation is correlative of a lowering of cellular multiplication ability, according to A. Prenant's general law.

In birds, a variety of subtotal thoracic spinal cord lesions were made to determine the spinal cord pathways essential for avian hind limb locomotion (bipedal walking). The various surgical disruptions included: section of the dorsal half of the cord, a hemisection, section of the dorsal cord and ventromedial funiculi, section of the dorsal cord ventrolateral funiculi, section of the entire thoracic cord except for one ventrolateral quadrant, section of the ventral half of the cord, and complete transection of the thoracic cord. The study compared the locomotion following these lesions in both chronic surviving and acutely decerebrated, brain stem-stimulated birds. Behavioral assessments and electromyographic recording techniques were used to evaluate locomotor activity. Our results showed that transectioning pathways within the dorsal cord did not hinder the activation and maintenance of self-supported walking in either preparation. However, sparing the spinal cord pathways within either the ventromedial or ventrolateral funiculi of the thoracic spinal cord was essential for the activation of self-supported walking in both preparations. When our findings are integrated with previous studies, medullary reticulospinal pathways (projecting through the ventral funiculi) are strongly implicated as a common descending projection for the activation of spinal cord locomotor networks and the initiation of locomotion. Similar findings have been found in quadrapedal mammals and, as a complement, birds may make an excellent model for the study of bipedal locomotion.

1. Experiments were conducted to assess the influence of caecectomy on amino acid availability (AAA) of three feedstuffs for goose. 2. Nine caecectomised and 9 intact Yangzhou ganders, 24 weeks old, were used in these experiments. Fish meal, soybean meal and cottonseed meal were used as the sole source of protein. The endogenous amino acid (AA) losses were evaluated by a nitrogen (N)-free diet method. The influence of caecectomy on apparent amino acid availability (AAAA) in fish meal, soybean meal and cottonseed meal was assessed in experiment 1 and true amino acid availability (TAAA) of three protein diets was determined in experiment 2. 3. Results showed that, in the soybean meal and cottonseed meal, the AAAA and TAAA of most AA determined by the intact ganders were higher than in the caecectomised ganders; in the fish meal, the AAAA and TAAA of most AA determined by the intact ganders were lower than in the caecectomised ganders. 4. Results of the present study suggest that the effect of caecectomy on AAA in geese was dependent on the feedstuff assayed, and it was better to use caecectomised poultry for AAA assessment.

1. Histone H1 from chicken, turkey, duck and goose erythrocytes was resolved into six bands and that from quail into seven bands in an acetic acid-urea polyacrylamide gel. 2. A fast migrating minor subtype H1.e was detected in avian erythrocytes using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 3. Although histone subtype H1.z from quail, turkey and duck was well separated in acid-urea gel, a similar protein in goose was found only in two-dimensional gel. This spot was absent in chicken. 4. Histone H1 spots .c, .c' and .d migrate in two-dimensional gel in a relatively constant manner forming a triangle-shaped pattern that facilitates comparison of H1 subtypes among various avian species.

Goose parvovirus (GPV), a small non-enveloped ssDNA virus, can cause Derzsy's disease, and three capsid proteins of VP1, VP2, and VP3 are encoded by an overlapping nucleotide sequence. However, little is known on whether recombinant viral proteins (VPs) could spontaneously assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs) in insect cells and whether these VLPs could retain their immunoreactivity and immunogenicity in susceptible geese. To address these issues, genes for these GPV VPs were amplified by PCR, and the recombinant VPs proteins were expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system for the characterization of their structures, immunoreactivity, and immunogenicity. The rVP1, rVP2, and rVP3 expressed in Sf9 cells were detected by anti-GPV sera, anti-VP3 sera, and anti-His antibodies, respectively. Electron microscopy revealed that these rVPs spontaneously assembled into VLPs in insect cells, similar to that of the purified wild-type GPV virions. In addition, vaccination with individual types of VLPs, particularly with the rVP2-VLPs, induced higher titers of antibodies and neutralized different strains of GPVs in primary goose and duck embryo fibroblast cells in vitro. These data indicated that these VLPs retained immunoreactivity and had strong immunogenicity in susceptible geese. Therefore, our findings may provide a framework for development of new vaccines for the prevention of Derzsy's disease and vehicles for the delivery of drugs.

Results of research showing an evident influence of the host's species, strain and age on the biology of the parasite have been presented. Various Hymenolepididae and Amidostomum anseris served as models. Irregular growth and development of the parasite in a given host species cannot be used as a sure criterion to determine the quality of the host-parasite system, because this irregularity occurs sometimes in a specific host, too. It is proposed that a host can only be regarded as specific for a particular species of parasite if its life cycle can be completed and development of successive generations can be assured. Not only the main host but an auxiliary, incidental or side one can play the role of a specific host.

Interferons, as the first line of defense against the viral infection, play an important role in innate immune responses. Type III interferon (IFN-λ) was a newly identified member of IFN family, which plays IFN-like antiviral activity. Towards a better understanding of the type III interferon system in birds, type III interferon lambda receptor (IFNLR1) was first identified in the Chinese goose. In this paper, we had cloned 1952 bp for goose IFNLR1 (goIFNLR1), including an ORF of 1539 bp, encoding a 512-amino acid protein with a 20 aa predict signal peptide at its N terminal and a 23 aa transmembrane region. The predicted amino acid sequence of goIFNLR1 has 90%, 73%, and 34% identity with duck IFNLR1 (predicted sequence), chicken IFNLR1, and human IFNLR1, respectively. And the age-related tissue distribution of goIFNLR1 was identified by Real Time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), we found that the goIFNLR1 has a mainly expression in epithelium-rich tissues similar to other species', such as small intestinal, lung, liver, and stomach. Moreover, a relatively high expression of goIFNLR1 was also observed in the secondary immune tissues (harderian gland and cecal tonsil). The identification and tissue distribution of goIFNLR1 will facilitate further study of the role of IFN-λ in goose antiviral defense.

Theories of ageing predict a trade-off between metabolism, reproduction, and maintenance. Species with low investment in early reproduction are thus expected to be able to evolve more efficient maintenance and repair mechanisms, allowing for a longer potential life span (intrinsic longevity). The erosion of telomeres, the protective caps at the ends of linear chromosomes, plays an important role in cellular and organismal senescence, signalling the onset of age-related disease due to accumulation of unrepaired somatic damage. Using extensive longitudinal data from a long-term study of a natural population of barnacle geese Branta leucopsis, we investigated individual rates of telomere length changes over two years in 34 birds between 0 and 22 years of age, covering almost 80% of the species' lifespan.

Gut GLI levels were measured in the plasma of normal, totally and subtotally depancreatized geese, using an antiserum specific for avian pancreatic glucagon and another one which crossreacts with intestinal extracts. Gut GLI was determined by difference between "total" GLI and immunoreactive pancreatic glucagon (IRG). Glucose given orally or a meal rich in carbohydrates elicited an elevation in plasma gut GLI. The increment of gut GLI was greater when the pancreas was removed. The over-stimulation of gut GLI was corrected by the administration of insulin. This is the first study which reports a correlation between insulin and gut GLI secretion in birds.

The design of an instrument deployed in a project studying the high altitude Himalayan migrations of bar-headed geese (Anser indicus) is described. The electronics of this archival datalogger measured 22 × 14 × 6.5 mm, weighed 3 g, was powered by a ½AA-sized battery weighing 10 g and housed in a transparent biocompatible tube sealed with titanium electrodes for electrocardiography (ECG). The combined weight of 32 g represented less than 2% of the typical bodyweight of the geese. The primary tasks of the instrument were to continuously record a digitised ECG signal for heart-rate determination and store 12-bit triaxial accelerations sampled at 100 Hz with 15% coverage over each 2 min period. Measurement of atmospheric pressure provided an indication of altitude and rate of ascent or descent during flight. Geomagnetic field readings allowed for latitude estimation. These parameters were logged twice per minute along with body temperature. Data were stored to a memory card of 8 GB capacity. Instruments were implanted in geese captured on Mongolian lakes during the breeding season when the birds are temporarily flightless due to moulting. The goal was to collect data over a ten month period, covering both southward and northward migrations. This imposed extreme constraints on the design's power consumption. Raw ECG can be post-processed to obtain heart-rate, allowing improved rejection of signal interference due to strenuous activity of locomotory muscles during flight. Accelerometry can be used to monitor wing-beat frequency and body kinematics, and since the geese continued to flap their wings continuously even during rather steep descents, act as a proxy for biomechanical power. The instrument enables detailed investigation of the challenges faced by the geese during these arduous migrations which typically involve flying at extreme altitudes through cold, low density air where oxygen availability is significantly reduced compared to sea level.

The oocyst morphology and endogenous development of Eimeria stigmosa Klimes, 1963 in a domestic goose (Anser anser domesticus L.) was studied using light and electron microscopy. The oocyst wall consisted of two layers. The outer layer formed densely accumulated protrusions, whilst the inner layer was smooth and formed a collar structure around the micropyle. Meronts were observed in the posterior part of the jejunum, along the whole length of the ileum and in Meckel's diverticulum within 1-4 days post infection (DPI). Sexual generation was found in the caecum and colon 4-5 DPI. All endogenous stages were located intranuclearly in enterocytes, predominantly in the apical part of the villi in distinct parasitophorous vacuoles. Numerous different developmental stages were frequently found in one nucleus. Current evidence indicates the existence of only one asexual generation formed by ectomerogony. During the development of asexual stages, invaginations into the body of a meront by the host cell nucleoplasm were observed.

Wild waterfowl in the order Anseriformes are recognized reservoirs for influenza A viruses (IAVs); however, prevalence of infection can vary greatly by species. Few isolates of IAVs have been reported from snow geese (Chen caerulescens), and generally they have not been regarded as an important component of this reservoir. In February 2013, 151 combined cloacal and oropharangeal swabs and 147 serum samples were collected from snow geese wintering on the Gulf coast of Texas. None of the swab samples tested positive by virus isolation, but antibodies to IAVs were detected in 87 (59%) birds tested by competitive blocking ELISA (bELISA). To further characterize these detected antibodies, positive samples were tested by virus microneutralization (MN) for antibodies to viruses representing 14 hemagglutinin subtypes (HA1-HA12, H14, and H15). By MN, antibodies to H1 (n = 41; 47%), H5 (n = 32; 37%), H6 (n = 49; 56%), H9 (n = 50; 57%), and H12 (n = 24; 28%) were detected. Snow goose populations have increased in North America since the 1960s, and their association with agricultural lands provides a potential indirect source of IAV infection for domestic poultry. This potential, as well as the detection of antibodies to HA subtypes H5, H9, and H12 that are not well represented in other waterfowl species, suggests that further snow geese surveillance is indicated.

Broodiness, a maternal behavior and instinct for natural breeding in poultry, inhibits egg production and affects the poultry industry. Phenotypic and physiological factors influencing broodiness in poultry have been extensively studied, but the molecular regulation mechanism of broodiness remains unclear. Effective research strategies focusing on broodiness are hindered by limited understanding of goose developmental biology. Here we established the transcriptomes of goose follicles at egg-laying and broody stages by Illumina HiSeq platform and compared the sequenced transcriptomes of three types of follicles (small white, large white and small yellow). It was found that there were 92 up-regulated and 84 down-regulated transcription factors and 101 up-regulated and 51 down-regulated hormone-related genes. Many of these genes code for proteins involved in hormone response, follicular development, autophagy, and oxidation. Moreover, the contents of progesterone and estradiol in follicles were altered, and the autophagy levels of follicles were enhanced during the broody stage. These results suggest that hormone- and autophagy-signaling pathways are critical for controlling broodiness in the goose. We demonstrated that transcriptome analysis of egg-laying and broody Zhedong white goose follicles provided novel insights into broodiness in birds.

Goose VLDV-neurophysin (mesotocin-associated neurophysin) has been purified from posterior pituitary glands through molecular sieving on Sephadex G-75 and high-pressure reverse-phase liquid chromatography on Nucleosil C-18 columns. Despite apparent molecular mass of unreduced VLDV-neurophysin measured by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with sodium dodecylsulfate appeared near 17 kDa, this value fell to 11 kDa after reduction with mercaptoethanol, suggesting the existence of a homodimer. Complete amino acid sequence (93 residues) of goose VLDV-neurophysin has been determined. N- and C-terminal sequences of the protein have been established by Edman degradation (microsequencing) and use of carboxypeptidase Y, respectively. Peptides derived from oxidized or carboxamidomethylated neurophysin by trypsin or staphylococcal proteinase hydrolyses have been isolated by high-pressure liquid chromatography and microsequenced, allowing determination of the complete sequence. Comparison within the vertebrate VLDV-neurophysin lineage, namely goose VLDV-neurophysin to mammalian VLDV-neurophysins and to deduced toad VLDV-neurophysin, reveals a residue insertion between positions 66 and 67 in the nonmammalian VLDV-neurophysins. When goose MSEL-neurophysin (vasotocin-associated neurophysin) and goose VLDV-neurophysin are compared to their bovine counterparts, identical substitutions are found in positions 17 (Asn in both goose neurophysins instead of Gly in both ox neurophysins), 18 (Arg instead of Lys), 35 (Tyr instead of Phe), and 41 (Thr instead of Ala). Identity of the sequences 10-74 in both ox neurophysins has been explained by partial gene conversion between oxytocin and vasopressin genes, and identical substitutions in both goose neurophysins might reveal a similar gene conversion between mesotocin and vasopressin genes in birds.

The purpose of this case study is to examine how environmental disruption and agricultural practices act synergistically to create a perfect storm for the spread of avian influenza. Actors in this case study include the vast permafrost landscape of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau; a wild goose that migrates over the Himalayas; the highest altitude railway in the world that traverses the plateau into Tibet; and an avian virus (H5N1). Commencing in 2001, tens of thousands of railway workers travelled to remote regions of the plateau to work on the railway. In order to feed and shelter these workers, the Chinese government established captive-bred goose farms as a source of high protein food. Beginning in 2005 and continuing in subsequent years, Qinghai Lake was the scene for the unprecedented appearance of avian influenza among migratory geese. This was a key moment in the global spread of H5N1 to poultry on three continents. Remote sensing technology suggested an ecological pathway for the transfer of avian viruses among chickens, captive-bred geese, and wild geese. Within a region experiencing rapid climate change, Qinghai Lake is warming even faster than the global average. This may relate to the persistent outbreaks of avian flu strains from Qinghai during the past twelve years. Globally, exponential increases in bird flu outbreaks are not merely a matter of chance mutations in flu viruses but also a result of antecedent social and environmental factors. The Qinghai case study provides real-world examples that bring these factors into sharp focus.

Ubiquitin-specific protease 18 (USP18) is known as an inhibition factor and has been associated with the innate immune response to pathogens. USP18 is the only deconjugating protease with specificity for interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), which is supposed to be missing in birds. To analyze the efficacy of goose USP18 (goUSP18) against Tembusu virus (TMUV) infection, we first cloned USP18 homologous cDNA from TMUV infected geese. The coding sequence was 1131 bp, and the deduced amino acid sequence shared conserved motifs with its homologues. Tissue-specific expression has shown that goUSP18 transcripts are strongly expressed in the spleen and liver of adult geese, as well as in the pancreas of goslings. Moreover, the goUSP18 transcripts were induced by goose interferons (goIFN) in goose embryo fibroblasts (GEF) and by TLR ligands in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Notably, goUSP18 transcripts were highly up-regulated by TMUV infection compared to the basal level in uninfected birds. Taken together, these results suggested that goUSP18 was involved in host innate immunity against TMUV infection.

In adult geese, chronic polygraphic recordings of EEG, EOG, EMG, ECG and respiratory rate completed with behavioral observations allowed the characterization of four states of vigilance: wakefulness (W), drowsiness (D), slow wave sleep (SWS) and paradoxical sleep (PS). The EEG, EOG, EMG general patterns observed during W, D, SWS and PS episodes with nuchal isotonia or hypotonia were similar to those reported in other birds. The characteristic brevity of avian PS was confirmed since this sleep state occupied only 2.8% of the nycthemere in geese. For the first time in an adult bird it was shown that numerous PS episodes were accompanied, as in mammals, by a total disappearance of nuchal EMG activity. These observations made in a bird species with a stable head support when sleeping, suggest that, as in mammals, inhibitory mechanisms leading to a PS related nuchal atonia do exist and that head falling is not the cause of PS episodes brevity in birds.

1. In this study, geese (Anas cygnoides) embryonic pituitary cells were cultured in vitro to determine if glucocorticoids could induce growth hormone (GH) expression and to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in this process. 2. On embryonic day 15 (e15) and e20 the pituitary cells were treated with corticosterone (CORT), membrane impermeable bovine serum albumin-conjugate corticosterone (CORT-BSA), dexamethasone (DEX), and a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist (RU486) to detect responsiveness of somatotrophs to glucocorticoids. 3. Treatment with CORT, CORT-BSA, and DEX for as little as 6 h increased the percentage of GH-positive cells (P < 0.01) and increased GH mRNA expression (P < 0.01) in e15 goose pituitary cells compared to the control. CORT significantly increased the level of GH protein secreted from cultured e15 goose embryonic pituitary cells, and CORT-BSA increased GH secretion from e20 goose embryonic pituitary cells. 4. A significant increase was observed in the glucocorticoid receptor in GR transcription levels (P < 0.01) with CORT, CORT-BSA, and DEX treatment. Furthermore, the CORT-stimulated GH mRNA expression was completely negated by pre-treatment with RU486. 5. These findings demonstrate that glucocorticoids can stimulate somatotroph differentiation in vitro, as characterised by enhanced GH protein secretion andmRNA expression in cultured geese embryonic pituitary cells. The membrane GR was involved in pituitary somatotroph differentiation induced by glucocorticoids during the embryonic development of geese.

Seasonal patterns of fecal 17beta-OH-androgen, estrogen, and progesterone equivalents of male and female greylag geese (Anser anser) were analyzed in a flock of free-living geese. These were compared among social categories determined by pairbond status and breeding success. The annual cycle was divided into 13 phases. Phasewise intra-sexual comparisons were made between social categories. The seasonal variation obtained from feces was in general agreement with the literature on plasma patterns in geese and other temperate-zone birds. However, there were distinct differences in seasonal hormone patterns among the social categories. In unpaired males, androgen was elevated for a longer period of time during sexually active phases compared with paired males. In male geese, high levels of androgen did not interfere with parenting but were related to pairbond status, whereas in females, androgen and progesterone were positively related to parental behavior. In the Fall, androgen, progesterone, and estrogen peaked only in unpaired males. In unsuccessful females, estrogen started to increase earlier in the Winter and was higher in amplitude and duration than that in females guarding offspring. In general, fecal steroids showed a clear-cut difference only between sexually active and parental phases of the year in the successfully breeding pairs, whereas unpaired males retained a hormonal state closer to sexually active phases throughout the year.

The autonomous goose parvovirus (GPV) and the human helper-dependent adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV2) share a high degree of homology. To determine if this evolutionary relationship has a biological impact, we studied viral replication in human 293 cells and in embryonated goose eggs coinfected with both viruses. Similar experiments were performed with the minute virus of mice (MVM), an autonomous murine parvovirus with less homology to AAV2. In human 293 cells, both GPV and MVM augmented AAV2 replication. In contrast, AAV2 markedly enhanced GPV replication in embryonated goose eggs under conditions where a similar effect was not observed with MVM. AAV2 did not replicate in embryonated goose eggs and AAV2 inactivated by UV-irradiation also enhanced GPV replication. To our knowledge, this is the first report that a human helper-dependent member of the Parvoviridae can provide helper activity for an autonomous parvovirus in a natural host.

A simple method for determination of lysine residue number and positive charge of histones H1 and H5 in the acetic acid -- urea system has been developed. The method is based on incomplete succinylation of lysine residues and allows an accurate determination of protein molecular length. The accuracy of the method has been demonstrated by determination of goose and chicken histones H5 and their fragments. The calibrating curve for determination of molecular lengths of histones H1 and H5 has been plotted. Using the incomplete succinylation method, a detailed analysis of Lymantria dispar histone H1 structure has been carried out. The method under discussion can be used for determining lysine residue number, positive charge and molecular length of practically any protein.

Surveillance of apparently healthy ducks, chickens, and geese at a poultry dressing plant in Hong Kong yielded 51 haemagglutinating viruses 25 of which were influenza A viruses. Of these, 24 were subtyped into 13 combinations based on haemagglutinin and neuraminidase surface antigens. Of the 13 different influenza A viruses isolated, 7 possessed combinations of haemagglutinin and neuraminidase subunits that have not been reported previously-i.e., Hav2N1, Hav2Nav5, Hav4N2, Hav7N2, Hav7Nav1, Hav7Nav3, and Hav7Nav6. Four of the isolates were non-avid: they were not neutralized by antisera to any of the reference subtypes of influenza A viruses, yet antisera to each isolate inhibited both that virus and a known reference strain. The large number of combinations of haemagglutinin and neuraminidase and the isolation of two different influenza A viruses from one duck suggests that recombination may be occurring in nature.

A novel goose calicivirus (GoCV) was sequenced. The 8013-nt-long genome was organized into two open reading frames that were in the same frame and separated by 3 nucleotides. This feature is similar to what has been observed in turkey calicivirus (TuCV). Comparison of GoCV with other caliciviruses showed that it shared the highest amino acid sequence identities of 62, 38, and 52% in the nonstructural protein, VP1, and VP2, respectively, with TuCV. Phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid sequences of nonstructural protein and VP1 demonstrated that GoCV was most closely related to but distinct from TuCV. Thus, GoCV was identified as a novel member in the proposed genus Nacovirus.

Bar-headed geese cross the Himalayas on one of the most iconic high-altitude migrations in the world. Heart rates and metabolic costs of flight increase with elevation and can be near maximal during steep climbs. Their ability to sustain the high oxygen demands of flight in air that is exceedingly oxygen-thin depends on the unique cardiorespiratory physiology of birds in general along with several evolved specializations across the O2 transport cascade.

Many different physiological changes have been observed in wild waterfowl during the flightless stage of wing moult, including a loss of body mass. We aimed to determine whether captive barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) would show the characteristic decrease in body mass during their wing moult, even though they had unlimited and unrestricted access to food. Fourteen captive geese were weighed at 1-2-week intervals for two complete years. During the flightless period of the moult, body mass decreased by approximately 25% from the pre-moult value. To understand the basis of this change, the rate of oxygen consumption was measured during daytime and nighttime at six points in the second year, and at three points (before, during and after wing moult) behavioural observations were made. Measurements of the rate of oxygen consumption showed an 80% increase above that of the nonmoulting periods of the year. We propose that metabolism was increased during moult because of the cost of feather synthesis. Although food was available, the captive birds chose not to forage and instead increased the proportion of time spent resting. It is likely that this behaviour in response to wing moult is a strategy to avoid predation in the wild. Thus, the innate nature of this behaviour has potential survival value for wild birds of this species. We conclude that the increase in metabolism led to the use of endogenous energy reserves because the birds reduced rather than increased their food intake rates, and as a result, the barnacle geese lost body mass during wing moult.

In the cat and goose, studies have been undertaken to determine the ultrastructure of airway epithelia, the concentration and distribution of the secretory cells which produce respiratory tract mucus, and the histochemistry of mucins located within cells and on their luminal surfaces. By electron microscopy all the 11 cell types so far described can be found in the airways of the cat but not the goose. Both goblet cells and submucosal glands are abundant in the cat whereas the trachea of goose lacks the latter, having instead abundant goblet cells many of which form 'intraepithelial glands'. Histochemically, the goblet cells of the cat and goose are similar in that they contain mucins with a predominance of sulphate esters. A surface mucosubstance can be demonstrated which, histochemically, is similar to that described in dog and man. Interestingly, this surface layer may be sloughed in response to an inhaled irritant such as ammonia and thereby contribute to the respiratory tract mucus recovered experimentally. Incorporation into macromolecules of radioactively labelled mucin precursors is assessed by autoradiography of tissue sections, and preliminary results of experiments designed to test the response of mucus-secreting cells to airway irritation and the parasympathomimetic drug, pilocarpine, are also presented.

Granulosa cells (GCs) are essential components of follicles and are involved in regulating the process of follicles development. However, comparative studies on GCs isolated from different staged follicles have not been conducted in goose. The aim of the present study was to identify the growth characteristics of goose GCs from pre-hierarchical (6-10 mm) and hierarchical (F4-F2, F1) follicles. Our results showed that the three cohorts of cells had different tolerance to collagenase and had noticeable morphological differences. The F1 granulosa layers were fully digested by 0.1% collagenase, while higher concentration (0.3%) was used for both F4-F2 and pre-hierarchical granulosa layers. In the state of suspension, the diameter of F1 individual cell was larger than the other two cohorts. However, after adhering to the culture plate, cells of F1 just had changes in the diameter accompanied by small bright spots, while both pre-hierarchical and F4-F2 GCs proliferated rapidly with spreading and irregularly shaped voids. Furthermore, all attached cells could be stained by the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor antibody. Analyses of both growth curve and the mRNA expression profiles of genes related to cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and steroidogenesis suggested that three cohorts of in vitro cultured GCs had different physiological viability and functions. Taken together, the present study not only revealed differences of the growth characteristics among three cohorts of goose GCs from pre-hierarchical, F4-F2 and F1 follicles, but also optimized the in vitro culture system of geese different staged GCs.

In a natural mating system, the sexual behavior of birds has an important role in fertility success. Non-competitive mating system provides special conditions to study gander-goose interactions. Behavioral and physiological data from a domestic geese breeding flock was used to determine interrelationships between mating activity (MA) parameters, sperm penetration assay (SPA), plasma testosterone (T) concentration, and fertility (F). Moreover, variation in the frequency of gander-goose interactions during the intensive breeding period and the diurnal rhythm (short day - 10L:14D) were evaluated. The 2-/3-year-old ganders (n=15) and 1-/3-year-old geese (1♂:4♀) were observed. On the basis of successful copulation (SCop), groups of ganders with low (33.3%), intermediate (40%), and high (26.7%) frequency were categorized. Frequency of SCop was greater in the morning than in the afternoon. For the entire breeding period, SPA results obtained for the low frequency group were less than for the intermediate group. Fertility success for ganders from both low and intermediate groups was similar. There was a lack of association between MA, plasma T concentration, and SPA results. However, SCop was positively correlated with fertility. It is recommended that SCop be considered as a prognostic parameter for monitoring of ganders' reproductive potential. It is recommended that the sexual behavior of ganders be evaluated before the 1200h of the day. The SCop with an average frequency of 0.4-0.8 times during the day light hours appears to be associated with fertility results that are satisfactory for geese husbandry. Additionally, the SPA may be considered for identification of ganders with poor reproductive potential to facilitate the decision of changes in harem social structure during the first half of the breeding season.

A heavy infection with schistosomes of the genera Trichobilharzia and Dendritobilharzia was considered the cause of 90% mortality in a group of 40 wild-caught Atlantic brant geese (Branta bernicla hrota) that were maintained in captivity on a fresh-water pond in Aurora, Ontario. Numerous adult worms and eggs were disseminated in many organs throughout the body of all birds examined. The main pathological findings, attributed to both eggs and adults, included emaciation, thrombosis of the caudal mesenteric vein and its branches, fibrinohemorrhagic colitis, and in some birds, heptomegaly. Translocation of brant geese from their natural marine environment to a fresh-water pond may have caused them to be exposed to parasites which they would not normally encounter.

The presence of a goose red blood cell (RBC) agglutinin (HA) in the culture medium of apparently uninfected Aedes albopictus cells raised the possibility of contamination by an arbovirus. The HA sedimented in sucrose gradients between 18S and 28S and had a buoyant density in sucrose of 1,23 g/cm3. The HA adsorbed to concanavalin A-Sepharose and could be eluted with alpha-methyl-D-mannoside. The apparent molecular weights of the eluted glycoproteins were estimated by PAGE to range from 17,000 to 45,000. Treatment of culture medium from A.albopictus cells with excess goose RBC removed both HA activity and a proportion of the proteins of molecular weight 25,000--35,000. The HA also bound to human group 'O' RBC, It was not possible to inhibit hemagglutination with a variety of anti-arbovirus antisera. These data do not support the hypothesis that the HA is associated with an inapparent arbovirus infection of A.albopictus cells.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of nine electrical stunning methods using various frequency and voltage combinations on the occurrence of engorged blood vessels in goose liver. Two hundred seventy Gourmaud geese (liver-type line SI 14) were slaughtered at 12 wk of age, in groups of 90 at three different times. Thirty birds each were subjected to one of the nine stunning methods. Neck cutting was performed immediately after stunning. The duration of exsanguination was 11 min. After completion of bleeding, the birds were scalded, defeathered manually, and kept refrigerated. At 1 d postmortem, the carcasses were eviscerated and cut up. From the slaughterhouse, the livers chilled in ice were transported to the cannery where they were weighed and graded at 2 d postmortem and were further processed. All of the veins and capillaries full of blood were removed from livers, because their presence was a hazard to product quality by causing discoloration of the canned liver, and the percentage of liver weight loss was then determined. The loss in liver weight due to removal of engorged blood vessels was reduced (P < 0.05) at 350 Hz, 70 to 90 V, and 80 to 85 mA when compared to the results obtained with any other stunning method tested. It was concluded that the use of high-frequency currents for electrical stunning of liver geese might have considerable commercial advantages.

Millions of birds in the United States die annually due to vehicle collisions on roads. Collisions may be of particular interest for species of conservation concern, such as the endangered Hawaiian goose (Nēnē), which is endemic to Hawai'i. Using a nearly 40-year dataset of Nēnē road mortality in and around Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park, we sought to answer the following research questions: 1) has Nēnē mortality changed over time? 2) are there times of the year in which mortality is greatest and does it relate to specific events in the species' lifecycle? 3) does age at mortality differ over time, space, or sex? 4) given that existing mortalities appear to occur only in certain locations, do the number of mortality events differ across these locations; 5) does mortality rate show any density dependence? and, 6) are mortality rates related to numbers of visitors or vehicles? Between 1977 and 2014, a total of 92 Nēnē died from vehicle collisions; while absolute mortality increased over this time, the mortality rate remained the same. Similarly, average age of mortality increased over time, but did not differ by location or sex. Between 1995 and 2014, Nēnē population size and mortality rates were not correlated. Mortality was greatest in November and December (breeding season) and lowest in June. Most of the mortality occurred along just three stretches of road in and around the park, with the number of mortalities split about evenly inside and outside of the park. Furthermore, Nēnē mortality was unrelated to the number of visitors or traffic volume in the park. These findings suggest vehicle collisions are a growing concern for Nēnē, but that management actions to reduce mortality can be targeted at specific road segments and times of the year.

Expanding populations of farmland foraging geese are causing escalating conflict with agriculture. We used questionnaires to investigate farmers´ perceptions in mid-Norway of spring staging geese and the extent to which they attempt to reduce pasture damage by goose scaring. We predicted farmers' scaring effort (a measure of dissatisfaction) to increase on fields closer to goose roosting sites where goose grazing intensity was highest (measured by dropping counts). Results showed no such relationship, suggesting that farmers' perception of goose use was not linked to actual goose use, but influenced by sociological factors and individual opinion. These results confirm the need to distribute subsidies/compensation to affected farmers based upon quantifiable measures of goose use rather than complaint levels. To avoid further conflict escalation, it is equally important that managers are aware of farmers´ perceptions and their causes, to effectively target communication about policies and measures to mitigate goose-agriculture problems.

Susceptibility to fatty liver in the force-fed goose is partly under genetic control. However, the mechanisms leading to liver steatosis in this avian model are poorly understood, but may involve perturbation in hepatic lipoprotein synthesis. Plasma lipoproteins were fractionated by density gradient ultracentrifugation from plasma of geese differing in their susceptibility to liver steatosis (Landes breed, highly susceptible; Rhine breed, partly resistant). The concentrations and chemical compositions of the major lipoprotein classes (VLDL, IDL, LDL and HDL) were characterized at 8, 22 and 27 wk of age and compared to the lipid composition of the corresponding liver. In non-force-fed geese, the lipoprotein profile was typical of birds, with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) predominating (4-5 g/L). However, at 22 and 27 wk of age, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) levels were significantly lower in Landes geese suggesting that this breed may possess a lower ability to export liver lipids, which would explain its susceptibility to liver steatosis when overfed. The livers of force-fed geese were specifically enriched in triglyceride, and to a lesser extent, in cholesteryl esters and non-esterified fatty acids as compared to those of control geese of the same age (27 wk). This accumulation of lipids was more pronounced in the Landes breed and was responsible for the higher liver weight in that breed. In both breeds, liver steatosis was accompanied by an increase in plasma levels of HDL (11 g/L), whereas low-density lipoproteins were essentially absent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).

Here, we report the characterization of three avian β-defensins (AvBDs) from the goose, named anser_AvBD1, AvBD3, and AvBD6, respectively. All of anser_AvBDs exhibited broad antibacterial activity. In addition, the antibacterial activity of all of the AvBDs against Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis decreased significantly in the presence of 100mM NaCl (P<0.01). None of the AvBDs showed hemolytic activity. In order to assess the significance of these anser_AvBDs in the infection of Salmonella enteritidis, mRNA expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and anser_AvBDs in tissues of both control and infected geese was evaluated. We observed a significant up-regulation of TLR4, anser_AvBD1, 3, and 6 in some immune tissues evaluated, in response to S. enteritidis infection. These data demonstrated that TLR4 may serve a possible role in eliciting host immune responses to pathogens, and β-defensins may play a pivotal role in the host defense mechanisms of the goose.

In breeding geese, natural mating applies. The objective of this study was to determine seasonal- and age-related changes in the sexual activity of ganders. Moreover, T, T4 and T3 plasma levels were evaluated. The study was conducted on 2/3-year-old males (n=15) and 1- or 2/3-year-old females (1♂:4♀). Sexual activity of ganders was characterized through the frequency of: courtship, attempts at and successful copulations and total mating activity (MA). Reproductive results manifested by egg production and fertility were recorded. Laying percentage (January-June) was 37.1 and 28.6% for 1-, and 2/3-year-old geese, respectively. MA was noted before the sexual maturity of females and the T level peak. MA was highest at the onset and during peak production (March) for ganders kept with 1-, and 2/3-year-old geese, respectively. From April to May a decrease in fertility with a reduction of the frequency of copulations was observed. At this time low levels of T were noted. The effect of goose age on the MA was shown, with higher frequency of copulations for ganders kept with 1-year-old geese. We suggest that in the successful seasonal mating in geese, social factors such as the presence of females and female age play an important role. The reduction in fertility during the spring period may be associated with decreases in the efficiency of successive mating sequences. The higher frequency of copulations without affecting fertility, for ganders kept with young geese, may be because of differences in sperm transfer or storage/transport efficiency.

Sera from birds of the order Anseriformes in Czechoslovakia were examined for virus neutralizing (VN) antibodies to arboviruses. VN antibodies to Sindbis, Calovo and Tahyna viruses were found in 15, 5 and 6 out of 106 greylag goose (Anser anser) sera. Out of 38 ducks, 6 mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and 1 garganey (Anas querquedula) contained VN antibodies to Sindbis virus, 6 mallards to Calovo virus, 4 mallards and 1 garganey to Tahyna virus, 2 mallards and 1 garganey to tick-borne encephalitis (TE) virus and 1 mallard to West Nile (WN) virus.

During prolonged fasting, birds must rely on glucose mobilization to maintain normoglycemia. Glucagon is known to modulate avian energy metabolism during prolonged fasting, but the metabolic effects of this hormone on long-distance migrant birds have never been investigated. Our goal was to determine whether glucagon regulates the mobilization of the main lipid and carbohydrate fuels in migrant birds. Using the Canada goose (Branta canadensis) as a model species, we looked for evidence of fuel mobilization via changes in metabolite concentrations. No changes could be found for any lipid fraction, but glucagon elicited a strong increase in glucose concentration. Therefore, we aimed to quantify the effects of this hormone on glucose kinetics using continuous infusion of 6-[(3)H]-d-glucose. Glucagon was found to cause a 50% increase in glucose mobilization (from 22.2 ± 2.4 μmol·kg(-1)·min(-1) to 33.5 ± 3.3 μmol·kg(-1)·min(-1)) and, together with an unchanged rate of carbohydrate oxidation, led to a 90% increase in plasma glucose concentration. This hormone also led to a twofold increase in plasma lactate concentration. No changes in plasma lipid concentration or composition were observed. This study is the first to demonstrate how glucagon modulates glucose kinetics in a long-distance migrant bird and to quantify its rates of glucose mobilization.

Changes in the plasma titers of follicle-stimulating hormone were investigated in a free-living population of barheaded geese over the whole year. Adult males had pronounced seasonal changes from prebreeding levels of approximately equal to 20 ng/ml to a peak in the breeding season of about 300 ng/ml. Changes in females were only slight. An increase from nondetectable, approximately equal to 20 ng/ml to a mean of 32.2 ng/ml before egg-laying was found. The data are discussed with regard to the literature on free-living species and the previously published data on LH and testosterone levels in the same birds.

The aim of this work was to study the effects of incorporating sugar beet pulp (SBP) into the diet on the development of the crop and performance of geese. A total of 480 1-day-old ganders were divided into three groups differing in the composition and mode of distribution of the diet offered from day 56 to 89. The following two diets were used: a standard diet (nitrogen-corrected apparent metabolizable energy, AMEn 11.44 MJ/kg; 160 g/kg CP) or a diet containing 10% of SBP (SBP diet; AMEn 11.47 MJ/kg; 160 g/kg CP). The swelling capacity (SC) hydration was higher for SBP than for the standard diet (3.62 v. 2.72 ml of H2O/g of dry matter at 60 min; P<0.05). In the Control group, birds were fed with a controlled time of access to a standard diet. Other birds were fed the SBP diet with a controlled time of access (SBPt group) or a controlled quantity offered (SBPq). From day 90 to 104, 88 birds/group were overfed with a mixture containing mainly corn. Body traits including volume of the crop were measured at day 89. Fatty liver weight and commercial grading were measured at d 104. Feed intake from day 56 to 89 was higher in the Control group than in the SBPt group (8097 v. 7545 g; P<0.05), feed intake in the SBPq group being intermediate (7801 g); however, live weights (LW) of the birds were similar in the three groups measured at day 89 (5746 g; P>0.05). At day 89, the volume of the crop tended to be higher in the SBPt compared with the Control group (52.8 v. 48.8 ml/kg of LW; P=0.101). After overfeeding, feed intake (12 922 g), weight gain (2412 g), LW (8170 g), fatty liver weight (875 g) and commercial grading of the fatty liver were similar (P>0.1) for all the three groups. Therefore, SBP could help adapt the digestive tract of waterfowl to high feed intake through an increase in the crop volume, but its method of use - that is, level of incorporation and mode of distribution - should continue to be investigated.

Social stressors are known to be among the most potent stressors in group-living animals. This is not only manifested in individual physiology (heart rate, glucocorticoids), but also in how individuals behave directly after a conflict. Certain 'stress-related behaviors' such as autopreening, body shaking, scratching and vigilance have been suggested to indicate an individual's emotional state. Such behaviors may also alleviate stress, but the behavioral context and physiological basis of those behaviors is still poorly understood.

1. The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 8 (LRP8), a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene family, participates in the supplying of lipid during follicular development. The objective of the study was to identify and characterise the LRP8 gene in goose. 2. A 2867 bp fragment that covered the complete coding region (CDS) of goose (Anser cygnoides) LRP8 gene was cloned. It encoded a protein of 917 amino acid residues containing a 24-amino acid signal peptide and 5 functional domains. The goose LRP8 showed high nucleic acid and amino acid identities with those in other species. 3. Similarly to duck LRP8 gene, two splice variants of LRP8, LRP8-1 (containing 8 ligand-binding repeats) and LRP8-2 (containing 7 ligand-binding repeats), were identified in goose. 4. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicates that the LRP8-1 transcript is expressed in heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, breast muscle, duodenum, hypothalamus, pituitary and ovary, negligible or absent in sebum and oviduct, and the LRP8-2 transcript is widely expressed in all examined tissues. 5. A total of 7 SNPs were identified in the coding region of the goose LRP8 gene.

Understanding causes of death can aid management and recovery of endangered bird populations. Toward those ends, we systematically examined 300 carcasses of endangered Hawaiian Geese (Nene; Branta sandvicensis) from Hawaii, Maui, Molokai, and Kauai between 1992 and 2013. The most common cause of death was emaciation, followed by trauma (vehicular strikes and predation), and infectious/inflammatory diseases of which toxoplasmosis (infection with Toxoplasma gondii) predominated. Toxicoses were less common and were dominated by lead poisoning or botulism. For captive birds, inflammatory conditions predominated, whereas emaciation, trauma, and inflammation were common in free-ranging birds. Mortality patterns were similar for males and females. Trauma predominated for adults, whereas emaciation was more common for goslings. Causes of death varied among islands, with trauma dominating on Molokai, emaciation and inflammation on Kauai, emaciation on Hawaii, and inflammation and trauma on Maui. Understanding habitat or genetic-related factors that predispose Nene (particularly goslings) to emaciation might reduce the impact of this finding. In addition, trauma and infection with T. gondii are human-related problems that may be attenuated if effectively managed (e.g., road signs, enforcement of speed limits, feral cat [Felis catus] control). Such management actions might serve to enhance recovery of this endangered species.

Migratory ducks, Canada geese, and sandhill crane from the Pacific North American Flyway have been screened for Campylobacter spp. Samples (298) from these birds were examined and the incidence of Campylobacter spp. in the samples were as follows: sandhill crane (Grus canadensis tabida), 81%; ducks (Aythya collaris, Anas carolinensis, Aythya americana, and Anas platyrhynchos), 73%; and Canada geese (Branta canadensis), 5%. All isolates were identified as Campylobacter jejuni. To our knowledge this is the first report of the isolation of C. jejuni from sandhill crane. The high frequency of isolation in both the sandhill crane and migratory ducks indicated that these bird populations may play a significant role in the dissemination of the bacterium. Because of their migratory habits, these birds may be particularly important in spreading C. jejuni to remote areas.

Two azaphilone pigments (1 and 2), two dihydrobenzofurans (3 and 4), two macrodiolides (5 and 6), and a dimeric alkyl aromatic constituent (7) were isolated from the goose dung-derived fungus Coniella fragariae. Compounds 1-3 proved to be new natural products. Coniellins H and I (1 and 2) feature a tetracyclic core and an aldehyde group at C-5, which is unusual for azaphilone derivatives. The X-ray structure of pyrenophorin (5) is reported for the first time. Pyrenophorin (5) showed strong cytotoxicity against several cancer cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 0.07 to 7.8 μM.

Birds that fly over mountain barriers must be capable of meeting the increased energetic cost of climbing in low-density air, even though less oxygen may be available to support their metabolism. This challenge is magnified by the reduction in maximum sustained climbing rates in large birds. Bar-headed geese (Anser indicus) make one of the highest and most iconic transmountain migrations in the world. We show that those populations of geese that winter at sea level in India are capable of passing over the Himalayas in 1 d, typically climbing between 4,000 and 6,000 m in 7-8 h. Surprisingly, these birds do not rely on the assistance of upslope tailwinds that usually occur during the day and can support minimum climb rates of 0.8-2.2 km·h(-1), even in the relative stillness of the night. They appear to strategically avoid higher speed winds during the afternoon, thus maximizing safety and control during flight. It would seem, therefore, that bar-headed geese are capable of sustained climbing flight over the passes of the Himalaya under their own aerobic power.

We report the complete genome sequence of a new avastrovirus of goose-origin (FLX). The 7299-nt-long genome consisted of three overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) that were in different reading frames. Pairwise comparisons showed that the FLX genome was 59% identical to its closest relatives and that the levels of amino acid identity shared by FLX with other astroviruses did not exceed 54% in ORF1a, 66% in ORF1b, and 50% in ORF2, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid sequence of the full-length ORF2 demonstrated that FLX was highly divergent from all other avastroviruses. At the amino acid level the complete capsid region of FLX shared genetic distances of 0.574-0.719 with three official avastrovirus species, suggesting that it can be classified as a member of a novel species in the genus Avastrovirus.

We studied gas exchange in anesthetized ducks and geese artificially ventilated at normal tidal volumes (VT) and respiratory frequencies (fR) with a Harvard respirator (control ventilation, CV) or at low VT-high fR using an oscillating pump across a bias flow with mean airway opening pressure regulated at 0 cmH2O (high-frequency ventilation, HFV). VT was normalized to anatomic plus instrument dead space (VT/VD) for analysis. Arterial PCO2 was maintained at or below CV levels by HFV with VT/VD less than 0.5 and fR = 9 and 12 s-1 but not at fR = 6 s-1. For 0.4 less than or equal to VT/VD less than or equal to 0.85 and 3 s-1. less than or equal to fR less than or equal to 12 s-1, increased VT/VD was twice as effective as increased fR at decreasing arterial PCO2, consistent with oscillatory dispersion in a branching network being an important gas transport mechanism in birds on HFV. Ventilation of proximal exchange units with fresh gas due to laminar flow is not the necessary mechanism supporting gas exchange in HFV, since exchange could be maintained with VT/VD less than 0.5. Interclavicular and posterior thoracic air sac ventilation measured by helium washout did not change as much as expired minute ventilation during HFV. PCO2 was equal in both air sacs during HFV. These results could be explained by alterations in aerodynamic valving and flow patterns with HFV. Ventilation-perfusion distributions measured by the multiple inert gas elimination technique show increased inhomogeneity with HFV. Elimination of soluble gases was also enhanced in HFV as reported for mammals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).

Studied were the changes in the values of some hematologic indices (hemoglobin, erythrocytes, leukocites) as well as the values of some biochemical (total protein and protein fractions, urea, total lipids, bilirubin, inorganic, phosphorus calcium) and enzyme factors (lactatedehydrogenase, alkaline and acid phosphatase, aldolase, amino transferrases, creatinephosphokinase) in geese prior to and after experimental infection of Borrelia anserina. It was found that in the peak stage of spirochetemia the content of hemoglobin, total lipids, and calcium, the percent of albumins and alfa-globulins, and the activity of the alkaline phosphatase in the blood decreased. The prealbumin fraction of the serum protein was completely reduced. The activity of the lactatedehydrogenase, acid phosphatase, amino transferrases, and aldolase showed higher values that were statistically significant, while the activity of the creatinephosphokinase rose to a slighter extent. The urea, bilirubin, inorganic phosphorus, and the alfa-, beta-, and gamma-globulins correlated positively with the course of the infection.

Four hemagglutinating agents were isolated from 100 cloacal samples collected from migratory water foul during the 1977 hunting season in Michigan. Three of the isolates are paramyxoviruses and they show no reactivity with antisera to Newcastle disease virus. The fourth isolate is an orthomyxovirus, A/Duck/Michigan/77 (Hsw1 Nav2). Under experimental conditions two of the paramyxoviruses were recovered from the intestinal tract of chicks, and the third paramyxovirus was recovered from both the respiratory and intestinal tract of chicks. One paramyxovirus was pathogenic for chicks. The type A influenza virus was recovered from both the respiratory and intestinal tracts of chicks and caused subclinical infections.

1. Histone 5 stains metachromatically with Coomassie Blue R-250, a property shared only with collagens and procollagens, histones 1 and 2B, and possibly certain proline-rich salivary gland proteins. 2. Coomassie Blue-stained goose and chicken H5 induce the same degree of metachromasia, which is intermediate between that induced by H1 and H2b. 3. The absorption spectra of all Coomassie Blue-stained gel bands consist of a primary maximum at 555 nm, but the absorption spectra of H5 gel bands also include a prominent shoulder in the vicinity of 525 nm, a region in which H1 gel bands display a secondary maximum. 4. The possible role of proline-rich sequences in the induction of metachromasia is discussed.

Concentration of Fe, Zn, Cu and Pb were determined in the brain tissue of wild (bean goose, Anser fabalis, n = 14, and white-fronted goose, A. albifrons, n = 3) and domestic (A. anser f. domestica, n = 13) geese. The results are referred to 1 g fresh weight (micrograms/g). Out of 17 wild geese, 4 individuals showed a very high Pb level. Statistically significant differences in concentrations of the metals studied were found between the white-fronted and domestic geese; for 3 metals (Fe, Zn, Cu), differences between the bean and white-fronted geese were statistically significant as well. The two bean goose types, tundra and taiga, were found to differ in terms of their brain Zn and Cu concentrations: the tundra type geese showed higher content of the metals than those in the taiga type.

To sustainably exploit a population, it is crucial to understand and reduce uncertainties about population processes and effects of harvest. In migratory species, management is challenged by geographically separated changing environmental conditions, which may cause unexpected changes in species distribution and harvest. We describe the development in the harvest of Svalbard-breeding pink-footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus) in relation to the observed trajectory and migratory behaviour of the population. In autumn, geese migrate via stopover sites in Norway and Denmark (where they are hunted) to wintering grounds in the Netherlands and Belgium (where they are protected). In Denmark and Norway harvesting increased stepwise during the 2000s. The increase in the population size only partly explained the change. The change corresponded to a simultaneous stepwise increase in numbers of geese staging in Denmark throughout autumn and winter; geese also moved further inland to feed which collectively increased their exposure to hunting. In Norway the increase in harvest reflected greater utilisation of lowland farmland areas by geese, increasing their hunting exposure. The study demonstrates how changes in migratory behaviour can abruptly affect exposure to hunting, which showed a functional response to increased temporal and spatial availability of geese. The harvest has now reached a level likely to cause a population decline. It highlights the need for flexible, internationally coordinated hunting regulations and reliable up-to-date population estimates and hunting bag statistics, which are rare in European management of migratory waterbirds. Without such information decisions are left with judgments based on population estimates, which often have time lags of several years between recording and reporting, hampering possibilities for the timely adjustment of management actions.

Newcastle disease virus (NDV) belongs to the Paramyxoviridae family and has had a great impact on the poultry industry. In the past, NDV strains were generally pathogenic only to fowls, but goose paramyxovirus (goose-origin APVM-1) is highly infectious to waterfowl, and, thus, there have been frequent outbreaks in China since 1997. In this study three pairs of specific primers were designed to detect the virulence of different NDV and goose-origin APVM-1 isolates and to differentiate between NDV and goose-origin APVM-1 using multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Pathogenicity tests were performed to confirm multiplex RT-PCR results. Data from our study indicate that multiplex RT-PCR is a convenient, low-cost, and effective technique for rapid identification. Twenty-six viral isolates of NDV and four goose-origin APVM-1 were analyzed, and we found that the VII genotype of NDV is the most prevalent type in South China and that it is not closely related to viral strains common to Europe.

The peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) belongs to a large family of nuclear receptors. This study was designed to clone and sequence analysis of cDNA encoding PPAR from goose. The RT-PCR method was developed to clone the cDNA, and the lengths of cDNA encoding PPARalpha and PPARgamma were 1407bp and 1428bp respectively. The cDNAs of the two genes were cloned and sequenced for the first time. The identities of CDS of PPARalpha and PPARgamma gene were 87.43% and 92.00% by homologous comparison among goose and other five species, and that were 93.38% and 96.95% in amino acid sequences. The further analysis among seventeen species including goose showed that the identities of PPAR genes were low(66.18%) among different sub-type (alpha,gamma,beta) of PPAR genes and that was high for the same sub-type of PPAR genes: PPARalpha, PPARgamma and PPARbeta (or PPARdelta) were 84.80%, 86.23% and 87.36% respectively. The results showed that these two genes are conservative in the process of evolution and has important physiological function for the growth and development of birds and mammals. The results of the present study will benefit the further study of relationship between PPAR genes and the growth and development, especially in fat metabolism of goose.

1. The OPAE random primers (Operon Technologies, Inc., CA) were used for random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fingerprinting in Chinese, White Roman and Landaise geese. One of these primers, OPAE-06, produced a 938-bp sex-specific fragment in all females and in no males of Chinese geese only. 2. A novel female-specific DNA sequence in Chinese goose was cloned and sequenced. Two primers, CGSex-F and CGSex-R, were designed in order to amplify a 912-bp sex-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragment on genomic DNA from female geese. 3. It was shown that a simple and effective PCR-based sexing technique could be used in the three goose breeds studied. 4. Nucleotide sequencing of the sex-specific fragments in White Roman and Landaise geese was performed and sequence differences were observed among these three breeds.

Very low arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2) experienced by birds during high-altitude flight may result in cerebral vasoconstriction and reduced cerebral O2 delivery. To examine this possibility, we measured regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) and tissue PO2 in pentobarbital-anesthetized geese (Anser domesticus). Twenty-five-micrometer Teflon-coated platinum electrodes for H2-clearance measurements of local blood flow or tissue PO2 were implanted in the cerebral cortex in 11 geese. Tissue H2 and O2 were measured by voltage clamping the electrodes at +0.30 and -0.5 V, respectively. Washout kinetics of H2 gas administered via unidirectional lung ventilation was used to calculate local blood flow for those electrodes exhibiting one- or two-compartment washout kinetics of H2 (128 of 296 washouts in 31 electrodes). PaCO2 was controlled between 8 and 55 mmHg by altering pulmonary gas flow or by adjusting inspired PCO2. CBF decreased as PaCO2 fell from 50 to 20 mmHg but did not decrease further as PaCO2 was reduced below 20 mmHg. CBF was uniformly distributed in different regions of the cortex. Despite the plateau in CBF during severe hypocapnia, tissue PO2 continued to decline as PaCO2 fell below 20 mmHg. Severe alkalosis may limit cerebral O2 delivery in birds during high-altitude flight.

A light microscopic study of serial sections of the hearts of 64 avian embryos (chicken, turkey, duck and goose) was undertaken in order to elucidate the development of the atrioventricular bundle and its branches. The developing atrioventricular bundle and its branches were shown to appear simultaneously (at about a third of the way through incubation) as relatively large, discrete fasciculi, which were dark-staining when compared with developing cardiac muscle. Prior to the appearance of the bundle and branches, the developing conducting tissue was found to be present as a widespread precursor tissue, which was distributed as a complete, dark-staining subendocardial sleeve, lining the whole of the ventricular canal, ventriculobulbar loop, and extending into the common atrial cavity. From these observations, it is concluded that, with septation and chamber formation, the tissue of the sleeve is partly incorporated within the chamber walls to give origin to diffuse Purkinje tissue, and is partly retained as the bundle and branches. The manner of derivation of the bundle and branches is discussed, and it is stressed that the definitive positions of the bundle and branches denote the junctional zones of the components of septation.

Greening of the Arctic due to climate warming may provide herbivores with richer food supplies, resulting in higher herbivore densities. In turn, this may cause changes in vegetation composition and ecosystem function. In 1982-1984, we studied the ecology of non-breeding moulting geese in Jameson Land, low Arctic East Greenland. By then, geese consumed most of the graminoid production in available moss fens, and it appeared that the geese had filled up the available habitat. In 2008, we revisited the area and found that the number of moulting geese and the temperature sum for June-July had tripled, while the above-ground biomass in a moss fen ungrazed by geese had more than doubled. In a goose-grazed fen, the overall plant composition was unchanged, but the frequency of graminoids had decreased and the area with dead vegetation and open spots had increased. We suggest that climate warming has lead to increased productivity, allowing for higher numbers of moulting geese. However, the reduction of vegetation cover by grazing may have longer term negative consequences for the number of geese the habitat can sustain.

IGF1 mRNA expression in breast muscle in Taihu geese was significantly higher than that in Wanxi geese and the MSTN mRNA level in leg muscle in Taihu geese was significantly higher than that in Wanxi geese. 3. There was no significant difference in breast muscle MSTN or leg muscle IGF1 mRNA expression between the two breeds. 4. Within the same breed, the IGF1 mRNA expression in leg muscle of male geese was significantly higher than that in female geese, and MSTN mRNA expression in leg muscle was significantly higher than that in breast muscle. 5. There was no difference in the IGF1 mRNA expression between tissues. 6. There was a positive correlation between IGF1 mRNA and MSTN mRNA and a negative correlation between IGF1 mRNA expression of breast muscle and leg muscle ratio. 7. In Wanxi geese, MSTN mRNA expression in leg muscle was negatively associated with body weight and leg muscle weight.

Changes in plasma testosterone (T), thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), semen output and remex moult were studied in domestic ganders. A bimodal pattern in both plasma T and sperm concentration was observed during the annual cycle. Ganders started to produce semen at the end of January; maximum semen volume (0.32 +/- 0.04 ml) and sperm concentration (148 +/- 38 x 10(3)/mm3) were reached in March and a marked decrease was observed after mid-April, when the moult of the remiges began. Plasma T3 levels peaked in February (9.7 +/- 0.6 nmol.l-1) and this peak coincided with maximum T concentrations (9.8-10.4 nmol.l-1). Elevated levels of T4 were found from late February until mid-April (31.0-33.6 nmol.l-1). Plasma T concentration was low at all stages of remex moult and regrowth. Decreased T4 levels were found in ganders during remex regrowth from the "brush" to half of the full primary growth stage. Higher plasma T4 levels were found before and after this stage of the moult. A reverse pattern was observed for T3 concentrations.

In response to overfeeding, geese develop fatty liver. To understand the fattening mechanism, mRNA differential display reverse transcription PCR was used to study the gene expression differences between French Landes grey geese and Xupu white geese in conditions of overfeeding and normal feeding. One gene was found to be up-regulated in the fatty liver in both breeds, and it has a 1797 bp cDNA with 83% identity to chicken SELENBP1. The sequence analysis revealed that its open reading frame of 1413 bp encodes a protein of 471 amino acids, which contains a putative conserved domain of 56 kDa selenium binding protein with high homology to its homologues of chicken (95%), rat (86%), mouse (84%), human (86%), monkey (86%), dog (86%), and cattle (86%). The function of this protein has been briefly reviewed based on published information. In tissue expression analysis, the expression of geese SELENBP1 mRNA was found to be higher in liver or kidney than in other tested tissues. The results showed that overfeeding could increase the mRNA expression level of geese SELENBP1.

Managers need to predict how animals will respond to habitat redistributions caused by climate change. Our objective was to model the effects of sea level rise on total eelgrass (Zostera marina) habitat area and on the amount of that area that is accessible to Brant geese (Branta bernicla), specialist grazers of eelgrass. Digital elevation models were developed for seven estuaries from Alaska, Washington, California (USA), and Mexico. Scenarios of future total eelgrass area were derived from combinations of estuarine specific sediment and tectonic rates (i.e., bottom change rate) with three rates of eustatic sea level rise (ESLR). Percentages of total eelgrass areas that were accessible to foraging Brant were determined for December when the birds overwinter at more southerly sites and in April as they move north to sites where they build body stores on their way to nesting areas in Alaska. The modeling showed that accessible eelgrass area could be lower than total area due to how daytime low-tide height, eelgrass shoot length, and the upper elevation of eelgrass determined Brant-reaching depth. Projections of future eelgrass area indicated that present-day ESLR (2.8 mm/yr) and bottom change rates should sustain the current pattern of estuarine use by Brant except in Morro Bay, where use should decrease because eelgrass is being ejected from this estuary by a positive bottom change rate. Higher ESLR rates (6.3 and 12.7 mm/yr) should result in less Brant use of estuaries at the northern and southern ends of the flyway, particularly during the winter, but more use of mid-latitude estuaries. The capacity of mid-latitude estuaries to function as Brant feeding refugia, or for these estuaries and Izembek Lagoon to provide drift rather than attached leaves, is eventually limited by the decrease in total eelgrass area, which is a result of a light extinction affect on the eelgrass, or the habitat being pushed out of the estuary by positive tectonic rates. Management responses are limited to the increase or decrease of sediment supply and the relocation of levees to allow for upslope migration of eelgrass habitat.

Rapid climate warming is driving organisms to advance timing of reproduction with earlier springs, but the rate of advancement shows large variation, even among populations of the same species. In this study, we investigated how the rate of advancement in timing of reproduction with a warming climate varies for barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis) populations breeding at different latitudes in the Arctic. We hypothesized that populations breeding further North are generally more time constrained and, therefore, produce clutches earlier relative to the onset of spring than southern populations. Therefore, with increasing temperatures and a progressive relief of time constraint, we expected latitudinal differences to decrease. For the years 2000-2016, we determined the onset of spring from snow cover data derived from satellite images, and compiled data on egg laying date and reproductive performance in one low-Arctic and two high-Arctic sites. As expected, high-Arctic geese laid their eggs earlier relative to snowmelt than low-Arctic geese. Contrary to expectations, advancement in laying dates was similar in high- and low-Arctic colonies, at a rate of 27% of the advance in date of snowmelt. Although advancement of egg laying did not fully compensate for the advancement of snowmelt, geese laying eggs at intermediate dates in the low Arctic were the most successful breeders. In the high Arctic, however, early nesting geese were the most successful breeders, suggesting that high-Arctic geese have not advanced their laying dates sufficiently to earlier springs. This indicates that high-Arctic geese especially are vulnerable to negative effects of climate warming.

Rhea lysozyme was analyzed for its enzymatic properties both lytic and oligomer activities to reveal the structural and functional relationships of goose type lysozyme. Rhea lysozyme had the highest lytic activity at pH 6, followed by ostrich and goose at pH 5.5-6, whereas the optimum of cassowary was at pH 5. pH profile was correlated to the net charge of each molecule surface. On the other hand, the pH optimum for oligomer substrate was found to be pH 4, indicating the mechanism of rhea catalysis as a general acid. The time-course of the reaction was studied using beta-1,4-linked oligosaccharide of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) with a polymerization degree of n ((GlcNAc)n) (n=4, 5, and 6) as the substrate. This enzyme hydrolyzed (GlcNAc)6 in an endo-splitting manner, which produced (GlcNAc)3+(GlcNAc)3 predominating over that to (GlcNAc)2+ (GlcNAc)4. This indicates that the lysozyme hydrolyzed preferentially the third glycosidic linkage from the nonreducing end. Theoretical analysis has shown the highest rate constant value at 1.5 s-1 with (GlcNAc)6. This confirmed six substrate binding subsites as goose lysozyme (Honda, Y., and Fukamizo, T., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1388, 53-65 (1998)). The different binding free energy values for subsites B, C, F, and G from goose lysozyme might responsible for the amino acid substitutions, Asn122Ser and Phe123Met, located at the subsite B.

This was the first study to exhaustively characterize the prevalence of Escherichia coli sero-groups in any wildlife species. Faecal samples from Canada geese (Branta canadensis) were collected over a single year in Fort Collins, Colorado, USA. The overall prevalence for E. coli ranged from 2% during the coldest time of the year to 94% during the warmest months of the year. During the time of year when nonmigratory geese dominated the local goose population (March-July) the prevalence of enterotoxogenic (ETEC) forms of E. coli was 13.0%. The prevalence of enterohemorrhagic (EHEC) forms was 6.0%, while prevalence for enteroinvasive (EIEC) and enteroagglomerative (EAEC) forms was 4.6 and 1.3%, respectively, during the same period. We also examined all samples positive for E. coli for genes coding for virulence factors, including: SLT-I, SLT-II, eae, hly-A, K1, LT, STa, STb, CNF1, and CNF2. Three isolates were positive for human virulence factors, representing a 2% prevalence for faeces containing potential human toxins. Genes for STa were isolated from ETEC strains O-8 and O-167, while the gene for K1 was isolated from an O-8 (ETEC) serogroup. These data will prove useful in focusing attention on the risks that increasing populations of urban Canada geese pose to public health.

Geese have the strongest tendency toward broodiness among all poultry. The mechanisms initiating broodiness within the goose hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPGA) are still unclear. Here, we reported the transcriptome differences between laying and initial nesting within the HPGA tissues of geese. We constructed a unigene database based on HPGA tissues and identified 128,148 unigenes, 100% of which have been annotated. By using Digital Gene Expression (DGE) sequencing, we screened 19, 110, 289, and 211 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, stroma ovarii, and follicles, respectively, between laying and nesting geese. Expression changes of hypocretin (HCRT) and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) in the hypothalamus of nesting geese may cause appetite reduction, which is possibly the first step and a prerequisite to initiate broodiness. In addition to prolactin (PRL), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), genes including oxytocin-neurophysin (OXT), chordin-like protein 1 (CHRDL1) and growth hormone (GH), expressed in the pituitary gland, are new candidate molecules that may be involved in broodiness in geese. Heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) in the pituitary gland, the proto-oncogene c-Fos (FOS), heat shock protein 90-alpha (HSP90AA), and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) in the ovary that may consolidate and transduce signals regulating the HPGA during broodiness in geese.

After testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is the main hormone involved in aggressive behaviour in birds. While the role of DHEA has been verified for wintering territorial passerines, it has not been shown for gregarious species. In wintering geese species, both sexes present very low testosterone levels and aggression in a non-sexual context is not testosterone-related. Therefore, testosterone does not seem to be responsible for aggressive behaviour by geese during winter and the role of DHEA must be explored. We used brent geese (Branta bernicla bernicla) to examine the roles of testosterone and DHEA in dominance relationships. For the first time, we highlighted the presence of plasma DHEA in free-living geese. As the level of DHEA was lower than that of testosterone, and there was no obvious impact of DHEA level on dominance status, our results failed to confirm the role of plasma DHEA in the social hierarchies of this species during winter. Nevertheless, because DHEA levels were greater in singletons than in paired birds, we discuss the need to explore hormonal and/or behavioural mechanisms implicated within dominance status acquisition and maintenance within each reproductive status class, to underline the role of the presence of relatives as a signal of dominance abilities. We also acknowledge and discuss the possibility that the long handling time may have affected DHEA levels and masked subtle differences between individuals.

1. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is involved in the control of prolactin (PRL) release and plays a pivotal role as a regulator of reproductive behaviour and neuroendocrine secretion in birds. 2. In this study, a 941-bp cDNA fragment covering the complete coding region (CDS) of goose VIP gene was identified. The cDNA contains a 32-bp 5'-untranslated region (UTR), a 603-bp CDS and a 306-bp 3'-UTR containing two ATTTA sequence elements, two polyadenylation signals (AATAAA) and a 25-bp poly (A) tail. 3. Seven exons and 6 introns were identified, and both the cDNA and genomic DNA sequences showed high identity with those of other species. 4. The sequence analysis indicated that there were two alternatively spliced transcripts the long transcript (VIP-1) encoded both VIP and peptide histidine isoleucine exons and the short one (VIP-2) only encoded VIP. 5. RT-PCR analysis indicates that the expression level of the VIP-1 is much lower than that of VIP-2, and that VIP-1 is negligible or absent in muscle, abdominal fat, ovary and spleen, whereas VIP-2 is widely distributed in all the examined tissues. 6. A total of 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including 2 SNPs located in the coding region and 10 variations in intron regions, were identified in goose VIP gene.

Recently, there have been several studies using open top chambers (OTCs) or cloches to examine the response of Arctic plant communities to artificially elevated temperatures. Few, however, have investigated multitrophic systems, or the effects of both temperature and vertebrate grazing treatments on invertebrates. This study investigated trophic interactions between an herbivorous insect (Sitobion calvulum, Aphididae), a woody perennial host plant (Salix polaris) and a selective vertebrate grazer (barnacle geese, Branta leucopsis). In a factorial experiment, the responses of the insect and its host to elevated temperatures using open top chambers (OTCs) and to three levels of goose grazing pressure were assessed over two summer growing seasons (2004 and 2005). OTCs significantly enhanced the leaf phenology of Salix in both years and there was a significant OTC by goose presence interaction in 2004. Salix leaf number was unaffected by treatments in both years, but OTCs increased leaf size and mass in 2005. Salix reproduction and the phenology of flowers were unaffected by both treatments. Aphid densities were increased by OTCs but unaffected by goose presence in both years. While goose presence had little effect on aphid density or host plant phenology in this system, the OTC effects provide interesting insights into the possibility of phenological synchrony disruption. The advanced phenology of Salix effectively lengthens the growing season for the plant, but despite a close association with leaf maturity, the population dynamics of the aphid appeared to lack a similar phenological response, except for the increased population observed.

In order to study the phylogenetic relationships among Coscoroba, goose, and swan lineages, sequences for the complete mitochondrial small ribosomal RNA (srRNA) gene were determined from five waterfowl species. Parsimony and distance analyses support the branching of Coscoroba prior to the divergence of geese and swans, and maximum likelihood analyses give almost equal support to that pattern and to the sister group relationship between Coscoroba and swans. The monophyly of the geese was confirmed at a statistically significant level. In sequence comparisons among waterfowl, transitions increase linearly with transversions, and so we conclude that the lack of complete resolution of Coscoroba's position is not due to sequence saturation alone, but also reflects relatively close branching times.

Postmortem changes in proteins that have been implicated in affecting muscle integrity were examined in goose (GG) and duck (DG) gizzard smooth muscle stored at 5°C. GG and DG smooth muscles were sampled at 0, 1, 3 and 7 day of storage. The pH was approximately 7 in both GG and DG samples during postmortem storage. Casein zymograms showed that 0-day μ-calpain activity was higher (p<0.05) in GG than in DG samples. As postmortem time progressed, μ-calpain was activated and autolyzed more extensively in GG than in DG samples. However, μ/m-calpain remained relatively stable in both samples. Western blots indicated that postmortem desmin degradation was more rapid in GG than in DG samples. In contrast, α-actinin remained nearly unchanged in both samples. Therefore, our results suggest that μ-calpain has an important role in the postmortem proteolysis of gizzard smooth muscle.

Adults of the flea, Ceratophyllus vagabundus vagabundus , were present in the hundreds in nests of Ross's (Chen rossii) and lesser snow (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) geese in the Arctic goose colony at Karrak Lake, Nunavut, Canada. Ceratophyllus v. vagabundus had not been previously recorded in association with Ross's or snow geese. Large numbers of C. v. vagabundus adults and larvae were collected and a description of the larva is provided for the first time. On the basis of external characters, larvae were indistinguishable from those of a number of other Ceratophyllus spp. previously described from North America, i.e., Ceratophyllus idius, Ceratophyllus niger, and Ceratophyllus lari.

Balance experiments were performed on six normal young geese and on six geese with a ligated caecum. The ration consisted of 43.25% barley, 30% sugar beet slices, 20% cellulose, 1.4% maize germ oil, 3% mineral mixture, 1% concentrate of vitamins and growth factors, 1.25% urea and 0.1% lysine. Daily nitrogen balance was similar in the two groups (average 1051 mg in the controls and 1090 mg in the experimental birds). Crude protein digestibility was 82.4 +/- 1.1% in the controls and 84.9 +/- 1% in the experimental birds (a significant difference). The bacterial flora of the caecum seemed to have no effect on crude fibre breakdown. Digestibility was quite low, averaging 5.7% in controls and 4.6% in experimental birds. The proportion of urea discharged in excreta was 50% in controls and 55.7% in experimental birds. Blood urea veraged 21.7 mg/100 g in controls and 22.8 mg in experimental birds (insignificant difference).

Studies were conducted to establish the differences in yolk cholesterol concentrations in eggs from various avian species. Cholesterol was determined by a modification of the colorimetric procedure of Pearson et al. (1953). Species listed in increasing concentrations of cholesterol per gram of yolk, were guinea fowl, chicken, pheasant, quail, turkey, duck, goose, and dove with an overall range of 12.77 to 21.99 mg of cholesterol per gram of yolk. Significant differences in cholesterol concentrations also were found between domestic and wild genetic groups for turkeys and ducks. In a second study, eggs from 7 inbred lines of chickens showed significant differences in yolk cholesterol. The same general result was found in an analysis of eggs from 17 commercial test strains of chickens at two different ages. Yolk cholesterol tended to decrease as age of hen increased. These results confirm the possibility of genetically selecting for decreased yolk cholesterol if economic or other conditions warrant. The increased efforts required to decrease yolk cholesterol by this approach would undoubtedly be expensive.

Cells from a goose embryo were shown to release particle-associated RNA-directed DNA polymerase and RNase H activities that required the presence of Nonidet P-40 for detection. The particles were not infectious and did not have endogenous DNA synthesis. The goose particle DNA polymerase was related to the DNA polymerase of spleen necrosis virus with respect to size and was inhibited by immunoglobulin G to spleen necrosis virus DNA polymerase. However, goose cells producing DNA polymerase-containing particles did not contain reticuloendotheliosis virus-related nucleotide sequences in their DNA.

The wide geographic spread of Eurasian Goose/Guangdong lineage highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) clade 2.3.4.4 viruses by wild birds is of great concern. In December 2014, an H5N8 HPAI clade 2.3.4.4 Group A (2.3.4.4A) virus was introduced to North America. Long-distance migratory wild aquatic birds between East Asia and North America, such as Northern Pintail (Anas acuta), were strongly suspected of being a source of intercontinental transmission. In this study, we evaluated the pathogenicity, infectivity and transmissibility of an H5N8 HPAI clade 2.3.4.4A virus in Northern Pintails and compared the results to that of an H5N1 HPAI clade 2.3.2.1 virus. All of Northern Pintails infected with either H5N1 or H5N8 virus lacked clinical signs and mortality, but the H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4 virus was more efficient at replicating within and transmitting between Northern Pintails than the H5N1 clade 2.3.2.1 virus. The H5N8-infected birds shed high titre of viruses from oropharynx and cloaca, which in the field supported virus transmission and spread. This study highlights the role of wild waterfowl in the intercontinental spread of some HPAI viruses. Migratory aquatic birds should be carefully monitored for the early detection of H5 clade 2.3.4.4 and other HPAI viruses.

Feather production is realised by gathering feathers from geese right as they start their natural moulting. The adequate gathering time coincides with the time of moulting. There is still scarce information as to whether or not gathering causes distress and pain to geese. A series of experiments was carried out by our research group to determine the effect of gathering on plasma corticosterone level in growing geese. In the present experiment, the reactions of five groups (two gathered and three not gathered groups) of 9-week-old Babat Hungarian Upgraded geese were compared regarding gathering. Blood samples were taken right before, during and 5 min, 1 and 3 h after gathering into heparinised tubes from all groups. The plasma concentration of corticosterone was determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA). The results show that the plasma concentration of corticosterone is high in the first sample of all groups but is significantly lower at subsequent blood samplings compared to the first samples, especially in gathered geese. Compared to the first sampling, we observed higher corticosterone levels in samples collected 1 and 3 h after gathering. This was true only for groups which were not gathered, especially for the group which was not given any antistress material. From these results it can be concluded that the handling of geese causes an elevation in plasma corticosterone level and that feather gathering does not result in a higher corticosterone level than the handling or catching of the bird. Therefore, it can be concluded that feather gathering - especially when it is done adequately in time - does not cause more distress than the handling or catching of the bird.

Melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 (MDA5) is an important cytoplasmic receptor that recognizes long molecules of viral double-stranded RNA and single-stranded RNA with 5' triphosphate and mediates type I interferon secretion. In this study, the full-length MDA5 gene in the goose was identified and characterized. The cDNA of goose MDA5 was 3,306 bp in length with an open reading frame of 3,018 bp, which encoded a polypeptide of 1,005 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence contained 6 main structure domains including 2 caspase activation and recruitment domains, one DExD/H-box helicase domain, one type III restriction enzyme domain, one helicase conserved C-terminal domain, and one RIG-I C-terminal domain. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that goose MDA5 mRNA was constitutively expressed in all sampled tissues. It was highly expressed in the jejunum, trachea, ileum, colon, and kidney, and lowly expressed in the muscular stomach, glandular stomach, and muscle. A significant increase in the transcription of MDA5 was detected in the brain, spleen, and lungs of geese after infection with H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus compared with uninfected tissues. These findings indicated that goose MDA5 was an important receptor, involved in the antiviral innate immune defense to H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in geese.

Muscovy duck parvovirus (MDPV) and goose parvovirus (GPV) have both been found to cause high mortality and morbidity in Muscovy ducklings. Specific detection is often rife with false positives due to high identity at the genomic nucleotide level and antigenic similarity between MDPVs and GPVs. In this study, significantly variable regions were found, via non-structural (NS) comparison, between MDPV and GPV NS genes; however, NS genes were conserved within the MDPV and GPV groups. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for detecting and differentiating MDPVs and GPVs was developed with more specificity based on the NS gene characterization. The assay detected as low as 103 DNA copies of both the MDPV and GPV strains, along with 549 separate base pairs (bp). No bands of the same size from other duck pathogens, including duck circovirus, duck enteritis virus, egg drop syndrome virus, duck-origin goose hemorrhagic polyomavirus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Riemerella anatipestifer and Pasteurella multocida were amplified. This indicates that this method for performing PCR provides a useful and reliable alternative tool for more precise differentiation of MDPV and GPV infection in clinical samples.

A novel gene encoding the α-chain of goose immunoglobulin heavy-chain (Igα) was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR. The cDNA had 1,760 bp and encompassed a partial V-D-J region of the heavy chain, a constant region (Cα) and 3'-untranslated region of α-chain. The Cα gene contains four constant region domains (CH1-CH4). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that goose IgCα has a close genetic relationship with duck, ostrich and chicken IgCα. Three-dimensional modeling and glycosylation analysis revealed the goose Igα is consistent with the characterization of immunoglobulin. Western blotting suggested the goose IgCα has the same antigenicity to natural IgA. In general, the identification of goose immunoglobulin not only provides insights into the evolution of the Ig heavy-chain gene family, but may also benefit future studies of the avian immune system.

To obtain a deletion mutant of Muscovy duck-origin goose parvovirus (MDGPV) and to analyze its biological characteristics, the pMDGPVPT plasmid, which contains a full-length DNA infectious clone of the MDGPV PT strain, was used in this study as the template. The E-box at nt 315 of the left inverted terminal repeat sequence (L-ITR) was deleted by overlap extension PCR to obtain the infectious recombinant plasmid p-PTΔE315. The p-PTΔE315 plasmid was transfected into 9-day-old non-immune Muscovy duck embryos via the yolk sac and the rescued deletion mutant virus r-PTΔE315 was generated. Experiments to demonstrate the novel deletion mutant virus' biological characteristics showed that r-PTΔE315 can cause typical lesions after infection of Muscovy duck embryos. Compared with its parent strain PT, the virulence of r-PTΔE315 and its proliferation ability in Muscovy duck embryos were attenuated, but its ability to replicate in MDEF cells was enhanced. This study laid the foundation for further understanding of the relationship between E-box deletion in the L-ITR and MDGPV virulence.

Infections with goose circovirus (GoCV) are associated with growth retardation and developmental problems in farmed geese. An indirect immunofluorescence assay for detecting virus-specific serum antibody was developed for diagnostic and epidemiological purposes. In the absence of a method for growing GoCV in cell culture, the assay was based on the reaction of antibodies with the GoCV capsid protein produced within baby hamster kidney cells using the eukaryotic Semliki forest virus expression vector. Using an optimized test that involved screening sera at 1:50 dilution and the use of a fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-duck immunoglobulin conjugate, GoCV-specific antibody was detected in 141 (88.6%) of 159 samples obtained from 27 of 28 breeder flocks aged from 1 to 6 years. Testing also showed the presence of GoCV-specific antibody in 85 (40.9%) of 208 serum samples from birds aged 30 weeks or less. Although maternally derived antibody was detected in birds when 1 and 4 days old, actively acquired antibody was first detected in birds aged 53 days. Following experimental inoculation of 21-day-old geese with tissue homogenate containing GoCV, virus-specific antibody was detected in serum samples collected at 27 and 34 days post inoculation. It is concluded that the SFV expression vector approach may prove useful for developing serological tests for other viruses, including other avian circoviruses, that do not grow in cell culture.

All long-distance migrants must cope with changing environments, but species differ greatly in how they do so. In some species, individuals might be able to adjust by learning from individual experiences and by copying others. This could greatly speed up the process of adjustment, but evidence from the wild is scarce. Here, we investigated the processes by which a rapidly growing population of barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) responded to strong environmental changes on spring-staging areas in Norway. One area, Helgeland, has been the traditional site. Since the mid-1990s, an increasing number of geese stage in another area 250 km further north, Vesterålen. We collected data on goose numbers and weather conditions from 1975 to 2017 to explore the extent to which the increase in population size and a warmer climate contributed to this change in staging area use. During the study period, the estimated onset of grass growth advanced on average by 0.54 days/year in each of the two areas. The total production of digestible biomass for barnacle geese during the staging period increased in Vesterålen but remained stable in Helgeland. The goose population has doubled in size during the past 25 years, with most of the growth being accommodated in Vesterålen. The observations suggest that this dramatic increase would not have happened without higher temperatures in Vesterålen. Records of individually marked geese indicate that from the initial years of colonization onwards, especially young geese tended to switch to Vesterålen, thereby predominating in the flocks at Vesterålen. Older birds had a lower probability of switching to Vesterålen, but over the years, the probability increased for all ages. Our findings suggest that barnacle geese integrate socially learned behaviour with adjustments to individual experiences, allowing the population to respond rapidly and accurately to global change.

The unusually high quality of census data for large waterbirds in Europe facilitates the study of how population change varies across a broad geographical range and relates to global change. The wintering population of the greylag goose Anser anser in the Atlantic flyway spanning between Sweden and Spain has increased from 120 000 to 610 000 individuals over the past three decades, and expanded its wintering range northwards. Although population sizes recorded in January have increased in all seven countries in the wintering range, we found a pronounced northwards latitudinal effect in which the rate of increase is higher at greater latitudes, causing a constant shift in the centre of gravity for the spatial distribution of wintering geese. Local winter temperatures have a strong influence on goose numbers but in a manner that is also dependent on latitude, with the partial effect of temperature (while controlling for the increasing population trend between years) being negative at the south end and positive at the north end of the flyway. Contrary to assumptions in the literature, the expansion of crops exploited by greylag geese has made little contribution to the increases in population size. Only in one case (expansion of winter cereals in Denmark) did we find evidence of an effect of changing land use. The expanding and shifting greylag population is likely to have increasing impacts on habitats in northern Europe during the course of this century.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Bacillus subtilis var. natto N21 (BAC) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y10 (SAC) fermented liquid feed (FLF) during different incubation times on the growth performance, relative organ weight, intestinal microflora, and organ antioxidative status in Landes geese. Two hundred forty male Landes geese (10 wk old) with the BW of 4.163 ± 0.108 kg were selected for a 3-wk trial and randomly allotted to 3 treatments according to their BW (10 replicates/treatment and 8 geese/replicate). The treatments included 1) CON, dry basal feed (corn-soybean basal diet mixed with water) before feeding (2:1 wt/wt), 2) FLF24, 24 h FLF, and 3) FLF48, 48 h FLF. The FLF diet was prepared by storing basal diet with 10(9) cfu/g feed of each BAC and SAC and water (2:1 wt/wt) in a closed tank at 20°C fermented for 24 or 48 h. The BW gain and feed intake of geese fed FLF24 and FLF48 was greater (P < 0.05) than CON treatment. Feeding geese with FLF24 and FLF48 feeds increased (P < 0.05) the relative weight of leg muscle whereas the liver was heavier (P < 0.05) in FLF48 treatment than CON and FLF24 treatments. The FLF24 and FLF48 increased (P < 0.05) the Lactobacillus population and depressed (P < 0.05) Escherichia coli population in small and large intestine. The high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration was greatest (P < 0.05) in FLF48 whereas the total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was less (P < 0.05) in FLF24 and FLF48 treatments than CON. Geese fed FLF48 diet had greater glutathione peroxidase activity and less malondialdehyde content in heart and liver than those fed CON diet. In breast muscle, the superoxide dismutase activity were increased (P < 0.05) by FLF24 and FLF48 treatments than CON diet. In conclusion, the results indicated that feeding geese with BAC and SAC mix FLF can improve growth and feed intake, modulate the intestine ecology, and decrease the blood cholesterol concentrations; it also can improve the antioxidative status of organs and breast muscle.

The present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary protein and energy levels on digestive enzymes and electrolyte composition in jejunum of geese. A 3×3 factorial and completely randomized design was adopted with three protein levels and three energy levels. The experiment included four replicates for each treatment, and three geese for each replicate. Isovolumetric supernate from centrifugal jejuna fluid were mixed in each replicate. Activities of digestive enzymes and ions were analyzed. The results showed trypsin and chymotrypsin activities were significantly increased with increasing of dietary protein and energy levels (P<0.05). The concentrations of Ca2+ and pH value were significantly decreased by increased dietary protein and energy levels. However, no significant differences were found for the activities of amylase and cellulase, as well as the concentration of Na+ among groups with different protein and energy levels. In conclusion, digesta enzymes and electrolytes in the small intestine adapted to the protein and energy levels. The activities of protease, rather than amylase and cellulase were induced with increasing of protein and energy levels. The imbalance of positive and negative ions was possibly adjusted by the fluctuant concentrations of K+ , Cl- and Ca2+ for maintaining normal physiological function.

A real-time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) method has been developed for the quantitation of mule duck (Anas platyrhynchos x Cairina moschata) in binary duck/goose foie gras mixtures. The method combines the use of real-time PCR with duck-specific and endogenous control "duck + goose" primers to measure duck content and total foie gras content, respectively. Both PCR systems (duck-specific and duck + goose) were designed on the mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA gene (rRNA). The duck-specific system amplifies a 96 bp fragment from duck DNA, whereas the duck + goose system amplifies a 120 bp fragment from duck and goose DNA. The method measures PCR product accumulation through a FAM-labeled fluorogenic probe (TaqMan). The C(t) (threshold cycle) values obtained from the duck + goose system are used to normalize the ones obtained from the duck-specific system. Analysis of experimental duck/goose foie gras binary mixtures demonstrated the suitability of the assay for the detection and quantitation of duck in the range of 1-25%. This genetic marker can be very useful to avoid mislabeling or fraudulent species substitution of goose by duck in foie gras.

Wetlands are significant sources of atmospheric methane. Methane produced by microbes enters roots and escapes to the atmosphere through the shoots of emergent wetland plants. Herbivorous birds graze on helophytes, but their effect on methane emission remains unknown. We hypothesized that grazing on shoots of wetland plants can modulate methane emission from wetlands. Diffusive methane emission was monitored inside and outside bird exclosures, using static flux chambers placed over whole vegetation and over single shoots. Both methods showed significantly higher methane release from grazed vegetation. Surface-based diffusive methane emission from grazed plots was up to five times higher compared to exclosures. The absence of an effect on methane-cycling microbial processes indicated that this modulating effect acts on the gas transport by the plants. Modulation of methane emission by animal-plant-microbe interactions deserves further attention considering the increasing bird populations and changes in wetland vegetation as a consequence of changing land use and climate change.

We determined the pulmonary pressor response during hypoxia in bar-headed geese (Anser indicus), a species that flies at altitudes up to 9,000 m, and Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos), a non-flyer. Mean pulmonary arterial blood pressure (PAP) and arterial O2 partial pressure (PaO2) were measured in unanesthetized birds acutely exposed to 21, 10, 5, and, in geese only, 4% O2. PAP in geese did not change as PaO2 was reduced from 95 to 46 Torr and rose only 3 mmHg when PaO2 was reduced to 28 Torr. The same PaO2 decline in ducks (99 to 29 Torr) resulted in an 11-mmHg rise in PAP. The data suggest that very little or no increase in pulmonary vascular resistance occurs in these geese during hypoxia. This bird may provide a unique model in which to study pulmonary vascular control mechanisms.

Theory predicts that parallel evolution should be common when the number of beneficial mutations is limited by selective constraints on protein structure. However, confirmation is scarce in natural populations. Here we studied the major haemoglobin genes of eight Andean duck lineages and compared them to 115 other waterfowl species, including the bar-headed goose (Anser indicus) and Abyssinian blue-winged goose (Cyanochen cyanopterus), two additional species living at high altitude. One to five amino acid replacements were significantly overrepresented or derived in each highland population, and parallel substitutions were more common than in simulated sequences evolved under a neutral model. Two substitutions evolved in parallel in the alpha A subunit of two (Ala-alpha 8) and five (Thr-alpha 77) taxa, and five identical beta A subunit substitutions were observed in two (Ser-beta 4, Glu-beta 94, Met-beta 133) or three (Ser-beta 13, Ser-beta 116) taxa. Substitutions at adjacent sites within the same functional protein region were also observed. Five such replacements were in exterior, solvent-accessible positions on the A helix and AB corner of the alpha A subunit. Five others were in close proximity to inositolpentaphosphate binding sites, and two pairs of independent replacements occurred at two different alpha(1)beta(1) intersubunit contacts. More than half of the substitutions in highland lineages resulted in the acquisition of serine or threonine (18 gains vs. 2 losses), both of which possess a hydroxyl group that can hydrogen bond to a variety of polar substrates. The patterns of parallel evolution observed in these waterfowl suggest that adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia has resulted from selection on unique but overlapping sets of one to five amino acid substitutions in each lineage.

The geese have strong broodiness and poor egg performance. These characteristics are the key issues that hinder the goose industry development. Yet little is known about the mechanisms responsible for follicle development due to lack of genomic resources. Hence, studies based on high-throughput sequencing technologies are needed to produce a comprehensive and integrated genomic resource and to better understand the biological mechanisms of goose follicle development.

While bar-headed geese are renowned for migration at high altitude over the Himalayas, previous work on captive birds suggested that these geese are unable to maintain rates of oxygen consumption while running in severely hypoxic conditions. To investigate this paradox, we re-examined the running performance and heart rates of bar-headed geese and barnacle geese (a low altitude species) during exercise in hypoxia. Bar-headed geese (n = 7) were able to run at maximum speeds (determined in normoxia) for 15 minutes in severe hypoxia (7% O2; simulating the hypoxia at 8500 m) with mean heart rates of 466±8 beats min-1. Barnacle geese (n = 10), on the other hand, were unable to complete similar trials in severe hypoxia and their mean heart rate (316 beats.min-1) was significantly lower than bar-headed geese. In bar-headed geese, partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in both arterial and mixed venous blood were significantly lower during hypoxia than normoxia, both at rest and while running. However, measurements of blood lactate in bar-headed geese suggested that anaerobic metabolism was not a major energy source during running in hypoxia. We combined these data with values taken from the literature to estimate (i) oxygen supply, using the Fick equation and (ii) oxygen demand using aerodynamic theory for bar-headed geese flying aerobically, and under their own power, at altitude. This analysis predicts that the maximum altitude at which geese can transport enough oxygen to fly without environmental assistance ranges from 6,800 m to 8,900 m altitude, depending on the parameters used in the model but that such flights should be rare.

On the base of obtaining the full length genome sequence of a Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolated from goose, the minigenome was constructed by replacing all the encoding region with the reporter gene of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), except the virus regulating sequences relating to replication, transcription and packing of virus genome. The reporter gene could be expressed after it was transfected into the HEp-2 cells infected with helper virus of NDV. This result indicated that the minigenome could be translated by the NDV NP, P and L proteins provided by helper virus. Furthermore, the support plasmids expressing NDV NP, P and L protein were constructed respectively and the function of these plasmids was identified using the minigenome. Additionally, the virus rescue system was optimized by changing the infection dose of the recombinant vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase. The work mentioned above will accelerate greatly the rescue of NDV and other relative research.

Melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) plays a crucial part in regulating feeding behavior in humans and rodents. We detected two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; c.108G → A and c.627C → T) in the goose MC4R gene and genotyped 94 Landes geese for association analysis with several carcass traits. Significant associations (P < 0.05) were obtained for c.108G → A with carcass weight, breast muscle percentage, and leg muscle percentage, and for c.627C → T with body weight, carcass weight, semi-eviscerated weight, and eviscerated weight. We re-constructed haplotypes based on the two SNPs and analyzed diplotypes in association with carcass traits, obtaining significant associations with several of the traits. These results suggest that polymorphisms in the MC4R gene could have effects on carcass traits in Landes geese. More study is required to confirm these results.

Antizyme inhibitor 1 (Azin1) plays critical roles in various cellular pathways, including ornithine decarboxylase regulation, polyamine anabolism and uptake and cell proliferation. However, the molecular characteristics of the AZIN1 gene and its expression profile in goose tissues and ovarian follicles have not been reported. In this study, the AZIN1 cDNA of the Sichuan white goose (Anser cygnoides) was cloned, and analyzed for its phylogenetic and physiochemical properties. The expression profile of AZIN1 mRNA in geese tissues and ovarian follicles were examined using quantitative real-time PCR. The results showed that the open reading frame of the AZIN1 cDNA is 1,353 bp in length, encoding a 450 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 50 kDa. Out of all tissues examined, AZIN1 expression was highest in the adrenal gland and lowest in breast muscle. There was also a high expression of AZIN1 in the cerebellum and isthmus of oviduct. With follicular development, AZIN1 gene expression gradually increased, and its expression in F1 was significantly higher than in F5 (P<0.05). AZIN1 expression was also significantly higher in the POF1 than in the other follicles (P<0.05), and there was a low mRNA expression of AZIN1 in atretic follicles. The results of AZIN1 expression profiling in ovarian follicles suggest that AZIN1 may play an important role in the progression of follicular development, potentially through regulating polyamine levels.

Duck and goose fibrinogen were isolated from fresh pooled plasma by three different methods. To minimize proteolytic activity, epsilon-aminocaproic acid and trasylol were used throughout the preparation procedures. Amino acid composition of fibrinogens and carbohydrate content (hexose, hexosamine, sialic acid) as well as phosphorus were analysed. Intact preparations showed single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After reduction and modification of the thiol groups, the material could be separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis into four bands corresponding to the gamma, partially degraded A alpha, B beta and intact A alpha chain. Intact polypeptide subunits were separated by ion-exchange chromatography or preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and their amino acid compositions were determined. Evidences supporting the view that bird fibrinogen is very sensitive to proteolytic degradation and that a partial degradation of the A alpha chain takes place even when inhibitors are used in all steps of the purification procedures are presented.

Expanding populations of North American midcontinent lesser snow geese (Anser caerulescens caerulescens) have potential to alter ecosystems throughout the Arctic and subarctic where they breed. Efforts to understand origins of harvested lesser snow geese to better inform management decisions have traditionally required mark-recapture approaches, while aerial photographic surveys have typically been used to identify breeding distributions. As a potential alternative, isotopic patterns that are metabolically fixed within newly grown flight feathers following summer molting could provide inferences regarding geographic breeding origin of individuals, without the need for prior capture. Our objective was to assess potential to use four stable isotopes (δ13C, δ15N, δ34S, δ2H) from feather material to determine breeding origins. We obtained newly grown flight feathers from individuals during summer banding at three Arctic and two subarctic breeding colonies in 2014 (n = 56) and 2016 (n = 45). We used linear discriminant analyses to predict breeding origins from models using combinations of stable isotopes as predictors and evaluated model accuracy when predicting colony, subregion, or subpopulation levels. We found a strong inverse relationship between δ2H values and increasing latitude (R2 = 0.83), resulting in differences (F4, 51 = 90.41, P < 0.0001) among sampled colonies. No differences in δ13C or δ15N were detected among colonies, although δ34S in Akimiski Island, Baffin Island, and Karrak Lake were more enriched (F4, 51 = 11.25, P < 0.0001). Using δ2H values as a predictor, discriminant analyses improved accuracy in classification level as precision decreased [model accuracy = 67% (colony), 88% (subregion), 94% (subpopulation)]. Application of the isotopic methods we describe could be used to provide an alternative monitoring method of population metrics, such as overall breeding population distribution, region-specific productivity and migratory connectivity that are informative to management decision makers and provide insight into cross-seasonal effects that may influence migratory behavior.

To investigate mechanisms that may allow birds to tolerate extreme high altitude (hypocapnic hypoxia), we examined the effects of severe hypocapnia and moderate hypercapnia on regional blood flow in bar-headed geese (Anser indicus), a species that flies at altitudes up to 9,000 m. Cerebral, coronary, and pectoral muscle blood flows were measured using radioactive microspheres, while arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2) was varied from 7 to 62 Torr in awake normoxic birds. Arterial blood pressure was not affected by hypocapnia but increased slightly during hypercapnia. Heart rate did not change during alterations in PaCO2. Severe hypocapnia did not significantly alter cerebral, coronary, or pectoral muscle blood flow. Hypercapnia markedly increased cerebral and coronary blood flow, but pectoral muscle blood flow was unaffected. The lack of a blood flow reduction during severe hypocapnia may represent an important adaptation in these birds, enabling them to increase O2 delivery to the heart and brain at extreme altitude despite the presence of a very low PaCO2.

The Sichuan White goose is a Chinese breed well known for the quality of its meat. However, reproductive performance in this goose is not ideal, and little information is available regarding the abundance of transcripts. To better understand the molecular mechanism(s) underpinning prelaying and laying periods in the Sichuan white goose, high-throughput RNA sequencing was performed to analyze the transcriptome in the hypothalamus. After sequencing and annotation, 26,921 unigenes were obtained, with 48 transcripts up-regulated in the prelaying period and 180 transcripts up-regulated during the laying period. These transcripts were primarily related to diseases, cancers, signaling molecules and interactions, the nervous system and the immune system. Eight transcripts were selected for further analyses with quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The qRT-PCR results were mostly consistent with those from the high-throughput RNA sequencing. Among these transcripts, serine/threonine-protein kinase (AMPK), heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and NADH dehydrogenase 1 (ND1) were differentially expressed during the prelaying and laying periods. The results of this study provide a useful resource for future studies examining the hypothalamus in geese.

Immunoglobulins play an important role in adaptive immune system as defense molecules against pathogens. However, our knowledge on avian immunoglobulin genes has been limited to a few species. In this study, we analyzed goose (Anser cygnoides orientalis) immunoglobulin genes. Three IgH classes including IgM, IgA, IgY and λ light chain were identified. The IgM and IgA heavy chain constant regions are characteristically similar to their counterparts described in other vertebrates. In addition to the classic Ig isotypes, we also detected a transcript that encoded a truncated form of IgY (IgY(ΔFc)) in goose. Similar to duck, the IgY(ΔFc) in goose was generated by using different transcriptional termination signal of the same υ gene. Limited variability and only one leader peptide were observed in VH and VL domains, which suggested that gene conversion was the primary mechanism involved in goose antibody diversity. Our study provides more insights into the immunoglobulin genes in goose that had not been fully explored before.

The reliability of noninvasively measuring steroid hormones from feces in greylag geese (Anser anser) and domestic geese (A. domesticus), both qualitatively and quantitatively, was tested experimentally. Geese are mainly herbivorous birds with a short gut-passage time (2-3 h). Groups of eight outdoor-housed male domestic geese were subjected to two different experiments, injection of either GnRH or ACTH, which were replicated in three different seasons (spring, summer, and fall). GnRH stimulation resulted in significant increases of response fecal testosterone metabolites (TM; 17beta-OH-androgens) in spring and fall, but not during the summer photorefractoriness. Testosterone response patterns obtained from plasma samples paralleled those from feces; however, no direct correlation between individual immunoreactive plasma and feces contents was observed. To improve the sample handling during extraction and the assay sensitivity, we promote the use of a group-specific antibody against 17-oxoandrogens that does not require deconjugation prior to the analysis. ACTH robustly increased fecal corticosterone in all seasons. The polar nature of glucocorticoids, however, seems to make a distinction between conjugated and nonconjugated types difficult, and the available avian literature on this topic is discussed.

We report on life history characteristics, temporal, and age-related effects influencing the frequency of occurrence of avian influenza (AI) viruses in four species of migratory geese breeding on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska. Emperor geese (Chen canagica), cackling geese (Branta hutchinsii), greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons), and black brant (Branta bernicla), were all tested for active infection of AI viruses upon arrival in early May, during nesting in June, and while molting in July and August, 2006-2010 (n = 14,323). Additionally, prior exposure to AI viruses was assessed via prevalence of antibodies from sera samples collected during late summer in 2009 and 2010. Results suggest that geese are uncommonly infected by low pathogenic AI viruses while in Alaska. The percent of birds actively shedding AI viruses varied annually, and was highest in 2006 and 2010 (1-3%) and lowest in 2007, 2008, and 2009 (<0.70%). Contrary to findings in ducks, the highest incidence of infected birds was in late spring when birds first arrived from staging and wintering areas. Despite low prevalence, most geese were previously exposed to AI viruses, as indicated by high levels of seroprevalence during late summer (47%-96% across species; n = 541). Seroprevalence was >95% for emperor geese, a species that spends part of its life cycle in Asia and is endemic to Alaska and the Bering Sea region, compared to 40-60% for the other three species, whose entire life cycles are within the western hemisphere. Birds <45 days of age showed little past exposure to AI viruses, although antibodies were detected in samples from 5-week old birds in 2009. Seroprevalence of known age black brant revealed that no birds <4 years old had seroconverted, compared to 49% of birds ≥4 years of age.

Up to half the world's population of bar-headed geese (Anser indicus) migrate between central Asia and India and fly between 5000 m and 9000 m above sea level as they cross the Himalayas. The partial pressures of oxygen at these altitudes are, respectively, about 50% and 30% those at sea level. Flapping flight is energetically expensive, so how are bar-headed geese able to migrate at such altitudes? The haemoglobin of bar-headed geese has a greater affinity for oxygen than those of lowland birds, and birds are able to hyperventilate to a greater extent than mammals during severe hypoxia. Together, these mean that the concentration of oxygen in the arterial blood at a given altitude is greater in bar-headed geese than in lowland birds and mammals. The low partial pressure of CO(2) in arterial blood (hypocapnia) that accompanies hyperventilation does not cause reduction of cerebral blood flow in birds as it does in mammals, thus there is greater oxygen delivery to the brain in hypoxic birds, including bar-headed geese, than in mammals. Captive bar headed geese could not maintain elevated aerobic metabolism during exercise at a simulated altitude of 8500 m and their cardiac stroke volume was much lower than that during exercise at sea level. This suggests that if some individuals of this species of geese do really manage to fly over Mt Everest, they may only do so if they receive assistance from vertical air movements, for example from lee waves downwind from the mountains.

Genetic analysis of viral HA gene showed that there were 22 nucleotide differences in HA gene between goose and human H5N1 viruses. The sequence analysis of amino acid on viral protein molecules indicated that there were 7 and 9 position differences between goose and human, chicken H5N1 viruses, respectively. All the three viruses share multiple basic amino acids (R-E-R-R-R-K-K-R) at the cleavage site between HA1 and HA2 domain, that is associated with highly pathogenic H5 avian viruses. Except one more glycosylation site located at 156 position in the chicken strain, there were 7 glycosylation sites at same positions in three virus HA protein molecules. The analysis of NA protein molecule indicated that the stalk region which extends from the viral membrane up to amino acid 85, human and chicken viruses had a 19 amino-acid deletion as compared with that of goose virus, while the goose NA gene was closely related to A/Parrot/Ulster/73 (H7N1) virus. Therefore, goose H5N1 virus HA and NA genes were avian in origin and were different from those of human and chicken H5N1 viruses. In our knowledge, this is the first time that the avian H5N1 virus was found causing influenza outbreak in goose. Why was A/Goose/Guangdong/2/96(H5N1) virus virulent for geese? It might be related to the substitution of amino acid located at 138 position near by RBS on HA protein molecule and 19 amino acids insertion on NA protein molecule as compared with those of human and chicken H5N1 viruses.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs plays a critical role in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. Broodiness is observed in most avian species and influences egg production. Several genes are known to play an important role in regulating the progress of reproduction. The goose is one of the most important waterfowls. However, the involvement of miRNAs in the broodiness behavior of Anser cygnoides (Swan Goose) is unknown. High-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis were used to identify the miRNAs involved in egg-laying and brooding behavior of geese in our study. The results showed 38 up-regulated and 14 down-regulated known miRNAs/miRNA*s with reads>1,000 in at least one group and a fold change of >2.0, compared with those of the egg-laying group (P<0.001). We also identified 114 and 94 novel miRNAs in the broody and egg-laying groups, respectively. Of these, 4 novel miRNAs were differentially expressed between the two groups. The study showed the expression of small RNAs in goose reproduction and identified known and novel miRNAs regulated in broodiness. The results reveal that these differentially expressed miRNAs may be involved in broodiness of A. cygnoides.

Experiments were conducted to test the hypothesis that halothane anesthesia functionally disrupts CO2-sensitive intrapulmonary chemoreceptors (IPC) in birds. Halothane effects on ventilatory reflexes elicited by changes in lung CO2 without extrapulmonary halothane or CO2 effects were studied in 6 anesthetized (pentobarbital, 30 mg/kg) and unidirectionally ventilated geese. Each lung was independently ventilated. Halothane was added only to gases ventilating the left lung. The left pulmonary artery was occluded to prevent changes in PCO2 or halothane concentration within the left lung from affecting arterial blood. The right lung allowed control of arterial blood gases and was vagally denervated. Left lung CO2 reflexes were observed at different levels of halothane concentration between 0 and 2% while arterial PCO2 and PO2 were held constant. Higher levels of chemical drive were necessary to initiate ventilatory movements in geese (PACO2 = 40-60 mmHg) relative to previous reports on chickens using similar experimental procedures (PaCO2 less than or equal to 30 mmHg). The amplitude of sternal movements or respiratory amplitude (RA) increased as left lung PCO2 increased from 6 to 55 mmHg, and then reached a plateau. Adding halothane (1 or 2%) to the left lung increased RA through a limited range of PCO2, but had no effect on its maximum value. Neither CO2 nor halothane in the left lung had any effect on respiratory frequency. We conclude that halothane impairs lung CO2 reflexes largely due to its effects on IPC since intrapulmonary halothane augments ventilatory activity at low, but not high intrapulmonary PCO2. Effects of halothane on IPC may play a role in the unique ventilatory effects of halothane anesthesia in intact, spontaneously breathing birds relative to mammals at equipotent anesthetic levels.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of hypocapnic hypoxia on regional blood flow in birds. Regional blood flow was measured using the radioactive microsphere method in unanesthetized Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and bar-headed geese (Anser indicus) breathing 21, 10 and 5% O2. In both birds, arterial PO2 was reduced from about 96 Torr during normoxia to about 28 Torr during severe hypoxia. Severe hypocapnic hypoxia produced a change in the pattern of blood flow in ducks; blood flow to some organs increased (brain, adrenal glands, heart, and eyes) while flow to other organs decreased (liver, spleen, small intestine, shell gland). Compared with ducks, bar-headed geese were able to provide higher levels of O2 delivery to their tissues since blood flow to a variety of organs and skeletal muscles was either unchanged or increased during severe hypoxia. The redistribution of blood flow in Pekin ducks during severe hypocapnic hypoxia may help to support large increases in cerebral and coronary blood flow but may also contribute to the development of a metabolic acidosis.

The ultrastructure of goose intestinal epithelial cells infected with various stages of E. kotlani has been described. No changes in the ultrastructure of the nucleus and cytoplasm were detected in cells, containing asexual stages. Damage of host cell structures, except Golgi complex, was not observed until gamogenesis. It is suggested that these changes are caused by the intensive "exploitation" of differentiated epithelial cells by large coccidian stages (macro- and microgametocytes). It is concluded that the epithelial cell of the goose, as of other animals, may function beyond crypts without the regulating influence of the nucleus.

Staphylococcus aureus can colonize a range of species. Although numerous studies have isolated pathogenic bacteria from wild birds, very little is known regarding S. aureus and their potential to spread methicillin-resistant (MRSA) strains. The objective of this study was to determine the presence and molecular characteristics of S. aureus in geese fecal samples collected from ten state parks across Northeast Ohio (NEO). A total of 182 fecal samples from Canada geese (Branta canadensis) were collected in April 2015. Isolates were characterized using multi-locus sequence (MLST) and spa typing, as well as PCR to detect the presence of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), mecA, and scn genes. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was done via Vitek-2 system. The overall contamination by S. aureus in fecal samples was 7.1% (13/182); 7/182 (3.8%) were MRSA and 6/182 (3.3%) were methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA). One isolate was positive for PVL. A total of eight different spa types were observed. MLST included ST5, ST8, ST291, ST298, and ST2111. One (7.7%) MSSA isolate was multi-drug resistant. The S. aureus contamination in NEO state parks ranged from 0% (park 1, 4, 8, 9) to 35% (7/20) (park 5). Parks 2, 3, 6, and 7 had 5% (1/20) positive. The results of this study indicate that the feces of geese collected at various state parks in NEO may harbor S. aureus.

To understand the genetic variations between the field strains of waterfowl parvoviruses and their attenuated derivatives, we analyzed the complete nucleotide sequences of the viral protein 1 (VP1) genes of nine field strains and two vaccine strains of waterfowl parvoviruses. Sequence comparison of the VP1 proteins showed that these viruses could be divided into goose parvovirus (GPV) related and Muscovy duck parvovirus (MDPV) related groups. The amino acid difference between GPV- and MDPV-related groups ranged from 13.1% to 15.8%, and the most variable region resided in the N terminus of VP2. The vaccine strains of GPV and MDPV exhibited only 1.2% and 0.3% difference in amino acid when compared with their parental field strains, and most of these differences resided in residues 497-575 of VP1, suggesting that these residues might be important for the attenuation of GPV and MDPV. When the GPV strains isolated in 1982 (the strain 82-0308) and in 2001 (the strain 01-1001) were compared, only 0.3% difference in amino acid was found, while MDPV strains isolated in 1990 (the strain 90-0219) and 1997 (the strain 97-0104) showed only 0.4% difference in amino acid. The result indicates that the genome of waterfowl parvovirus had remained highly stable in the field.

An blood/membrane apparatus was used to study the feeding responses of field-collected and lab-reared Simulium vittatum and Prosimulium mixtum. Both species showed preferences for human, horse, cow and pig bloods while neither fed in high rates on dog or goose bloods. These results are discussed in the context of field data on host preferences. Size was shown to be related to the feeding rates in S. vittatum, larger flies feeding more readily. Lab-reared S. vittatum females fed in decreasing rates over 1-8 days after emergence. This is believed to be related to the autogenous maturation of the ovaries in this species.

Goose haemorrhagic polyomavirus (GHPV) provoke haemorrhagic nephritis and enteritis of domestic geese. Outbreaks were detected in European countries and caused economic losses for goose keepers. Domestic ducks may be infected with GHPV without any signs typical for geese. The genomic organisation of some isolates was described but the gene functions and the pathomechanisms of the virus was not precisely defined. Here we describe the genome sequence and structure of GHPV of a goose from a Hungarian goose flock showing characteristics of the haemorrhagic nephritis and enteritis. The GHPV genome investigated in this study was 5252 bp long and was very similar (99% nucleotide identity) to sequences deposited in the GenBank. All the whole GHPV genomes possess the same ORFs in length, including the VP1, VP2, VP3, ORF-X, t and T tumour antigens. Amino acid changes are detected mainly in the putative ORF-X region. Data about the GHPV genome imply a conserved genomic structure among isolates from different countries. Genomic and epidemiological studies may help vaccine development efforts and identify potential heterologous reservoirs of GHPV.

Goose parvovirus (GPV) and avian influenza virus subtype H9N2 are single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses, respectively, both of which can spread in goslings and cause a significant economic loss. To explore the comprehensive transcriptome of GPV- or H9N2-infected goose spleens and to understand the immune responses induced by a DNA virus (GPV) or a RNA virus (H9N2), RNA-seq was performed on the spleens of goslings at the fifth day post infection. In the present study, 2604 and 2409 differentially expressed unigenes were identified in the GPV- and H9N2-infected groups, respectively. Through KEGG pathway enrichment analyses, the up-regulated transcripts in the two virus-infected groups were mainly involved in immune-related pathways. In addition, the two virus-infected groups displayed similar expression patterns in the immune response pathways, including pattern-recognition receptor signaling pathways, the antigen processing and presentation pathway, the NF-κB signaling pathway and the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, as well as cytokines. Furthermore, most of the immune-related genes, particularly TLR7, TRAF3, Mx, TRIM25, CD4, and CD8α, increased in response to GPV and H9N2 infection. However, the depression of NF-κB signaling may be a mechanism by which the viruses evade the host immune system or a strategy to achieve immune homeostasis.

Based on the complete genome sequence of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) ZJI strain isolated from an outbreak in the goose, seven pairs of primers were designed to amplify cDNA fragment for constructing the plasmid pNDV/ZJI, which contained the full-length cDNA of NDV ZJI strain. The pNDV/ZJI with three helper plasmids, pCI-NP, pCI-P and pCI-L, were then cotransfected into BSR-T7/5 cells expressing T7 RNA polymerase. After inoculation of the transfected cell culture supernatant into embryonated chicken eggs from specific-pathogen-free (SPF) flock, infectious NDV ZJI strain was successfully rescued. The recombinant plasmid pNDV/ZJIFM was generated by converting the multi-basic amino acid sequence of the F0 protein cleavage region in pNDV/ZJI to the non-basic amino acid sequence characteristic of avirulent NDV strain. After cotransfection of the resultant plasmid and the three helper plasmids into BSR-T7/5 cells, the recombinant NDV, NDV/ZJIFM, was generated. The mean death time (MDT) of NDV/ZJIFM was more than 120h and the intrancerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) was 0.16, indicating that the rescued virus was highly attenuated. This attenuated genotype VIId NDV of goose origin could be a desirable vaccine in controlling the current epidemic of ND.

The transcription factors GATA-4 and GATA-6, members of the GATA family, play an important role in ovarian cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. In this study, the full-length coding sequences of goose GATA-4 and GATA-6 were cloned and characterized. GATA-4 and GATA-6 consist of 1236 and 1104 nucleotides encoding proteins with 411 and 367 amino acids, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequences of both proteins include two adjacent zinc finger domains with the distinctive form (CVNC-X17-CNAC)-X29-(CANC-X17-CNAC) and share 84.76% identity within this domain. In silico prediction together with matching of the high affinity RRXS(T)Y motif revealed that the GATA-4 protein might be phosphorylated predominantly at S(233), but no phosphorylation site was found in the GATA-6 protein. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis showed that GATA-4 and GATA-6 mRNAs were co-expressed in goose follicles, moderately expressed in granulosa cells and weakly expressed in theca cells. The expression level of GATA-4 mRNA in healthy follicles was significantly higher than in atretic follicles or postovulatory follicles (P<0.01), and the expression level of GATA-6 mRNA in healthy follicles was significantly lower than in atretic follicles or postovulatory follicles (P<0.01). The expression level of GATA-4 mRNA in granulosa cells was downregulated during follicle development; the peak of expression occurred in the 8-10 mm follicles, and the lowest expression was in the F1 follicles. GATA-6 was upregulated and reached its peak expression in the F1 follicles. These results indicate that the molecular structural differences in goose GATA-4 and GATA-6 may be related to their different roles during follicle development.

The cDNA for goose interferon gamma (goIFN-gamma) was cloned from PHA-stimulated goose peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by RT-PCR. This cDNA encodes a 19-amino acid signal peptide and a 145-amino acid mature protein, which shares a high homology with duck IFN-gamma. Recombinant mature goose interferon gamma (rgoIFN-gamma) generated from both prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems effectively inhibited the replication of goose paramyxovirus and recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus in vitro. These antiviral activities were abrogated by rabbit anti-rgoIFN-gamma antibodies in vitro. Furthermore, rgoIFN-gamma stimulated goose peritoneal macrophages to produce nitric oxide (NO) in vitro, demonstrating its macrophage activating factor (MAF) activity. Therefore, the availability of bioactive rgoIFN-gamma and its specific antibodies provides valuable tools for studying T cell immunity in geese.

Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinases (PI3K)-Protein kinase B (Akt)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway plays an important role in the synthesis and secretion of triacylglycerol. However, the mechanism of PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway in regulating lipid metabolism of goose liver was poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to determine how PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway regulating lipid metabolic homeostasis in goose hepatocytes. Goose primary hepatocytes were treated with different PI3K-Akt-mTOR signal inhibitors (LY294002, rapamycin and NVP-BEZ235) for 24 h. The results showed that these inhibitors evidently inhibited PI3K-Akt-mTOR downstream signaling. Meanwhile, these PI3K-Akt-mTOR inhibitors reduced intracellular lipid accumulation, decreased the mRNA expression and protein content of genes involved in the de novo fatty acid synthesis, while increased the transcriptional and protein level of key factors involved in fatty acid oxidation and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) assembly and secretion.

Poultry eggs from different species varied significantly, due to their divergent process of evolution. However, the information on egg characteristics has been limited mostly to chicken. The current study compared the egg quality, albumen physical and nutritional property for domesticated chicken, duck, goose, turkey, quail, and pigeon. Egg quality traits among different species differed significantly, such as egg weight (from 11 to 139 g), egg shape (from 1.28 to 1.44), proportion of yolk (from 19.3 to 37.9%), and breaking strength (from 0.91 to 8.04 kg/cm2). For the physical property of albumen gel, pigeon egg was the most special one. The albumen gel of pigeon egg had a transparent appearance (A = 1.23), and it had the highest hardness (121.7 g) and water-holding capacity (96%) but a medium level of total cutting work (440 g⋅s). Hence, it was easy for deformation but was hard to cut off when external force was applied. For nutritional compositions of egg albumen, goose egg had the highest moisture (89.21%) and lowest crude protein (8.5%) contents. Specific to amino acid, glutamic acid was found the most abundant in albumen of all six species. Egg albumen of turkey had the highest quantity of essential amino acids (EAA) and total amino acids (TAA), while duck and goose had relatively higher EAA/TAA ratios. Both PCA and cluster analysis revealed the high similarity of amino acid composition between duck and goose, and among quail, turkey, and chicken. The comparative data will improve the understanding of egg qualities of major poultry species and can be helpful in technological application of egg albumen.

The bar-headed goose (Anser indicus) crosses the Himalaya twice a year at altitudes where oxygen (O2) levels are less than half those at sea level and temperatures are below -20°C. Although it has been known for over three decades that the major hemoglobin (Hb) component of bar-headed geese has an increased affinity for O2, enhancing O2 uptake, the effects of temperature and interactions between temperature and pH on bar-headed goose Hb-O2 affinity have not previously been determined. An increase in breathing of the hypoxic and extremely cold air experienced by a bar-headed goose at altitude (due to the enhanced hypoxic ventilatory response in this species) could result in both reduced temperature and reduced levels of CO2 at the blood-gas interface in the lungs, enhancing O2 loading. In addition, given the strenuous nature of flapping flight, particularly in thin air, blood leaving the exercising muscle should be warm and acidotic, facilitating O2 unloading. To explore the possibility that features of blood biochemistry in this species could further enhance O2 delivery, we determined the P50 (the partial pressure of O2 at which Hb is 50% saturated) of whole blood from bar-headed geese under conditions of varying temperature and [CO2]. We found that blood-O2 affinity was highly temperature sensitive in bar-headed geese compared with other birds and mammals. Based on our analysis, temperature and pH effects acting on blood-O2 affinity (cold alkalotic lungs and warm acidotic muscle) could increase O2 delivery by twofold during sustained flapping flight at high altitudes compared with what would be delivered by blood at constant temperature and pH.

The physiological and biomechanical requirements of flight at high altitude have been the subject of much interest. Here, we uncover a steep relation between heart rate and wingbeat frequency (raised to the exponent 3.5) and estimated metabolic power and wingbeat frequency (exponent 7) of migratory bar-headed geese. Flight costs increase more rapidly than anticipated as air density declines, which overturns prevailing expectations that this species should maintain high-altitude flight when traversing the Himalayas. Instead, a "roller coaster" strategy, of tracking the underlying terrain and discarding large altitude gains only to recoup them later in the flight with occasional benefits from orographic lift, is shown to be energetically advantageous for flights over the Himalayas.

Genome clones and expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from the ascidian Ciona intestinalis and from the larvacean Oikopleura dioica were analysed for the presence of lysozyme-encoding genes. Two genes were found to potentially code for goose-type lysozymes in Oikopleura, while three or possibly more g-type proteins form the lysozyme complement of C. intestinalis, and at least one of these genes from each species is expressed based on EST data. No genes for chicken- or invertebrate-type lysozymes were found in either urochordate species. Consistent with this finding, extracts of Oikopleura animals possessed hydrolysing activity on bacterial cell walls, and this activity was not inhibited in the presence of a known inhibitor of chicken-type lysozyme. A wide range of isoelectric points for the predicted lysozymes from Ciona (pI 4.4, 6.4 and 9.9) and from Oikopleura (pI 5.0 and 8.0) suggests tissue-specific adaptations as well as specific functional roles of the lysozymes. Comparisons of gene structures, encoded sequences, cysteine residue content and their positions in the proteins indicate that the g-type lysozymes of Ciona intestinalis are more closely related to those of vertebrates than are the g-type lysozymes of Oikopleura. Multiple genes from each species may result from separate and lineage-specific duplications followed by functional specialisation.

Geese breeding in the Arctic have to do so in a short time-window while having sufficient body reserves. Hence, arrival time and body condition upon arrival largely influence breeding success. The green wave hypothesis posits that geese track a successively delayed spring flush of plant development on the way to their breeding sites. The green wave has been interpreted as representing either the onset of spring or the peak in nutrient biomass. However, geese tend to adopt a partial capital breeding strategy and might overtake the green wave to accomplish a timely arrival on the breeding site. To test the green wave hypothesis, we link the satellite-derived onset of spring and peak in nutrient biomass with the stopover schedule of individual Barnacle Geese. We find that geese track neither the onset of spring nor the peak in nutrient biomass. Rather, they arrive at the southernmost stopover site around the peak in nutrient biomass, and gradually overtake the green wave to match their arrival at the breeding site with the local onset of spring, thereby ensuring gosling benefit from the peak in nutrient biomass. Our approach for estimating plant development stages is critical in testing the migration strategies of migratory herbivores.

For successfully raising offspring, long-term monogamous pair partners need to be behaviorally and hormonally coordinated. In the monogamous, biparental greylag geese (Anser anser) a dyadic pairbond-specific measure, 'within-pair testosterone compatibility' (TC) indicated how closely synchronized are seasonal androgen levels, which co-varied with reproductive output. Males, in particular, were assumed to respond to their females' hormonal and fecundity phases. We now present experiments with biparental domestic geese (Anser domesticus) kept as pairs to ask whether TC occurs also in these generally polygynous animals. We further ask how different conditions of mate choice affect TC and whether established TC is maintained during a polygynous flock situation. We measured androgen metabolites (AM) non-invasively from individual droppings. In females, AM was related with gonadal activity as it increased after GnRH but not ACTH challenge. Females with preferred partners had higher maximum AM during egg laying and higher rates of initiating incubation than randomly paired females. Domestic ganders had seasonal AM patterns typical for polygynous males. Within-pair TC ranged from almost perfectly positive to non-correlated in domestic geese but mate choice did not explain TC variation. TC of previous pairs was generally reduced in the flock situation, probably confounded by factors of the social environment, i.e. mating opportunity and availability of multiple partners. On top of the underlying reproductive physiology our results suggest two episodic components of TC: a female androgen responsiveness to the preferred partner at least during egg formation, and the male's facultative potential to respond to her readiness to breed.

The full-length cDNA clone, NDV3GM122, and the three helperplasmids pCI-NP, pCI-P and pCI-L of Newcastle disease virus strain ZJI isolated from an outbreak in the goose were cotransfected into BSR-T7/5 cell expressing T7 RNA polymerase. Meanwhile, the full-length cDNA clone NDV3GM122 and the three helperplasmids, pCIneoNP, pCIneoP and pCIneoL which were derived from NDV strain La Sota, were also cotransfected into the cell, respectively. Indiect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was performed 48 to 96 hours post-transfection using NDV HN-specific monoclonal anbtibody (McAb) 6B1 and bright stainings were found in the transfectants, indicating that the full-length clone was functional and the HN protein was expressed. The transfected cell and the supernatant were mixed well and thereafter the mixture was inoculated into specific pathogen free (SPF) chicken eggs. The allanotoic fluid of the injected eggs gave a positive hemagglutinin( HA) titer ranging from 16 to 32 in the secondary passage and increased to 128 in the third passage, which was same to the level of parent wild-type virus. The allantoic fluid containing the recovered NDV was analyzed in hemagglutination inhibition( HI) test by using McAb 6B1 and the specific inhibition was found. The typical morphology of the produced NDV was detected in the electronic microscope. The results mentioned above demonstrated that infectious NDV of strain ZJI was successfully generated, which laid good foundation for the further related research.

Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase was purified from goose uropygial gland, reduced, carboxymethylated, and digested with trypsin. Several peptides were purified by high performance liquid chromatography and their amino acid sequences determined. Oligonucleotide probes were prepared based on their amino acid sequences. Size-selected RNA from the goose uropygial gland was used to construct cDNA libraries in lambda gt11 and pUC9 vectors. Immunological screening of the lambda gt11 cDNA library yielded one clone, lambda DC1, which contained a 2.2-kilobase pair insert; hybridization with the synthetic oligonucleotide probes confirmed its identity as malonyl decarboxylase. Screening of the pUC9 cDNA library with the insert of lambda DC1 as a probe detected one clone, pDC2, with an insert of 2.9 kilobase pairs. The nucleotide sequences of the two cDNAs revealed an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 462 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence was confirmed as malonyl-CoA decarboxylase by matching it to the amino acid sequences of three tryptic peptides derived from mature enzyme. Northern blot analysis of mRNA from goose brain, kidney, liver, lung, and gland revealed malonyl-decarboxylase mRNA of 3000 nucleotides. Since clone pDC2 contains a 2928-nucleotide insert, it represents nearly the full length of mRNA. Brain, kidney, lung, and liver contained less than 1% of the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase mRNA in the gland. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA showed a single band in both liver and gland, suggesting that malonyl-CoA decarboxylase is a single copy gene.

The effect of aggregating agents on the amounts and nature of released proteins from washed goose and chicken thrombocytes was studied. The released protein material was separated on Sepharose 4B. Protein fractions with low molecular weight were next chromatographed on Sephadex G-200. The released proteins from thrombin aggregated pig platelets were analysed in the same way. It was shown that during aggregation avian thrombocytes release protein material containing a well separated fraction (the major component) which seems to correspond to a platelet specific beta-thromboglobulin.

With normal diets, removal of the crop in Japanese quail and domestic fowls caused reductions in mean meal lengths and sizes, and compensatory increases in meal frequencies, only in those (30-40%) birds that had previously eaten larger, less frequent meals. Sham operation had no such effect. Cropectomy had less effect on feeding activity parameters when quail were fed on a diluted (40% cellulose) diet, and had no effect on diurnal patterns of feeding with either undiluted or diluted food (all birds tending to eat more at the end of the day). This may have been because cropectomized birds could store food in the oesophagus in amounts similar to those previously stored in the crop. Cropectomy had no apparent long-term effect on food intake with undiluted diets, but may have suppressed it slightly with diluted food. In intact quail and fowls, with ad lib access to food when killed, crops were often found to be empty with undiluted food, but were rarely so with diluted food. Gizzards also tended to hold more with diluted food, but were never completely empty with any diet. The post-crop oesophagus and proventriculus were empty in nearly all birds. In quail fasted for two hours, then allowed to feed for 20 min and killed at intervals over a further two hours, maximum amounts of undiluted and diluted food in crops and gizzards were generally greater than in ad lib-fed quail. Crops and gizzards emptied faster with diluted than with undiluted food, but no gizzard was completely empty two hours after feeding. The results of these experiments indicate that, with normal diets, meal termination (satiety) during most of the day is associated with partial crop filling in (30-40%) birds that habitually eat larger, less frequent meals, and with varying degrees of gizzard filling in birds with smaller meals. Satiety involves more crop filling in more birds with diluted food, and this may also apply to other factors that cause increased feeding activity. Meal initiation (hunger) may be associated with partial gizzard emptying in all birds. At some stage towards the end of the day there is usually a conditioned change to cumulative filling of the crop with enough food to be processed overnight.

Eimeria truncata oocysts were isolated from a naturally infected goose stock. Domestic geese and ducks were inoculated with sporulated oocysts. Meronts, merozoites, macro- and microgamonts, and microgametes were studied with the light and electron microscope. These stages were located in the epithelial cells of the kidney tubules only. The meronts and merozoites showed the characteristic fine structures of Eimeria species. The macrogamonts only possessed one type of wall-forming bodies. It resembled the wall-forming bodies type I of other Eimeria species. One of the most prominent observations seemed to be the occurrence of osmiophilic granular material in the parasitophorous vacuoles of all endogenous stages of E. truncata.

Several mycoplasma isolation trials were performed on infertile goose eggs and goose embryos which died during incubation, as well as on geese of different ages. A total of 43 out of 110 goose eggs proved to be contaminated by mycoplasmas. Upon autopsy of birds which laid positive eggs, lesions were observed in the airsacs. Mycoplasmas could be isolated from their air sacs and oviduct. Four out of 15 strains examined biochemically and serologically with antisera prepared against all known avian mycoplasma species were identified as Acholeplasma laidlawii and A. axanthum, respectively. Two strains proved to be glucose-positive and arginine-negative and 9 were glucose-negative but arginine-positive. Some strains caused 50-80% mortality among embryos inoculated intra-yolk-sac at 12 days. In goslings inoculated at the age of 3 days with these strains, we observed fibrinous airsacculitis and peritonitis. By inoculating laying geese with one of the strains, we demonstrated decreasing egg production, increasing early-embryo mortality and egg transmission of mycoplasmas.

1. The comparative effects of raw soya beans on food intake, growth, digestive organ weight, and enzyme activities in goslings and chicks were studied, 2. Goslings were more affected than chicks by the ingestion of a raw soya-bean diet (RSD) in the following ways: reduction in food intake and growth rate; increase in relative weight of the digestive organs; reduction in specific activities of lipase (EC3.1.1.3), amylase (EC3,2.1.1) and chymotrypsin (EC3.4.4.5) in the pancreas (not affected in chicks); greater inhibition of trypsin (EC 3.4.4.5) in the pancreas (not affectd in chicks); greater inhibition of trypsin (EC3.4.4.4.), chymotrypsin and amylase in the inteatinal contents of goslings than of chicks. 3. Addition of methionine to the RSD improved food intake and growth rate more in goslings than in chiks. 4. The interrelationships between enzyme activities, food passage rate, nutrient absorption and food intake regulation are discussed.

In pooled bile of chicken, turkey, duck and goose immunoglobulins (Igs)+ were found in relatively high amounts between 4.5 and 15.0 mg/ml (corresponding to 28 to 36% of the total protein contents). All biliary Ig fractions studied possess (H2L2)n structure estimated by SDS-PAGE. In chicken and turkey L chains are assumed to be non-covalently linked to the polymeric H chains. In duck and goose L chains are completely linked to H chains. The Mr of H chains are rather similar: 64 kDa for the Igs of chicken and turkey bile and 67 kDa for the biliary Igs of duck and goose. There are slight differences in the electrophoretic mobility: Chicken and turkey Igs are beta 1/alpha 2-globulins and the corresponding Ig fractions from duck and goose are beta 2-globulins.

Wild water birds are the natural reservoir for low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses (AIV). However, our ability to investigate the epizootiology of AIV in these migratory populations is challenging and, despite intensive worldwide surveillance, remains poorly understood. We conducted a cross-sectional, retrospective analysis in Pacific Flyway Lesser Snow Geese, Chen caerulescens, to investigate AIV serology and infection patterns. We collected nearly 3000 sera samples from Snow Geese at two breeding colonies in Russia and Canada during 1993-1996 and swab samples from >4000 birds at wintering and migration areas in the United States during 2006-2011. We found seroprevalence and annual seroconversion varied considerably among years. Seroconversion and infection rates also differed between Snow Goose breeding colonies and wintering areas, suggesting that AIV exposure in this gregarious waterfowl species is likely occurring during several phases (migration, wintering, and potentially breeding areas) of the annual cycle. We estimated AIV antibody persistence was longer (14 months) in female geese compared to males (6 months). This relatively long period of AIV antibody persistence suggests that subtype-specific serology may be an effective tool for detection of exposure to subtypes associated with highly pathogenic AIV. Our study provides further evidence of high seroprevalence in Arctic goose populations, and estimates of annual AIV seroconversion and antibody persistence for North American waterfowl. We suggest future AIV studies include serology to help elucidate the epizootiological dynamics of AIV in wild bird populations.

The experimental time-courses of eight avian lysozymes, seven hen-type lysozymes and one goose-type lysozyme, were measured with a substrate of chitopentaose (GlcNAc)5 at pH 5.0 and 50 degrees C. Chitooligosaccharides in the reaction mixture were analyzed by high-performance gel-filtration. From the experimental time-courses, the overall reaction rates represented by the disappearance of the initial substrate and the values of reaction parameters were estimated by computer analysis. With taking hen lysozyme as the reference, the values of reaction parameters estimated were correlated to the replaced amino acid residue in the binding site of the lysozyme, and the roles of some amino acid residues in the binding site were discussed.

This study provides accurate near infrared (NIR) spectroscopic models on some laboratory determined clinicochemical parameters (i.e. total lipid (5.57±1.95 g/l), triglyceride (2.59±1.36 mmol/l), total cholesterol (3.81±0.68 mmol/l), high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (2.45±0.58 mmol/l)) of blood serum samples of fattened geese. To increase the performance of multivariate chemometrics, samples significantly deviating from the regression models implying laboratory error were excluded from the final calibration datasets. Reference data of excluded samples having outlier spectra in principal component analysis were not marked as false. Samples deviating from the regression models but having non outlier spectra in PCA were identified as having false reference constituent values. Based on the NIR selection methods, 5% of the reference measurement data were rated as doubtful. The achieved models reached R(2) of 0.864, 0.966, 0.850, 0.793, and RMSE of 0.639 g/l, 0.232 mmol/l, 0.210 mmol/l, 0.241 mmol/l for total lipid, triglyceride, total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol, respectively, during independent validation. Classical analytical techniques focus on single constituents and often require chemicals, time-consuming measurements, and experienced technicians. NIR technique provides a quick, cost effective, non-hazardous alternative method for analysis of several constituents based on one single spectrum of each sample, and it also offers the possibility for looking at the laboratory reference data critically. Evaluation of reference data to identify and exclude falsely analyzed samples can provide warning feedback to the reference laboratory, especially in the case of analyses where laboratory methods are not perfectly suited to the subjected material and there is an increased chance of laboratory error.

Quantifying a relationship between heart rate (f(H)) and rate of oxygen consumption (V(O(2))) allows the estimation of V(O(2)) from f(H) recordings in free-ranging birds. It has been proposed that this relationship may vary throughout an animal's annual cycle, due to changes in physiological status. Barnacle geese, Branta leucopsis, provide an ideal model to test this hypothesis, as they exhibit significant intra-annual variability in body mass, body composition and abdominal temperature, even in captivity. Heart rate data loggers were implanted in 14 captive barnacle geese, and at six points in the year the relationship between f(H) and V(O(2)) was determined. The f(H)/V(O(2)) relationship was also determined in seven moulting wild barnacle geese to examine whether relationships from captive animals might be applicable to wild animals. In captive barnacle geese, the f(H)/V(O(2)) relationship was significantly different only between two out of the six periods when the relationship was determined (late September-early October and November). Accounting for changes in physiological parameters such as body mass, body composition and abdominal temperature did not eliminate this difference. The relationship between f(H) and V(O(2)) obtained from wild geese was significantly different from all of the relationships derived from the captive geese, suggesting that it is not possible to apply calibrations from captive birds to wild geese. However, the similarity of the f(H) and V(O(2)) relationship derived during moult in the captive geese to those during the remainder of the annual cycle implies it is not unreasonable to assume that the relationship between f(H)/V(O(2)) during moult in the wild geese is indicative of the relationship throughout the remainder of the annual cycle.

Geese feather production and the quality of downy feathers are additional economically important traits in the geese industry. However, little information is available about the molecular mechanisms fundamental to feather formation and the quality of feathers in geese. This study conducted de novo transcriptome sequencing analysis of two related geese species using the Illumina 4000 platform to determine the genes involved in embryonic skin feather follicle development. A total of 165,564,278 for Anser anser and 144,595,262 for Anser cygnoides clean reads were generated, which were further assembled into 77,134 unigenes with an average length of 906 base pairs in Anser anser and 66,041 unigenes with an average length of 922 base pairs in Anser cygnoides. To recognize the potential regulatory roles of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during geese embryonic skin feather follicle development, the obtained unigenes were annotated to Gene Ontology (GO), Eukaryotic Orthologous Groups (KOG), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) for functional analysis. In both species, GO and KOG had shown similar distribution patterns during functional annotation except for KEGG, which showed significant variation in signaling enrichment. Anser asnser was significantly enriched in the calcium signaling pathway, whereas Anser cygnoides was significantly enriched with glycerolipid metabolism. Further analysis indicated that 14,227 gene families were conserved between the species, among which a total of 20,715 specific gene families were identified. Comparative RNA-Seq data analysis may reveal inclusive knowledge to assist in the identification of genetic regulators at a molecular level to improve feather quality production in geese and other poultry species.

Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) is a rate limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids. It has been cloned from several species: Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, Homo Sapiens and Gallus gallus, but not from Anser anser. This study was conducted to isolate the SCD1 cDNA sequence and investigate the effect of overfeeding on SCD1 gene tissue expression in Landes goose. The complete cDNA is 3294 bp in length, with an ORF of 1.083 bp encoding a predicted polypeptide of 360 amino acids and 5'/3'-UTR of 74 and 2137 bp, respectively. Quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) was used to examine SCD1 expression in heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, gizzard, glandular stomach, intestine, crureus, pectoral muscle, hypothalamus and adipose tissue (abdominal fat) in both the overfed and control group. SCD1 mRNA was highly expressed in goose fatty liver, and the expression levels of SCD1 in liver and fat of overfeeding group were more than double that of the control group. During the overfeeding period, SCD1 expression in liver and adipose tissue reached the highest level after 70 days, but declined at 79 days. In the control group, after fasting 24h, the expression level of SCD1 gene in tissues declined sharply. However, SCD1 gene expression in hypothalamus was unaffected. The results of this study provide a theoretical basis to study the relationship between SCD1 gene expression and the formation of fatty liver of Landes goose in response to overfeeding.

The Bohr effect data for bar-headed goose, greylag goose and pheasant hemoglobins can be fitted with the Wyman equation for the Bohr effect, but under one proviso: that the pKa of His146β does not change following the T→R quaternary transition. This assumption is based on the x-ray structure of bar-headed goose hemoglobin, which shows that the salt-bridge formed between His146β and Asp94β in human deoxyhemoglobin is not formed in goose deoxyhemoglobin. When the Bohr data for chicken hemoglobin were fitted by making the same assumption, the pKa of the NH3+ terminal group of Val1α decreased from 7.76 to 6.48 following the T→R transition. When the data were fitted without making any assumption, the pKa of the NH3+ terminal group increased from 7.57 to 7.77 following the T→R transition. We demonstrate that avian hemoglobin Bohr data are readily fitted with the Wyman equation because avian hemoglobins lack His77β. From curve-fitting to Bohr data we estimate the pKas of the NH3+ terminal group of Val1α in the R and T states to be 6.33±0.1 and 7.22±0.1, respectively. We provide evidence indicating that these pKas are more accurate than estimates from kinetic studies.

Hematologic parameters were studied in giant Canada geese (Branta canadensis maxima), mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos platyrhynchos) and various species of diving ducks at seasinal intervals throughout the year. Highest values for packed cell volume, hemoglobin content and erythrocyte counts were found in the winter and pre-nesting periods. Mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin varied inversely with these values.

Acute copper toxicosis resulted in Canada geese, Branta canadensis, following ingestion of copper sulfate at about 600mg/kg from a small man-made pond on a game farm. The lesions were those associated with copper toxicosis in other avian species. The primary pathologic change was necrosis and sloughing of the proventriculus and gizzard. A greenish discoloration of the lungs also occurred.

A restriction fragment length polymorphism combined with direct PCR technique to differentiate goose and Muscovy duck parvoviruses (GPV and MDPV) was developed based on comparison of the NS gene of GPV and MDPV. Both GPV and MDPV genomic DNA can be amplified with 641 bp using the specific PCR primers. The PCR fragments can be cut into 463 bp and 178 bp only in the case of MDPV-derived PCR products, whereas the GPV-derived PCR products cannot. The method established in this study can be used to differentiate GPV and MDPV with high specificity and precision, by using a direct PCR kit and QuickCut enzyme, as quickly as conventional PCR.

Recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in poultry have raised interest in the interplay between avian influenza (AI) viruses and their wild hosts. Studies linking virus ecology to host ecology are still scarce, particularly for non-duck species. Here, we link capture-resighting data of greater white-fronted geese Anser albifrons albifrons with the AI virus infection data collected during capture in The Netherlands in four consecutive winters. We ask what factors are related to AI virus prevalence and whether there are ecological consequences associated with AI virus infection in staging white-fronted geese. Mean seasonal (low pathogenic) AI virus prevalence ranged between 2.5 and 10.7 per cent, among the highest reported values for non-duck species, and occurred in distinct peaks with near-zero prevalence before and after. Throat samples had a 2.4 times higher detection frequency than cloacal samples. AI virus infection was significantly related to age and body mass in some but not other winters. AI virus infection was not related to resighting probability, nor to maximum distance travelled, which was at least 191 km during the short infectious lifespan of an AI virus. Our results suggest that transmission via the respiratory route could be an important transmission route of AI virus in this species. Near-zero prevalence upon arrival on their wintering grounds, in combination with the epidemic nature of AI virus infections in white-fronted geese, suggests that white-fronted geese are not likely to disperse Asian AI viruses from their Siberian breeding grounds to their European wintering areas.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the change in protein expression in the testes of ganders at various breeding stages. A total of nine 3-year-old male White Roman ganders were used. The blood and testis samples were collected at the nonbreeding, sexual reactivation, and breeding stages for sex hormone analysis and proteomic analysis, respectively. The testicular weight and serum testosterone observed for ganders at the breeding stage were higher than those for ganders at nonbreeding and sexual reactivation stages (P < 0.05). There were 124 protein spots differentially expressed in the testes of ganders at various reproductive stages. A total of 107 protein spots of 74 proteins was identified through mass spectrometry. Most of the differentially expressed proteins were responsible for the molecular functions of protein binding (24%) and catalytic activity (16%). A functional pathway analysis suggested that proteins involved in steroidogenesis, metabolism, and spermatogenesis pathways changed in the White Roman geese at various reproductive stages. In conclusion, ganders at various reproductive stages exhibited different levels of testosterone and protein expression in the testes. The varied levels of the proteins might be essential and unique key factors in seasonal reproduction in ganders.

The complete amino acid sequence of cassowary (Casuarius casuarius) goose type lysozyme was analyzed by direct protein sequencing of peptides obtained by cleavage with trypsin, V8 protease, chymotrypsin, lysyl endopeptidase, and cyanogen bromide. The N-terminal residue of the enzyme was deduced to be a pyroglutamate group by analysis with a LC/MS/MS system equipped with the oMALDI ionization source, and then confirmed by a glutamate aminopeptidase enzyme. The blocked N-terminal is the first reported in this enzyme group. The positions of disulfide bonds in this enzyme were chemically identified as Cys4-Cys60 and Cys18-Cys29. Cassowary lysozyme was proved to consist of 185 amino acid residues and had a molecular mass of 20408 Da calculated from the amino acid sequence. The amino acid sequence of cassowary lysozyme compared to that of reported G-type lysozymes had identities of 90%, 83%, and 81%, for ostrich, goose, and black swan lysozymes, respectively. The amino acid substitutions at PyroGlu1, Glu19, Gly40, Asp82, Thr102, Thr156, and Asn167 were newly detected in this enzyme group. The substituted amino acids that might contribute to substrate binding were found at subsite B (Asn122Ser, Phe123Met). The amino acid sequences that formed three alpha-helices and three beta-sheets were completely conserved. The disulfide bond locations and catalytic amino acid were also strictly conserved. The conservation of the three alpha-helices structures and the location of disulfide bonds were considered to be important for the formation of the hydrophobic core structure of the catalytic site and for maintaining a similar three-dimensional structure in this enzyme group.

Neurosecretory granules have been isolated from goose posterior pituitaries and their contents have been analyzed by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Vasotocin and mesotocin have been identified by their biological activities and their retention times compared with those of synthetic peptides. MSEL- and VLDV-neurophysins have been characterized by their N-terminal sequences, their electrophoretic migrations and their retention times, compared with those of purified goose neurophysins. In contrast to the two-step processing of mammalian provasopressin, processing of the vasotocin - MSEL-neurophysin precursor appears to involve only one cleavage giving the hormone and a "big" MSEL-neurophysin homologous to mammalian MSEL-neurophysin extended by copeptin.

The role of mannose containing molecules in Sindbis virus envelope glycoproteins and cell membrane receptors was investigated by means of concanavalin A (con A). Treatment of virus or BHK 21 cells with the lectin before infection reduced viral infectivity. Hemagglutination and hemolysis showed a different sensitivity to con A. Hemagglutination was not affected by the lectin and treatment of erythrocytes with con A produced an enhancement of agglutinability by the virus. Hemolytic activity was, on the contrary, strongly reduced by the lectin. The inhibition observed is due to an action on viral structures and not to an interaction with erythrocyte receptors because con A did not affect the hemolysis when preincubated with erythrocytes.

Live attenuated vaccines have been used for control of the disease caused by goose parvovirus (GPV), but the mechanism involved in attenuation of GPV remains elusive. This report presents the complete nucleotide sequences of two live attenuated strains of GPV (82-0321V and VG32/1) that were independently developed in Taiwan and Europe, together with the parental strain of 82-0321V and a field strain isolated in Taiwan in 2006. Sequence comparisons showed that 82-0321V and VG32/1 had multiple deletions and substitutions in the inverted terminal repeats region when compared with their parental strain or the field virus, but these changes did not affect the formation of the hairpin structure essential for viral replication. Moreover, 82-0321V and VG32/1 had five amino acid changes in the non-structural protein, but these changes were located at positions distant from known functional motifs in the non-structural protein. In contrast, 82-0321V had nine changes and VG32/1 had 11 changes in their capsid proteins (VP1), and the majority of these changes occurred at positions close to the putative receptor binding sites of VP1, as predicted using the structure of adeno-associated virus 2 as the model system. Taken together, the results suggest that changes in sequence near the receptor binding sites of VP1 might be responsible for attenuation of GPV. This is the first report of complete nucleotide sequences of GPV other than the virulent B strain, and suggests a possible mechanism for attenuation of GPV.

Canada goose goslings were exposed to turf sprayed with DZN diazinon 50W application (2.24 kg a.i./ha). The control plot was subjected to a water application. One foot from each bird was placed outdoors for 7 d to decompose and the other foot was kept frozen. Diazinon residues were analyzed on both feet. Results showed that diazinon was detected from undecomposed and decomposed feet of the birds. Diazinon residues were below the level of detection (<0.01 ppm, a.i.) on the feet from the control goslings. Decomposed feet may be used for determining insecticide exposure when the traditional matrices are not available.

The bar-headed goose flies over the Himalayan mountains on its migratory route between South and Central Asia, reaching altitudes of up to 9,000 m. We compared control of breathing in this species with that of low-altitude waterfowl by exposing birds to step decreases in inspired O(2) under both poikilocapnic and isocapnic conditions. Bar-headed geese breathed substantially more than both greylag geese and pekin ducks during severe environmental (poikilocapnic) hypoxia (5% inspired O(2)). This was entirely due to an enhanced tidal volume response to hypoxia, which would have further improved parabronchial (effective) ventilation. Consequently, O(2) loading into the blood and arterial Po(2) were substantially improved. Because air convection requirements were similar between species at 5% inspired O(2), it was the enhanced tidal volume response (not total ventilation per se) that improved O(2) loading in bar-headed geese. Other observations suggest that bar-headed geese depress metabolism less than low-altitude birds during hypoxia and also may be capable of generating higher inspiratory airflows. There were no differences between species in ventilatory sensitivities to isocapnic hypoxia, the hypoxia-induced changes in blood CO(2) tensions or pH, or hypercapnic ventilatory sensitivities. Overall, our results suggest that evolutionary changes in the respiratory control system of bar-headed geese enhance O(2) loading into the blood and may contribute to this species' exceptional ability to fly high.

Animals may memorise spatial and social information for many months and even years. Here, we investigated long-term memory of hierarchically ordered relationships, where the position of a reward depended on the relationship of a stimulus relative to other stimuli in the hierarchy. Seventeen greylag geese (Anser anser) had been trained on discriminations between successive pairs of five or seven implicitly ordered colours, where the higher ranking colour in each pair was rewarded. Geese were re-tested on the task 2, 6 and 12 months after learning the dyadic colour relationships. They chose the correct colour above chance at all three points in time, whereby performance was better in colour pairs at the beginning or end of the colour series. Nonetheless, they also performed above chance on internal colour pairs, which is indicative of long-term memory for quantitative differences in associative strength and/or for relational information. There were no indications for a decline in performance over time, indicating that geese may remember dyadic relationships for at least 6 months and probably well over 1 year. Furthermore, performance in the memory task was unrelated to the individuals' sex and their performance while initially learning the dyadic colour relationships. We discuss possible functions of this long-term memory in the social domain.

Susceptibility to liver steatosis was studied in Landes and Poland geese, which are hyper- and hyporesponsive, respectively, to overfeeding. Plasma lipoproteins were characterized at different stages of the overfeeding process, whereas fatty liver composition was determined after completion of overfeeding and slaughtering. Before overfeeding, plasma lipoprotein profile was typical of birds in both breeds, except that very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) were low in triglyceride (approximately 30%). Moreover, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentration was higher in the Poland geese (6.44 vs 4.97 g/L). During overfeeding, hepatic lipogenesis was increased, and fatty liver resulted from accumulation of primarily triglyceride (approximately 95% of lipid content), but also of all other lipids. This accumulation was significantly greater in the Landes geese for all lipids but phospholipid. Thus, the liver weight was 100% higher in this breed (1,005 g vs 485 g), whereas lipid release during sterilization was twofold higher (26.3 vs 7.5%). Parallel, plasma concentration and triglyceride content of hepatic lipoproteins, VLDL and HDL, increased about one- to twofold, this effect being greater in the Poland geese. Therefore, channeling of triglyceride towards secretion rather than in situ storage may be responsible for the hyporesponsiveness of this breed to overfeeding. In both breeds, and especially in the Landes geese, a relative deficiency in phospholipid synthesis together with an enhanced secretion may be limiting factors of hepatocyte hypertrophia and, therefore, of steatosis.

Since 2017, a new type of goose-origin astrovirus (GoAstV) disease occurred in China. This disease can cause joint swelling of sick geese, and the anatomy shows a clear urate precipitation in the viscera. The rate of death or amputation can reach more than 30%, revealing its severe pathogenicity. One novel goose-origin astrovirus strain, designated as CXZ18, was isolated from diseased geese with a fatal infection characterized by visceral urate deposition. Similar clinical anatomy symptoms were partially reproduced by attacking infection of healthy geese. The CXZ18 has no hemagglutination with chicken erythrocyte, only reproduced in goose embryos, not in SPF chicken or duck embryos. The complete genome-encoded three open reading frames (ORFs) of CXZ18 were 7252 nt in length. BLAST-based homology analysis of viral complete genome showed that CXZ18 has only 53.0%-61.8% with other classic avian astrovirus from various hosts. Further analysis of ORF 1a, ORF 1b, and ORF 2 genes revealed that the isolate was genetically distinct from known astroviruses and belonged to a distinctive branch of avian astroviruses. To conclude, a naturally occurring novel nephrotic astrovirus, distinguished with all previously reported avian astroviruses, was derived from goose.

Of two closely related species of geese, one, the greylag goose, lives in the Indian plains all year round, while the other, the bar-headed goose, lives at the Tibetan lakes and migrates across the Himalayas to winter in India. Another species, the Andean goose, lives in the High Andes all year round. Possession of a Hb with high oxygen affinity helps to adapt bar-headed and Andean geese to high altitudes. The Hb amino acid sequences of the bar-headed and the greylag geese differ by four substitutions, of which only one is unique among bird sequences: Pro-119 alpha (H2)----Ala. Perutz proposed that the two-carbon gap left by this substitution at the alpha 1 beta 1 contact raises the oxygen affinity, because it relaxes the tension in the deoxy or T structure [Perutz, M. F. (1983) Mol. Biol. Evol. 1, 1-28]. It was later found that the Hb of the Andean goose has a gap in the same position, due to the complementary substitution Leu-55 beta (D6)----Ser. We have tested Perutz's hypothesis by introducing each of these substitutions into human globin synthesized in Escherichia coli. The reconstituted Hbs combine cooperatively with oxygen. Their oxygen affinities exceed that of normal human Hb by an even larger factor than that found between the high-flying geese and the greylag goose. The mutant Hb Met-55 beta (D6)----Ser was crystallized. Its structure is the same as that of HbA, except in the immediate environment of the gap left by the substitution of the serine for the methionine side chain, which evidently causes the increased oxygen affinity of this Hb.

Using open-flow respirometry and video footage (25 frames s(-1)), the energy expenditure and hindlimb kinematics of barnacle geese, Branta leucopsis, were measured whilst they were exercising on a treadmill at gradients of +7 and -7 deg, and on a level surface. In agreement with previous studies, ascending a gradient incurred metabolic costs higher than those experienced on level ground at comparable speeds. The geese, however, are the first species to show an increased duty factor when ascending a gradient. This increased duty factor was accompanied by a longer stance time, which was probably to enable the additional force required for ascending to be generated. Contrary to previous findings, the geese did not experience decreased metabolic costs when descending a gradient. For a given speed, the geese took relatively shorter and quicker strides when walking downhill. This 'choppy' stride and perhaps a lack of postural plasticity (an inability to adopt a more crouched posture) may negate any energy savings gained from gravity's assistance in moving the centre of mass downhill. Also contrary to previous studies, the incremental increase in metabolic cost with increasing speed was similar for each gradient, indicating that the efficiency of locomotion (mechanical work done/chemical energy consumed) is not constant across all walking speeds. The data here suggest that there are species-specific metabolic responses to locomotion on slopes, as well as the established kinematics differences. It is likely that a suite of factors, such as ecology, posture, gait, leggedness and foot morphology, will subtly affect an organism's ability to negotiate gradients.

Carcasses of 42 and 17 Aleutian Canada geese (Branta canadensis leucopareia), a federally listed endangered species, were found on ocean beaches near Crescent City, California, and near Pacific City, Oregon, respectively, following severe storms. Necropsies and other information suggest that the birds were flushed during the storms and somehow entered the water where they were washed into the surf and drowned.

Recent reviews identified the reliance on fecal or cloacal samples as a significant limitation hindering our understanding of the avian gastrointestinal (gut) microbiota and its function. We investigated the microbiota of the esophagus, duodenum, cecum, and colon of a wild urban population of Canada goose (Branta canadensis). From a population sample of 30 individuals, we sequenced the V4 region of the 16S SSU rRNA on an Illumina MiSeq and obtained 8,628,751 sequences with a median of 76,529 per sample. These sequences were assigned to 420 bacterial OTUs and a single archaeon. Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes accounted for 90% of all sequences. Microbiotas from the four gut regions differed significantly in their richness, composition, and variability among individuals. Microbial communities of the esophagus were the most distinctive whereas those of the colon were the least distinctive, reflecting the physical downstream mixing of regional microbiotas. The downstream mixing of regional microbiotas was also responsible for the majority of observed co-occurrence patterns among microbial families. Our results indicate that fecal and cloacal samples inadequately represent the complex patterns of richness, composition, and variability of the gut microbiota and obscure patterns of co-occurrence of microbial lineages.

In this study, we examined gene expression in order to identify genes that are differentially expressed between the hepatocytes of Sichuan White geese and Landes geese. We hypothesized that such genes may be involved in the different predispositions between these two species to develop hepatic steatosis. RNA was isolated from primary hepatocytes of the two species, and suppression subtractive hybridization was employed to screen for genes that showed differences in mRNA expression. We built and characterized two reciprocal cDNA libraries that were enriched in genes up-regulated in Landes geese or Sichuan White geese. Using dot blot analysis we identified 128 of 600 randomly selected sequences that demonstrated differential expression between the two species. Of these differentially expressed genes, 115 sequences shared high homology with 46 known genes and 13 sequences corresponded to eight novel expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Based on functional clustering, up and down-regulated genes were mostly related to lipid metabolism, nuclear mRNA splicing, enzyme activity and transcription control. The expression of 18 selected clones was further studied by quantitative PCR. The data showed that eight clones similar to the genes ACSL5, CTGF, CIDEA, PPARγ, PCK, GSTS1, RPS4X, and THBS1 had significantly higher expression levels in the hepatocytes of Landes geese. In contrast, seven clones similar to the genes ADH5, YBX1, ASAH1, UCB, AOPVLDL, SCD-1, and ELOVL-6 had significantly higher expression levels in the hepatocytes of Sichuan White geese.

Although Orinoco goose (Neochen jubata) is an anatid species widely distributed in South America, scarce are the reports on the occurrence of arthropod-borne pathogens in this avian species. The present work aimed to verify, by serological and molecular methods, the occurrence of haemosporida piroplasmids and Anaplasmataceae agents in wild Orinoco geese captured in Brazil. Between 2010 and 2014, 62 blood samples were collected from free-living geese captured in the Araguaia River, Goiás State, Brazil. Six geese (10%) were seropositive for Anaplasma phagocytophilum, showing titers ranging from 40 and 80. Twenty out of 62 blood samples (32.25%) were positive in nested PCR for hemosporidia (cytochrome b gene). Fifteen and five sequences shared identity with Haemoproteus and Plasmodium, respectively. Six out of 62 blood samples (9.68%) were positive in nested PCR for Babesia spp. (18S rRNA gene); one sequence showed to be closely related to Babesia vogeli. Thirty (48.38%) out of 62 Orinoco geese blood samples were positive in nested cPCR assays for Anaplasmataceae agents (16S rRNA gene): three for Anaplasma spp. and 27 for Ehrlichia. Six geese were simultaneously positive to Haemoproteus and Ehrlichia; three animals were co-positive to different Ehrlichia species/genotypes; and one goose sample was positive for both Anaplasma and Ehrlichia. The present work showed the occurrence of Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, Babesia, Plasmodium, and Haemoproteus species in free-living N. jubata in Brazil. The threat of these arthropod-borne pathogens in Orinoco goose's fitness, especially during the breading season, should be assessed in the future.

Serum amyloid A (SAA) is of interest as the circulating precursor of amyloid A protein, the fibrillar component of AA (secondary) amyloid deposits, and also as an extremely sensitive and rapid major acute phase protein. Serum concentrations of acute phase proteins (APPs) provide valuable information about the diagnosis and prognosis of various diseases, and thus the relevance of APPs for monitoring the health status of domestic animals is widely accepted. More importantly, the measurement of SAA concentration assists in assessing the prognosis in secondary amyloidosis, which is a common disease of geese, affecting an increasing number of animals. In the present study we introduce a highly sensitive goose-specific ELISA method for measuring SAA concentration in goose serum or plasma samples. Samples were taken from geese of the Landes Grey and Hungarian White breeds, which were stimulated for an acute phase reaction by administration of a commercially available fowl cholera vaccine containing inactivated Pasteurella multocida. Strong and characteristically rapid acute phase responses were measured in both breeds, peaking at approximately 24 h after inoculation. The maximum SAA concentration was 1200 microg/ml. At 72 h postinoculation, the concentrations returned to pre-inoculation values. There was significantly (p = 0.004) less intense response in the control groups; however, a very mild increase of SAA levels was detected due to the stress inevitably caused by the sampling procedure.

Liver weight is an important economic trait in the fatty goose liver industry. Liver-type fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) is involved in the formation and metabolism of fatty acids. Thus, we hypothesized that sequence polymorphisms in L-FABP were associated with fatty liver weight in goose. We first isolated, sequenced, and characterized the goose L-FABP gene, which had not been previously reported. The goose L-FABP gene was 2490 bp and included 4 exons coding for a 126-amino acid protein. Analysis of expression levels of the goose L-FABP gene in different tissues showed that the expression level in the liver tissue was higher than in other tissues, and was significantly higher in the liver tissue of overfed geese than in control geese. Moreover, a single nucleotide polymorphism located at 774 bp in the gene was identified in a Landes goose population. To test whether this single nucleotide polymorphism was associated with fatty liver production, liver weight and the ratio of liver to carcass weights were determined for the 3 genotypes with this single nucleotide polymorphism (TT, TG, GG) in overfed Landes geese. Our data indicate that individuals with the GG genotype had higher values for the variables measured than those with the other 2 genotypes, suggesting that L-FABP can be a selection marker for the trait of fatty liver production in goose.

1. The study was conducted to evaluate the effects of a dried Bacillus subtilis culture (DBSC) on growth performance and nutrient retention of goslings. 2. A total of 240 goslings were randomly divided into 4 dietary treatments with 6 replicates of 10 goslings per pen from 0 to 4 weeks of age. The 4 treatments consisted of a basal diet containing neither antibiotics nor DBSC (control), basal diet supplemented 5 mg Flavomycin/kg, and basal diet supplemented with 250 or 500 mg DBSC/kg. 3. Body weight and feed consumption were measured with pen as the experimental unit at 14 and 28 d of age, and excreta collections from each pen were carried out to determine nutrient retention ratio during the 4th week. 4. The results showed that the diet supplemented with 250 mg DBSC/kg increased average daily gain (ADG) by 6.9%, reduced average daily feed intake (ADFI) by 3.9%, and improved feed conversion ratio (FCR) by 10.3% in a 0-28 d feeding period, compared with the control diet. However, the diet containing 500 mg DBSC/kg did not effect these performance of goslings. 5. The goslings given the diet with 250 mg DBSC/kg had similar ADG, lower ADFI and significantly lower FCR to or than the goslings fed on the Flavomycin diet. 6. The results also showed that dietary DBSC supplementation improved dry matter and energy retention of goslings. 7. This study indicated that the diet containing a dried B. subtilis culture at 250 mg/kg offered large benefits to the growth performance of goslings, and these benefits could equal or exceed those from Flavomycin. It is suggested that the growth promoting effect of DBSC may be attributed to the improvement in the availability of dietary nutrients.

CD4 protein is a single chain transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily that recognizes the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. It plays an important role in cell-mediated immunity. Here, the full-length cDNA of CD4 in Chinese goose (Anser cygnoides) was cloned and identified. The goose CD4 is 1940bp in length and encodes a single open-reading frame of 480 amino acids. The putative amino acid sequence of goose CD4 consisted of a signal peptide, four potential N-glycosylation sites, a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic tail. The multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis suggested that goose CD4 shared a higher similarity with avian than other vertebrates. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that the highest level of CD4 mRNA transcripts was presented in the thymus, and relatively lower in the spleen, small intestine, brain and trachea. Low expression was seen in the bursa of fabricius, cecal tonsil, cecum, skin, lung, kidney and liver. In gosling, the CD4 transcript was expressed with high abundance in the thymus, and relatively lower in the spleen, cecal tonsil and small intestine. However, in adult goose, high expression was seen in the thymus, spleen and cecum, and relatively lower in the cecal tonsil and small intestine. During the course of NGVEV infection, the obvious increase in CD4 gene expression was observed in the spleen, bursa of fabricius and harderian gland. Interestingly, a notable decrease in CD4 mRNA expression in the small intestine at 5d PI and followed by an increase of that at 19d PI were shown.

Suppression subtractive hybridization was used to detect differential expression of genes in the livers of laying and prelaying geese. Liver tissues from prelaying and laying geese were dissected for mRNA extraction. The cDNA, reverse transcribed from liver mRNA of prelaying geese, was subtracted from the cDNA generated from the laying geese (forward subtraction). Five hundred seventy-six clones with possible differentially expressed gene fragments were observed by forward subtraction hybridization. After differential screening using the reverse and forward subtraction cDNA, 164 clones were subjected to gene sequence determination and further analysis. Using Northern analysis, 5 known and 8 unknown genes were shown to be highly expressed in the livers of laying geese compared with prelaying geese. Vitellogenin I, apoVLDL-II, ethanolamine kinase, G-protein gamma-5 subunit, and leucyl-tRNA synthase were highly expressed in the livers of laying geese compared with that from the prelaying geese (P<0.05). The expression of these known genes suggests that their function in the liver of laying geese is primarily involved in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. Several of these differentially expressed genes were found to be responsive to estrogen stimulation, confirming the involvement of these genes in the egg-laying function of the goose.

1. Patterns of temporary emigration (associated with non-breeding) are important components of variation in individual quality. Permanent emigration from the natal area has important implications for both individual fitness and local population dynamics. 2. We estimated both permanent and temporary emigration of black brent geese (Branta bernicla nigricans Lawrence) from the Tutakoke River colony, using observations of marked brent geese on breeding and wintering areas, and recoveries of ringed individuals by hunters. We used the likelihood developed by Lindberg, Kendall, Hines & Anderson 2001 (Combining band recovery data and Pollock's robust design to model temporary and permanent emigration. Biometrics, 57, 273-281) to assess hypotheses and estimate parameters. 3. Temporary emigration (the converse of breeding) varied among age classes up to age 5, and differed between individuals that bred in the previous years vs. those that did not. Consistent with the hypothesis of variation in individual quality, individuals with a higher probability of breeding in one year also had a higher probability of breeding the next year. 4. Natal fidelity of females ranged from 0.70 +/- 0.07-0.96 +/- 0.18 and averaged 0.83. In contrast to Lindberg et al. (1998), we did not detect a relationship between fidelity and local population density. Natal fidelity was negatively correlated with first-year survival, suggesting that competition among individuals of the same age for breeding territories influenced dispersal. Once females nested at the Tutakoke River, colony breeding fidelity was 1.0. 5. Our analyses show substantial variation in individual quality associated with fitness, which other analyses suggest is strongly influenced by early environment. Our analyses also suggest substantial interchange among breeding colonies of brent geese, as first shown by Lindberg et al. (1998).

The infectivity of six Blastocystis isolates obtained from two domestic chickens, two Japanese quails and two domestic geese, were examined in 1-week-old male chicks. All six isolates were able to infect the chicks via the intracecal inoculation of 1x10(6) cells of cultured organisms. Since the infected chicks discharged many cysts in their feces, the infectivity of the concentrated cysts in chicks was compared among three isolates from different bird species. The CK86-1 and QQ93-3 isolates, which were obtained from a chicken and a quail, respectively, were successfully infected in chicks by orally inoculating with 1x10(2)-1x10(6) cysts. On the other hand, the AC03-1 isolate from a goose required more cysts to infect the chicks, from 1x10(3) cysts to 1x10(6) cysts. In addition, when an uninfected normal chick was housed with five experimentally inoculated chicks with cysts of the QQ93-3 isolate, the normal chick became infected, indicating the fecal-oral transmission of the cyst form among the birds. These results show that the transmission of Blastocystis infection occurs easily between the same or different bird species. Therefore, the proposal of new Blastocystis species on the basis of different avian host species is problematic.

In this study, the complete genome of the virulent strain LH of goose parvovirus (GPV) was sequenced and cloned into the pBluescript II (SK) plasmid vector. Sequence alignments of the inverted terminal repeats (ITR) of GPV strains revealed a common 14-nt-pair deletion in the stem of the palindromic structure in the LH strain and three other strains isolated after 1982 when compared to three GPV strains isolated earlier than that time. Transfection of 11-day-old embryonated goose eggs with the plasmid pLH, which contains the entire genome of strain LH, resulted in successful rescue of the infectious virus. Death of embryos after transfection via the chorioallantoic membrane infiltration route occurred earlier than when transfection was done via the allantoic cavity inoculation route. The rescued virus exhibited virulence similar to that of its parental virus, as evaluated by the mortality rate in goslings. Generation of the pathogenic infectious clone provides us with a powerful tool to elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of GPV in the future.

An avian poxvirus from cutaneous lesions in a Hawaiian goose (Branta sandvicensis) was characterized in this study. The virus was isolated by inoculation onto the chorioallantoic membranes (CAMs) of developing chicken embryos. Cytoplasmic inclusion bodies were observed on histopathological examination of CAM lesions. Western blotting analysis using polyclonal antiserum against fowl poxvirus (FWPV) showed differences from FWPV, but a similar antigenic profile between Hawaiian goosepox (HGP) isolate and two previous Hawaiian poxvirus isolates were observed. Still three avian poxviruses from Hawaiian birds showed distinguishable reaction in approximately 27, 34, 35, and 81 kDa proteins when polyclonal antibodies against the Hawaiian poxvirus isolate (Alala/lanakila) were used. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) of DNA of this isolate also showed differences from those of FWPV and previous avianpox isolates from Hawaiian forest birds. While nucleotide sequences of a 5.3-kb PstI-HindIII fragment of the genome of HGP isolate revealed very high homology (99% identities) with Canary poxvirus (CNPV) ORF266-274, and like CNPV, homologs of three FWPV ORFs (199, 200, and 202) including any reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) sequences are not present in the genome of HGP isolate.

Since 1987 penis-inflammation and -prolapse were observed in north-german breeder-geese. Up to 28% of the ganders showed local symptoms. In the females no clinical signs of cloaca-inflammation were seen. The general condition of the birds was good and there was no increased mortality. Egg production and fertility were not influenced. Bacteriological examinations of the altered penis-tissues revealed in different frequency microorganisms belonging to the genera Mycoplasma, Candida, Bacteroides, Clostridium, Streptococcus, Micrococcus, Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Escherichia, Proteus and Pseudomonas. Within 70 days only one third of the diseased ganders recovered completely, the others still showed penis-necrosis or -deformation. It is recommended to examine all ganders prior to each sexual season and to eliminate affected birds.

Dopamine D1 receptor (DRD1) is one of the dopamine receptors with seven transmembrane domains that are coupled to the G protein. In the present study, we cloned the full coding region of DRD1 gene by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends from the goose hypothalamus tissues. Results showed that the goose DRD1 cDNA (GenBank: KF156790) contained a 1,356 bp open reading frame encoding a protein 452 amino acid with a molecular weight of 50.52 kDa and a isoelectric point of 6.96. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the deduced amino acid sequence was 71-98% identical to the DRD1 protein of other species, contained seven transmembrane domains and four N-glycosylation sites. A phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that the deduced goose DRD1 protein had a close genetic relationship and evolutional distance with that of duck, chicken, and zebra finch. The semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis displayed goose DRD1 gene was widely expressed in all detected tissues, including heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, breast muscle, duodenum, sebum, pituitary, hypothalamus, ovary and oviduct. Eighteen single nucleotide polymorphisms were indentified in 3,169 bp length of this gene. For G90A mutation, the genotyping analysis of PCR-TspRI-RFLP showed the allele G was in dominance in all detected goose breeds, and the allele frequencies of this polymorphism were significantly different between Chinese goose breeds and foreign breeds (P<0.01). These findings will help us understand the functions of the DRD1 gene and the molecular breeding in geese.

This study was designed to quantitatively determined blood flow to the extraocular muscles (EOM) of animals showing a wide range of ocular motility Blood-flow values (ml/minute/gm) for EOM in primates (0.25 +/- 0.03), dogs (0.33 +/- 0.06), sheep (0.12 +/- 0.01), and geese (0.12 +/- 0.04) were determined using the Reference Sample Method with 15 +/- 3 micrometer 103Ru microspheres and complete cardiovascular monitoring. Mammalian EOM blood flow was significantly higher than that determined for other skeletal muscle; however, EOM blood-flow values for sheep were significantly lower than those for primates and dogs. No significant blood-flow differences were found between avian EOM and other skeletal muscle, reflecting the unique avian ocular anatomy. These data indicate that high blood flow is not a general property of EOM and suggest a relationship between functional ocular motility and blood flow.

The present study investigated 15 dead cases of captive wild goslings (Anser anser), which were bred in a small poultry farm in Shandong Province, China. The examined cases presented diverse clinical signs accompanied with neurological manifestations and fatal outcomes. Bacterial culture identified the gram-negative Neisseria sp. from the brain homogenate of most examined cases (10/15, 66.7%). The isolated bacteria were identified based on morphologic characteristics, biochemical tests and 16S rDNA typing. Results proved that 1 identical bacterial strain (BNO09-3) was isolated from the positive cases. The phylogeny based on the 16S rDNA gene sequences indicated that this isolate has a close relationship with various strains of genus Neisseria sp. isolated from liver and feces of duck. This is the first report of Neisseria sp. causing fatality in captive wild geese in China.

Ansocalcin is a novel goose eggshell matrix protein with 132 amino acid residues, which induces the formation of polycrystalline calcite aggregates in in vitro crystallization experiments. The central region of ansocalcin is characterized by the presence of multiplets of charged amino acids. To investigate the specific role of charged amino acid multiplets in the crystal nucleation, three short peptides REWD-16, REWDP-17 (containing charged doublets), and RADA-16 (alternating charged residues) were synthesized and characterized. The aggregation of these peptides in solution was investigated using circular dichroism, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, and dynamic light scattering experiments. The peptides REWD-16 and REWDP-17 induced the polycrystalline calcite crystal aggregates, whereas RADA-16 did not induce significant changes in calcite crystal morphology or aggregate formation in in vitro crystallization experiments. The lattice and morphology of the calcite crystals were characterized using X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope. The results discussed in this paper reveal the importance of multiplets of charged amino acid residues toward the nucleation of polycrystalline calcite crystal aggregates in solution.

1. The effect of daidzein, a naturally occurring phytoestrogen, on the reproductive performance of 120 female Zhedong White geese was determined. The geese were divided into 4 groups which were fed on diets containing 0 (Control), 10 (Da1), 20 (Da2) and 30 (Da3) mg daidzein per kg diet. Egg production and weight, fertility and hatchability rates, concentrations of estradiol (E2), triiodothyronine (T3), progesterone (P4), thyroxine (T4) and growth hormone (GH) in serum, and mRNA levels of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), β-follicle stimulating hormone (FSHβ), follicle stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), oestrogen receptor1 (ESR1), oestrogen receptor2 (ESR2), prolactin (PRL), prolactin receptor (PRLR), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPGA) were measured. 2. Daidzein increased egg weight and fertility but had no detectable effect on egg production and hatchability. 3. Daidzein affected serum P4 and GH concentrations and T4 rhythm, up-regulated GnRH mRNA and PRLR mRNA levels in the hypothalamus, down-regulated PRLR mRNA in the hypothalamus, PRL mRNA in the pituitary, and ESR2 mRNA levels in the ovary, respectively. The mRNA rhythms of PRLR in the hypothalamus, PRL, PRLR and FSHβ in the pituitary, FSHR, ESR1 and ESR2 in the ovary were significantly changed in the Da2 group. 4. It is suggested that an appropriate dose of daidzein might improve reproductive performance by affecting serum hormone concentrations and rhythms and regulating gene mRNA levels in the HPGA of female Zhedong White geese.

The aim of this study was to examine ganders at different stages of the reproductive season and the effect of: (1) diets with high phytoestrogen content and (2) in vitro phytoestrogen treatment on testosterone secretion by isolated Leydig cells. Thirty-six male Biłgoraj geese were fed control diets with low phytoestrogen content (containing grass meal) and diets with high phytoestrogens (containing alfalfa meal and soy). Testes were obtained from both groups of ganders at three different times of the breeding season: peak of reproductive activity (March), second half of reproductive activity (May) and beginning of photorefractoriness (July). Isolated Leydig cells were incubated with LH as well as genistein, daidzein, equol and coumestrol and the concentration of testosterone in the medium was determined by radioimmunoassay. The mean weight of testes from ganders in May and July decreased relative to their weights in March, but no significant differences among experimental groups were noted. No differences were observed in basal and LH-stimulated testosterone secretion by Leydig cells of ganders fed the control diets and the diets with higher phytoestrogen content. In July, LH did not stimulate testosterone secretion in either group. In vitro treatment with genistein, daidzein and equol (5 and 50 microM) inhibited basal and LH-stimulated testosterone production by Leydig cells from both groups. Coumestrol (5 and 50 microM) inhibited basal testosterone secretion only in March in the control group. Dietary exposure to phytoestrogens had a slight effect on in vitro testicular secretion in ganders. In vitro treatment with phytoestrogen inhibited testosterone production by Leydig cells. Genistein showed the strongest effect and coumestrol had the weakest influence on testicular secretion.

The stress that might result in animals from the routine handling that most experimental studies involve, e.g., weighing, injecting, and blood sampling, is usually assumed to be minimal when the animals look quiet. However, the intensity of this stress remains largely ignored. We have developed a system that allows blood samples to be taken from freely behaving geese without entering the animal room. In these entirely undisturbed geese, the humoral indexes of stress, i.e., blood levels of catecholamines, corticosterone, and lactate, were as low or even lower than the lowest values previously reported for birds. Remarkably, the mean basal values for epinephrine and norepinephrine were 90-fold and 5-fold, respectively, below the lowest values in the literature. Stress-induced variations in pH that would have concealed detection of nutrition-induced changes in pH were eliminated. In contrast, even though the birds looked quiet during a short 5-min routine handling procedure, to which they had been accustomed for weeks, there was a dramatic increase in the level of humoral indexes of stress. These increased severalfold within only 2 min, and the return to initial values could take up to 1 h. Acid-base balance was also disrupted. Thus, in studies on animals, the absence of stress cannot be deduced from only behavioral observations. Only a system for taking blood without human interference may enable stress-free investigations.

It has now been established that circovirus infection is common in farmed geese, but little is known about the clinicopathological significance of such infections. Ten clinically diseased geese suspected of being infected by circovirus were studied by in situ hybridization using a goose circovirus DNA probe. Circovirus DNA was demonstrated in the bursa of Fabricius (BF), spleen, thymus, bone marrow, liver, kidney, lung and heart, indicating that infection can be multisystemic. In some birds, virus DNA was present in very large quantities, most notably in the BF, liver and small intestine. With the exception of BF and thymus, there were no histological findings that would have suggested the presence of such quantities of circovirus DNA. In view of the very large quantities of virus DNA labelling present in some tissues, and by analogy to porcine circovirus type 2 infection and psittacine beak and feather virus infections, which are known to cause severe disease, and which have similar virus distribution to that found in our geese, it seems probable that the circovirus was important in the disease manifestations shown by the infected geese.

1. Enzyme activities were studied in blood plasma from Rhenish, Italian, Landes and Masseubian geese. 2. Strains used for liver production (Landes, Masseubian) showed higher activities of aspartate transaminase (AST) [EC 2.6.1.1], alanine transaminase (ALT) [EC 2.6.1.2] and fructose aldolase (FRA) [EC 4.1.2.13] while breeds with high egg production (Rhenish, Italian) had higher activities of both alkaline phosphatase (ALP) [EC 3.1.3.1] and acid phosphatase (ACP) [EC 3.1.3.2].

Sixteen geese were used to assess the movement of fluid and particulate digesta through their gastrointestinal tracts and to determine the diurnal variation in organic acid levels for the various segments of the tract. Fluid (polyethylene glycol and chronium-labeled ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) and particulate markers (2 and 5 mm long) were administered with the meal. Animals were killed at given intervals after the administration of markers. The gastrointestinal tract was divided into nine segments for measurement of markers, pH, volatile fatty acids (VFA), and lactic acid contents. The data indicated a rapid evacuation of fluid marker from the foregut (crop, ventriculus, and proventriculus), while particulate markers were retained for extended periods of time. Retention of fluid marker was observed only within the cecum. Retrograde movement of particulate marker was demonstrated from the duodenum to ventriculus and proventriculus. Retrograde movement of fluid marker was observed from the cloaca to the colon, cecum, and distal third of the small intestine. However, particulate marker showed no retrograde movement in these segments of tract. Highest VFA levels were observed in the cecum. Retention of digesta and production of VFA within the colon were less than those noted for the dog, pig and pony. Lactic acid comprised less than 10% of the organic acids present in the gastrointestinal tract and were at their highest levels in the proximal and mid small intestine.

By cloning and sequencing 3.4 kilobases of snow goose mtDNA we found that the ND5 gene is followed by the genes for cytochrome b, tRNA(Thr), tRNA(Pro), ND6, tRNA(Glu), the control region, tRNA(Phe), and srRNA. This order is identical to that of chicken, quail, and duck mtDNA but differs from that of mammals and a frog (Xenopus). The mean extent of difference due to base substitution between goose and chicken is generally closer to the same comparison between rat and mouse but less than that between human and cow. For one of the nine regions compared (tRNA(Glu)), the bird differences appear to be anomalous, possibly implicating altered functional constraints. Within the control region, several short sequences common to mammals are also conserved in the birds. Comparison of the goose control region with that of quail and chicken suggests that a sequence element with similarity to CSB-1 duplicated once prior to the divergence of goose and chicken and again on the lineage leading to chicken. Between goose (or duck) and chicken there are four times more transversions at the third positions of fourfold-degenerate codons in mitochondrial than in nuclear genes.

Canada geese (Branta canadensis) are prevalent in North America and may contribute to fecal pollution of water systems where they congregate. This work provides two novel real-time PCR assays (CGOF1-Bac and CGOF2-Bac) allowing for the specific and sensitive detection of Bacteroides 16S rRNA gene markers present within Canada goose feces.

Swimmer's itch (SI) or human cercarial dermatitis is caused by free-swimming larvae of bird parasites of the family Schistosomatidae (Trematoda) which have penetrated thorough the skin. Sometimes, mainly during first infections, the larvae do not cause any symptoms but if trapped by the immune system of the host each larva causes a maculopapular eruption. So far, five bird schistosome species have been reported in Iceland. Cercariae are shed by the freshwater snail Radix peregra but adults live in anseriform birds; one nasal Trichobilharzia species occurs in the nasal cavity of mallards, two visceral species have been found in veins of whooper swans and a visceral species has been found in greylag goose and in mallards, respectively. Experiments have shown that developing schistosomulae are able to survive for days or even weeks in mammals. Long term pathologic effects on the host are unknown. During the second half of August 2003 thousands of bathers got SI in a slowly streaming brook with geothermally heated groundwater in Landmannalaugar, the most frequently visited area in the interior of Iceland. The number of cercariae in the water and SI cases decreased until October but still in December and in late winter 2004 SI cases were reported. In August 2004 SI again started in the area but the density of cercariae in the water seemed to be less than in the previous year. The prevalence of snails shedding Trichobilharzia cercariae on the bathing site never exceeded 1%. The rapid increase of cercariae in the water by the middle of August in 2003 and 2004 were caused by a breeding mallard female and its ducklings which were raised on the bathing site during summer. All the ducklings had nasal- and visceral Trichobilharzia infections which they must have acquired soon after hatching. Three weeks later the adult worms could have started egg-laying. Consequently, emerging miracidia infected the snails which finally started shedding the cercariae by middle of August in 2003 and 2004. In future years this rapid increase of cercariae could be avoided if ducklings are not allowed to have access to the bathing site and the adjacent brook. Retrospective enquiries suggest that some visitors have occasionally got SI after bathing in the brook in preceding decades. Low number of papules, however, indicates a low density of cercariae in the water.

Heparin inhibited the hemagglutinin activity of Akabane and Aino viruses. The minimal inhibitory concentration of heparin required to inhibit 8 hemagglutination (HA) U of Akabane and Aino viruses was 10 U/ml. Goose erythrocytes failed to combine with the HA inhibitory factor of heparin. On the other hand, goose erythrocytes treated with heparinase had greatly reduced agglutinability by Akabane virus. Virus-heparin complex formation was observed by sedimenting heparin with the virus particles.

1. The nature and location of the receptors which stimulate salt-gland secretion in the goose have been investigated.2. The rapid injection of homologous blood (sufficient to raise the blood volume by 16 and 9%) into the right atrium failed to induce secretion. In contrast, hypertonic sucrose, Na(2)SO(4) and LiCl initiated secretion.3. These results support the theory that osmoreceptors initiate secretion by detecting an increase in plasma tonicity.4. The minimal amount of hypertonic NaCl required to initiate secretion when infusions were made into a carotid artery or into various arteries and veins in the splanchnic region was not less than that required by an I.V. route.5. Cross-circulation and perfusion studies also showed that a raised [NaCl] in the blood perfusing the head was ineffective in evoking secretion and thus that plasma tonicity must be raised elsewhere in the body.6. Secretion in response to salt-loading was abolished or prevented by cutting the vagus nerves or blocking them with local anaesthetic. Stimulation of the cephalic end of the cut vagi in an isolated, perfused decerebrate head induced secretion, indicating that the afferent fibres from the receptors to the C.N.S. lie in the vagus nerves. Cutting the vagi below the heart, however, had no effect on the secretory response.7. Blocking nerves in the crop with local anaesthetic had no effect on secretion induced by salt-loading but when local anaesthetic was injected into the pericardial sac, secretion decreased immediately, stopped, and recovered with a time course similar to that seen after blocking the vagus nerves.8. Section of the vagi in the neck abolished the tachycardia observed in response to the injection of hypertonic NaCl into the right atrium.9. As in other species, stimulation of the ;secretory nerve' induced secretion in anaesthetized or decerebrate geese.10. Hexamethonium given I.V. or applied topically to the ;secretory nerve ganglion' blocked secretion in response to salt-loading or to secretory nerve stimulation.11. It appears that the receptors for salt-gland secretion are located in or near the heart and that afferent fibres from these receptors travel in the vagus nerves to the C.N.S.12. A possible scheme of the secretory reflex which initiates and maintains salt-gland activity is proposed.

Global prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) constitutes a threat to human health. Goose is a unique model of NAFLD for discovering therapeutic targets as its liver can develop severe steatosis without overt injury. Fatty acid desaturase (Fads) is a potential therapeutic target as Fads expression and mutations are associated with liver fat. Here, we hypothesized that Fads was promoted to provide a protection for goose fatty liver. To test this, goose Fads1 and Fads2 were sequenced. Fads1/2/6 expression was determined in goose liver and primary hepatocytes by quantitative PCR. Liver fatty acid composition was also analyzed by gas chromatography. Data indicated that hepatic Fads1/2/6 expression was gradually increased with the time of overfeeding. In contrast, trans-C18:1n9 fatty acid (Fads inhibitor) was reduced. However, enhanced Fads capacity for long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) synthesis was not sufficient to compensate for the depleted LC-PUFAs in goose fatty liver. Moreover, cell studies showed that Fads1/2/6 expression was regulated by fatty liver-associated factors. Together, these findings suggest Fads1/2 as protective components are promoted to meet instant need for LC-PUFAs in goose fatty liver, and we propose this is required for severe hepatic steatosis without liver injury.

In this study, we investigated the role of liver X receptor (LXR) activation in hepatic assembly and in the secretion of very low density lipoprotein-triglycerides in goose primary hepatocytes. Goose primary hepatocytes were isolated and treated with the LXR agonist T0901317. Total triglyceride accumulation, intracellular and extracellular triglyceride concentrations, extracellular very low density lipoprotein concentration, and gene expression levels of LXRα, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, acyl coenzyme A:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) 1, and DGAT2 were measured in primary hepatocytes. We found a dose-dependent upregulation of total and intracellular TG accumulation when using 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 μM T0901317, but the extracellular triglyceride and very low density lipoprotein concentrations were dose dependent only when the T0901317 concentration was below 1 μM; as compared with 1 μM T0901317, 10 μM T0901317 had an inhibiting effect (P < 0.05). The mRNA levels of all the detected genes increased in the presence of T0901317. The change in LXRα and DGAT1 was dose dependent, and the mRNA levels of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and DGAT2 increased with a T0901317 concentration up to 1 μM, but decreased when treated with 10 μM T0901317 (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the secretion of very low density lipoprotein plays a role in pharmacologically activating the LXR-induced development of hepatocellular steatosis in geese.

goose parvovirus (GPV) belongs to the Dependoparvovirus genus in Parvovirinae subfamily within Parvoviridae family, is the etiological agent of Derzsy's disease. Nuclear localization signal (NLS) is important for parvovirus lifecycle in the delivery of genomes and the structural protein of progeny virus into the nucleus. Here, NLS was first identified in GPV. By using the PSORT II program, a basic region (BR, 160YPVVKKPKLTEE171) in the N-terminus of VP1 was found, which predicted as putative NLS motif of goose parvovirus capsid. The GPV BR could transfer both small reporter proteins (EGFP) and large reporter protein (β-galactosidase) into the nucleus by Immunofluorescence assay. Furthermore, the K164A, or K165A, or K167A substitutions mutation of GPV VP1 did abolish its nuclear localization, suggesting that the 164 K, 165 K and 167 K residues in the 160YPVVKKPKLTEE171 are required for its for nuclear import. Our finding may help us to gain a better understand of GPV lifecycle.

1. The incorporation of [3H]thymidine into salt-gland DNA has been studied in vivo and in vitro during adaptation of birds to salt water. 2. No increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation in vivo was apparent in birds on salt water for 0.25 and 1 day compared with those on fresh water. However, by 2 days there was a marked increase. At 7 and 14 days, incorporation was again low but by these later stages the DNA content of the glands was significantly increased. 3. Increased incorporation of [3H]thymidine was also evident in salt-gland slices incubated in vitro from birds on salt water for 2 or 4 days, but not for 14 days, compared with those on fresh water. 4. It is concluded that hyperplasia, as well as the hypertrophy demonstrated previously, occurs as part of the over-all adaptive response of the salt glands during the continual ingestion of salt water, but that the time course of the two processes is different. 5. In geese with one salt gland removed, no indication of compensatory growth of the remaining gland was evident in birds kept on fresh water for 24 days. In such birds on salt water for 14 days, some compensatory growth occurred but, as judged by measurements of DNA, RNA and protein, this could be ascribed to hypertrophy.

Bismuth shotshells have been approved as a "nontoxic" alternative to lead in North America. Approval was based on a limited number of studies; even background levels of bismuth in wildfowl were unknown. We report on the concentration of bismuth (and lead) in muscle and liver tissues of wildfowl (Anas platyrhynchos, Anas acuta, Anas crecca, Branta canadensis, Chen caerulescens) harvested with lead shotshell. Average liver-bismuth levels detected in the present study (e.g., teal, 0.05 microg/g dw; mallard, 0.09 microg/g dw) suggest analytical error in other studies examining the effects of bismuth in birds. Significant positive relationships between bismuth- and lead-tissue levels for muscle when all species were combined (and for B. canadensis and C. caerulescens separately) can be explained by noting that bismuth is a contaminant of lead. Thus, more research is recommended to confirm the appropriateness of bismuth as a "nontoxic" shot alternative.

In this study, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of the proteomic profile of the pituitary gland of the Huoyan goose during the laying period compared to the pre-laying period using an iTRAQ-based approach. Protein samples were prepared from pituitary gland tissues of nine pre-laying period and nine laying period geese. Then the protein samples from three randomly selected geese within each period were pooled in equal amounts to generate one biological sample pool. We identified 684 differentially expressed proteins, including 418 up-regulated and 266 down-regulated proteins. GO annotation and KEGG pathway analyses of these proteins were conducted. Some of these proteins were found to be associated with hormone and neurotransmitter secretion and transport, neuropeptide signalling and GnRH signalling pathways, among others. Subsequently, the modification of the abundance of three proteins (prolactin, chromogranin-A and ITPR3) was verified using western blotting. Our results will provide a new source for mining genes and gene products related to the egg-laying performance of Huoyan geese, and may provide important information for the conservation and utilization of local goose breeds.

Self-facilitation through ecosystem engineering (i.e., organism modification of the abiotic environment) and consumer-resource interactions are both major determinants of spatial patchiness in ecosystems. However, interactive effects of these two mechanisms on spatial complexity have not been extensively studied. We investigated the mechanisms underlying a spatial mosaic of low-tide exposed hummocks and waterlogged hollows on an intertidal mudflat in the Wadden Sea dominated by the seagrass Zostera noltii. A combination of field measurements, an experiment and a spatially explicit model indicated that the mosaic resulted from localized sediment accretion by seagrass followed by selective waterfowl grazing. Hollows were bare in winter, but were rapidly colonized by seagrass during the growth season. Colonized hollows were heavily grazed by brent geese and widgeon in autumn, converting these patches to a bare state again and disrupting sediment accretion by seagrass. In contrast, hummocks were covered by seagrass throughout the year and were rarely grazed, most likely because the waterfowl were not able to employ their preferred but water requiring feeding strategy ('dabbling') here. Our study exemplifies that interactions between ecosystem engineering by a foundation species (seagrass) and consumption (waterfowl grazing) can increase spatial complexity at the landscape level.

Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is an endogenous peptide showing a rich profile of biological activities. Within ovaries, VIP directly regulates the ovarian functions, including granulosa cells (GCs) development. In the present study, the effects of VIP on proliferation and apoptosis in goose granulosa cells were demonstrated and its underlying mechanism investigated. A strategy of RNAi-mediated "gene silencing" of Bcl-2 (RV-Bcl-2), over-expression of Bcl-2 (JLV-Bcl-2) synthesis, and exogenous VIP was used to treat goose GCs. The results showed the amounts of Bcl-2 protein were negatively correlated with apoptosis of goose GCs in all experimental groups. Compared with other control groups, apoptosis was decreased in goose GCs following treatment of 100 nM VIP, and the amount of Bcl-2 protein was increased (P < 0.05) increased. However, VIP failed to exert an effect on cell proliferation (P > 0.05). In conclusion, the exogenous VIP plays an important role in inhibiting apoptosis of goose GCs via inducing Bcl-2 gene expression.

Riemerella anatipestifer causes infectious serositis of ducks and geese. The genomic diversity of R. anatipestifer associated with outbreaks in waterfowls was studied using 24 multidrug-resistant R. anatipestifer isolates collected from the visceral organs of ducks and geese from seven outbreaks in four goose farms and one outbreak in one duck farm. Seven methods were used to differentiate these isolates. Plasmid patterns differed in plasmid number and size, ranging from 2.9 kb to 20 kb, and provided seven profiles. Divergent nucleotide sequences (predominant in 670 to 830 base pairs) of the ompA gene categorized the 24 isolates into three groups based on cluster analysis and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Repetitive-sequence polymerase chain reaction and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis revealed the highest genotypic variations among the isolates. Genotypes and serotypes differed among farms and within the same farm and even within a single goose. In conclusion, a difference in R. anatipestifer genotypes and serotypes was observed for multiple outbreaks in waterfowls.

Parvovirus infection of Muscovy ducks caused by a genetically and antigenically distinct virus has been reported from Germany, France, Israel, Hungary, some Asian countries and the USA. The pathological changes include those of degenerative skeletal muscle myopathy and myocarditis, hepatitis, sciatic neuritis and polioencephalomyelitis. In the study presented here, day-old and 3-week-old goslings and Muscovy ducks were infected experimentally with three different parvovirus strains (isolates of D-216/4 from the classical form of Derzsy's disease, D-190/3 from the enteric form of Derzsy's disease, and strain FM from the parvovirus disease of Muscovy ducks). All three parvovirus strains caused severe disease in both day-old and 3-week-old Muscovy ducks but in the goslings only the two strains of goose origin (D-216/4 and D-190/3) caused disease with high (90-100%) mortality when infection was performed at day old. Strain FM (of Muscovy duck origin) did not cause any clinical signs or pathological lesions in the goslings. In the day-old goslings and Muscovy ducks the principal pathological lesions were severe enteritis with necrosis of the epithelial cells (enterocytes) of the mucous membrane and the crypts of Lieberkühn, and the formation of intranuclear inclusion bodies. Other prominent lesions included hepatitis and atrophy (lymphocyte depletion) of the lymphoid organs (bursa of Fabricius, thymus, spleen). In goslings infected with the strain originating from the classical form of Derzsy's disease mild myocarditis was also detected. After infection at three weeks of age, growth retardation, feathering disorders, myocardial lesions (degeneration of cardiac muscle cells, lympho-histiocytic infiltration) and hepatitis were the most prominent lesions in both geese and Muscovy ducks. In addition to the lesions observed in the geese, muscle fibre degeneration, mild sciatic neuritis and polioencephalomyelitis were also observed in the Muscovy ducks infected with any of the three parvovirus strains.

A recently published method for measuring human haemoglobin based on alkaline haematin (Zander et al., Clin. chem. Acta 136, 83-93, 1984) has been adopted for bird samples. The new method yields comparable haemoglobin values with that of a previously used alkaline haematin method. Levels of haemoglobin estimated using alkaline haematin were higher than for cyanhaemiglobin, the reference method for human haemoglobin. This difference is due to the loss of haemoglobin in the cyanhaemiglobin procedure due to insolubility. The values for haemoglobin found by the alkaline haematin method did not vary significantly between a range of bird species. The method overcomes some important deficiencies of the cyanhaemiglobin method, in particular, problems of turbidity and quality control assessment.

Studies of a zwitterionic buffer formulated for cell electrophoresis were done using the McDonnell-Douglas Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System. Standard buffers were analyzed for their stability in the electrical field and the results showed that both buffers tested were inherently unstable. Further, titration studies showed that the standards buffers buffered poorly at the pH employed for electrophoresis. The zwitterionic buffer buffered well at its nominal pH and was shown to be stable in the electrical field. Comparative studies of the buffer with standard cell separation buffers using formalin fixed rabbit and goose red blood cells showed that the zwitterionic buffer gave better resolution of the fixed cells. Studies with viable hybridoma cells showed that buffer Q supported cell viability equal to Hank's Balanced Salt Solution and that hybridoma cells in different stages of the growth cycle demonstrated reproducible differences in electrophoretic mobility.

In the current study, four novel avian β-defensins (AvBDs) (AvBD2, 5, 9, and 10) were identified in tissues from the Chinese goose (Anser cygnoides). The antibacterial activity of the AvBDs showed that all of these AvBDs exhibited antibacterial activity against most of the bacteria investigated (P<0.01). In addition, antibacterial activity of all of the AvBDs against Staphylococcus aureus and Pasteurella multocida decreased significantly or was completely abolished at 150mM NaCl (P<0.01). None of the AvBDs showed hemolytic activity. AvBD2 and AvBD10 were expressed widely, whereas AvBD5 and AvBD9 mRNAs were expressed in a limited number of geese tissues. AvBD9 was significantly induced in some immune tissues from geese after Salmonella enteritidis infection. The others were significantly upregulated in small intestine and some immune tissues of the geese (P<0.01). The present results suggest that the AvBDs are part of the host defense mechanism of the goose.

Yolks in embryonated eggs from duck, goose, herring gull, and various breeds of chicken were injected with 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (TCB). Hens' eggs were injected after 4 days of incubation and eggs from the other species were injected after 5 days of incubation. All breeds of chicken tested were very sensitive to TCB. At a dose of 20 micrograms/kg egg the death rate in chick embryos ranged from 70 to 100% at the end of the experiment by Day 18 of incubation. Liver lesions, hydropericardium, subcutaneous edema, shortened beak, and microphthalmia were found in both dead and living TCB-treated chick embryos. Embryos of the other species tested were considerably less sensitive than chick embryos to TCB. The highest dose administered to these species was 5,000 micrograms/kg egg for ducks and 1,000 micrograms/kg egg for geese and herring gulls. These doses did not affect the viability of the embryos and caused no gross abnormalities.

Respiratory properties of whole blood during development were studied in embryos of the bar-headed and Canada geese. In both species, affinity of the blood for O2 [expressed as O2 half-saturation pressure (P50)] increased with development, to a low and stable value. The low and stable P50 at pH 7.4 for the bar-headed goose, 20.1 +/- 0.3 Torr, is significantly lower than that for the Canada goose, 26.9 +/- 0.8 Torr. The data suggest a higher Bohr effect for the bar-headed goose. Hill's coefficients, buffering capacity, red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, and blood hemoglobin concentrations are similar in both species. We suggest that the affinity of the whole blood for O2 is an important genetically based adaptation to ensure a high O2 content in the blood in the face of reductions in ambient PO2 associated with nesting at high altitudes. The higher Bohr effect may ensure high tissue PO2 in the presence of the high-affinity hemoglobin.

Within a 4-year surveillance period for influenza A virus in pelagic birds, 351 influenza A strains were isolated from the trachea or cloaca of 3344 apparently healthy ducks, gulls, swans, terns and geese. The isolated influenza A viruses represent 14 subtypes. Their haemagglutinins (HA) were mainly related to avian HA, but also to the human HA H2 and to the swine HA Hswl. The neuraminidases (NA) were identified as avian, equine and human NA. The isolated influenza A strains include fowl plague-like viruses Havl Neql, strains with the surface antigen Hswl Nav4 and the subtype Hav7 Navl isolated from unconcentrated water samples. A subtype unknown to date, with the antigen formula H2 Nav4, was isolated from ducks. 8.2% of pekin ducks showed dual infections.

Domestic fowl, ducks, geese, Guinea-fowl, quail and pigeons were anaesthetised with intravenous pentabarbitone sodium. Carbonised microspheres (40,000-60,000), 15 micrometer +/- 5 micrometer in diameter and labelled with 85Sr (3M Company) were injected into the cannulated right atrium. After spontaneous breathing of room air the birds were killed and the radioactivity measured in the spleen, kidneys, brain, lungs and extrapulmonary primary bronchi. Small pieces of lung tissue were removed from the beginning (costal region), middle (costovertebral region), and the end (vertebral region) of the paleopulmonic parabronchi, in the direction of air flow. Microspheres found in samples of parabronchial tissue indicated the relative perfusion rates of the three regions. Thermal panting was induced in six domestic fowl and six pigeons, followed by injection of microspheres. No arteriovenous anastomoses were found to exist across the pulmonary bed in any of the species examined at rest or in the panting domestic fowl and pigeons. The extrapulmonary primary bronchus was found to be well perfused from the pulmonary artery in the domestic fowl and to a lesser extent in the other species. The perfusion of the parabronchi in the domestic fowl and pigeons at rest decreased in the direction of ventilatory gas flow. This blood flow gradient was significantly increased during thermal panting in the domestic fowl, but not in the pigeon.

Optimal conditions of radial haemolysis in gel (HIG) with Chikungunya (Chik) and Japanese encephalitis (JE) viruses were developed and compared with those of rubella virus. Sheep erythrocytes were found preferable for HIG with Chik and JE viruses, unlike rubella virus, where goose erythrocytes gave best results. Rooster erythrocytes were completely negative in the Chik and JE HIG, again differing from rubella virus, which was practically as good with rooster as with goose erythrocytes. Sheep erythrocytes with rubella virus gave incomplete reactions in HIG. Sensitization of erythrocytes with JE and Chik viruses is better, when borate-phosphate, and not phosphate buffer, is used. Optimum pH values for both viruses should be regarded. Sucrose-acetone, freon and borate-saline antigens from infected mice brain may be used for HIG with Chik and JE viruses.

The issue of food insecurity affects millions of people in the United States every year. Often these people rely on soup kitchens, food banks, and shelters for proper meals, and these organizations often depend on donations to meet needs. One of the most limited food resources is meat. To help alleviate this problem, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services donates more than 60 tons of wild game (deer, moose, feral hogs, goats, geese, and ducks) to a variety of charitable organizations each year. Although commercially produced meat routinely undergoes screening for contaminants, potential exposure to environmental contaminants from eating wild game is not well characterized. In this study, the concentration of 17 contaminants of concern in the breast meat of wild geese was examined. These concentrations were then used in a probabilistic model to estimate potential risk associated with consumption of this meat. Based on model predictions, more than 99 % of all adults were below exposure limits for all of the compounds tested. For all consumer age classes modeled, consumption of wild goose meat may expose a small fraction of these populations to levels of lead higher than the recommended exposure limits. Similarly, mercury exposure was predicted to be higher than the recommended limits when the meat was served as steaks. This information about concentrations of contaminants of concern in goose meat and potential exposures associated with meat consumption based on probabilistic models will enable others to make informed decisions about the risks associated with the consumption of wild meat.

Salmonella enterica causes a number of significant poultry diseases and is also a major pathogen in humans. Most poultry infected by Salmonella become carriers; infection may also be fatal, depending on the particular serovar and the age of the bird at infection. Younger birds are more susceptible to infection by Salmonella, so it is critical that hatcheries monitor birds. We developed a method to use hatched eggshell membranes (HEM) to assess contamination by Salmonella in poultry hatching cabinets and to evaluate the prevalence of Salmonella in a goose hatchery and rearing farm. Comparison of the Salmonella isolation rate in hatching cabinets using 3 sampling methods showed that the highest Salmonella contamination was detected in HEM, and that these results differed significantly from those obtained from fluff samples and cabinet swab samples (P < 0.05). Analysis of HEM was also used to evaluate Salmonella contamination in goose, chicken, and duck hatcheries. The lowest Salmonella-positive rate was found for the chicken hatchery, followed by the goose and the duck hatcheries (P < 0.05). Six serogroups of Salmonella were detected in the 3 hatcheries: A, B, C1, C2, D, and E. The distribution of these serogroups differed among the hatcheries. Salmonella serogroup C1 was the major serogroup found in geese, compared with serogroup B in chickens and ducks. However, Salmonella Typhimurium was dominant in 1 goose hatchery and also in geese from this hatchery that had been transferred to a farm. Antibiotic susceptibility analysis showed that Salmonella Typhimurium strains isolated from the farm geese with diarrhea showed significantly higher resistance to doxycycline, colistin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprin, and cephalothin than those isolated from the hatchery (P < 0.05). Therefore, HEM as a detection target can be used to monitor Salmonella contamination in hatching cabinets and also be used to assess Salmonella prevalence in poultry hatcheries and rearing farms.

This article reports the complete nucleotide sequences of four duck circovirus (DuCV) isolates from sick ducks in Taiwan and development of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection and differentiation of goose circovirus (GoCV) and DuCV. Sequence comparison showed that Taiwanese DuCV isolates had 82.5%-83.8% nucleotide sequence identity to the German and North American DuCV isolates. This is the first report on the presence of DuCV and its associated diseases outside Germany. A PCR test was developed using a universal primer pair based on conserved sequences present in the genomes of GoCV and DuCV. This PCR test could detect and differentiate between GoCV and DuCV by the size of PCR product each virus produced (256 bp for GoCV and 228 bp for DuCV). Application of this PCR test to samples of bursa of Fabricius from sick birds in the field showed that 9 of 26 goose samples contained GoCV, while 13 of 34 duck samples contained DuCV. This PCR test could serve as a fast and sensitive method for detection and differentiation of DuCV and GoCV.

Goose is an economically important herbivore waterfowl supplying nutritious meat and eggs, high-quality liver fat, and feathers. However, biogeograhpy of the gut microbiome of goose remains limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the microbiota inhabiting 7 different gastrointestinal locations (proventriculus, gizzard, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and rectum) of 180-day-old geese and the short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) of their metabolites based on 16S rRNA gene sequences and gas chromatography, respectively. Consequently, 3,886,340 sequences were identified into 29 phyla and 359 genera. Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, and Actinobacteria were the major phyla, in which Bacteroidetes (28%) and Fusobacteria (0.8%) in the cecum were significantly higher than those in other sections (∼4.4 and 0.1%, respectively). In addition, Cyanobacteria in the gizzard (4.9%) was significantly higher than those in other gut sections except the proventriculus (2.4%). At the genus level, Bacteroides was the most dominant group in the cecum at 23.7%, which was much more than those in the 6 other sections (less than 4.6%). Moreover, Faecalibacterium and Butyricicoccus were significantly high in the cecum (P < 0.05). Results of SCFA showed that acetic and butyric acids in the cecum were significantly higher than those in the 6 other sections (P < 0.05); this result was consistent with the high abundance of Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Prevotella, and Butyricicoccus in the cecum. Additionally, isobutyric, isovaleric, and valeric acids were found only in the cecum. The different microbial compositions among the 7 gastrointestinal locations might be a cause and consequence of gut functional differences. All these results could offer some information for future study of the relationship between gastrointestinal microbiota and the ability of fiber utilization and adaptability.

Eight axenic strains of Tetratrichomonas gallinarum were isolated from the caeca or cloacae of ducks and geese. Different growth curves were determined for each of the strains and the generation times were calculated, ranging from 2 h 36 min to 4 h 44 min. The axenic cultures of seven T. gallinarium strains were subjected to the Honigberg test on inbred mice. The average volumes of the six-day-old subcutaneous abscesses ranged from 129.98 to 185.63 mm3. Selected strains of trichomonads were used for experimental infection of ducks and geese. Neither the macroscopis examination nor the microscopic analysis did find any greater pathological changes in the mucosa of the caecum of the birds, though the Trichomonas organisms were observed in large quantities among the villi in the crypts. It is believed on the basis of the results that the species T. gallinarium carries no primary pathogenicity to the specific hosts.

The conservation of genetic resources of avian species has become increasingly important over the past decade. The aim of the present study was to develop a genome preservation technique for the Hungarian goose Anser anser domestica. To this end, we developed a novel approach combining the simplicity of isolating a blastodermal cell suspension, which includes forming primordial germ cells (PGCs), with the efficiency of targeting future gonads by injecting these cells into the cardiac vein of the developing host embryo. First, we determined that the migratory period of PGCs in goose embryos was between 69 and 84h of development. Then, we injected the blastodermal cell suspension into the bloodstream of recipient embryos at this stage of development and monitored donor cell transmission into the genital tract. In all, 249 embryos were injected; three were found to be chimeras in gonadal tissues, whereas only one was a chimera in other tissues. Based on these results, it is concluded that this method is suitable for producing chimeras in the domestic goose. The optimal time of cell injection was found to be between 74 and 76h. The present study is the first report of the generation of chimeras in the domestic goose using intracardiac transplantation of embryonic cells.

Immunoglobulin Y (abbreviated as IgY) is a type of immunoglobulin that is the major antibody in bird, reptile, and lungfish blood. IgY consists of two light (λ) and two heavy (υ) chains. In the present study, polyclonal antibody against IgYFc was generated and evaluated. rIgYCυ3/Cυ4 was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and utilized to raise polyclonal antibody in rabbit. High affinity antisera were obtained, which successfully detected the antigen at a dilution of 1:204,800 for ELISA assay. The antibody can specifically recognize both rIgYCυ3/Cυ4 and native IgY by Western bolt analysis. Furthermore, the serum of Grus japonensis or immunoglobulin of chicken, duck, turkey, and silkie samples and dynamic changes of serum GoIgY after immunogenicity with GPV-VP3-virus-like particles (GPV-VP3-VLPs) can be detected with the anti-GoIgYFc polyclonal antibody. These results suggested that the antibody is valuable for the investigation of biochemical properties and biological functions of GoIgY.

Free-living waterfowl residing in metropolitan parks in central Ohio were surveyed for the fecal shedding and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., and Pasteurella multocida. In addition, a survey for intestinal parasites was also conducted in these same waterfowl to determine parasite burdens in free-living waterfowl. Prevalences of 67%, 50%, and 0.2% of E. coli, C. jejuni, and Salmonella spp., respectively, were observed for all waterfowl species. Pasteurella multocida was not isolated from the sampled population. Salmonella java was isolated from one mallard duck. Statistically, there was a significantly higher E. coli isolation rate for mallard ducks than for Canada geese, but no difference was observed for C. jejuni isolation rates between waterfowl species. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted via the disk diffusion method and multidrug resistance was exhibited for penicillin G, lincomycin, vancomycin, erythromycin, and bacitracin. In addition, the prevalence of endoparasites in these sampled waterfowl ranged from 5% to 66%. Protozoan oocysts were most prevalent followed by nematode ova. No trematode or cestode ovum was recovered from this sampled population.

Canada geese (Branta canadensis) showing symptoms of lead poisoning were collected from their natural habitat, and their pectoralis muscle was examined for ultrastructural changes. Both the red and white fibre types showed pathological changes. In some red fibres, there were prominent accumulations of glycogen granules, occasionally membrane-bound, at certain spots, and of lipid droplets. Glycogen and lipid were also located within mitochondria. When lipid droplets were sparse in a certain fibre, occurrence of fused mitochondria often with distorted cristae, was observed. Swollen mitochondria with disrupted cristae and dense intramitochondrial inclusions were present. Lysosomes and areas of mitochondrial degeneration were also seen. Dilatation of the terminal cisternae of the sacroplasmic reticulum and of the T-system was also observed in the red fibres. In the white fibres, enormous accumulations of glycogen granules were present and the cristae of mitochondria were often disrupted. In some white fibres the triads and Z-lines were in a state of severe disarray. The nuclei in both the fibre types appeared to be normal and did not contain the typical intranuclear inclusion bodies present in kidney and liver cells of lead poisoned animals and humans. It is suggested that, in the goose, lead has a diabetogenic effect, which in the breast muscle, is manifested in the large accumulations of glycogen and the disruption of glycolytic metabolism. Lead poisoning also affects mitochondrial structure and function leading to adverse effects on oxidative metabolism in the muscle.

The study was undertaken to assess dietary CP and ME concentrations for optimum growth performance and carcass characteristics of goslings. In a 5 x 3 factorial arrangement, 360 one-day-old commercial generation Huoyan goslings were randomly assigned to experimental diets with 10.87, 11.37, 11.87, 12.37, and 12.87 MJ of ME/kg of diet; each contained 15.0, 17.5, and 20.0% CP, respectively, from 0 to 4 wk of age (WOA). Each dietary treatment was replicated 6 times. Body weight and feed consumption were measured, and carcass characteristics were evaluated at 4 WOA. The result showed that birds on a diet with 11.87, 12.37, and 12.87 MJ of ME/kg at 0 to 4 WOA exhibited greater BW gain than those on a diet with 10.87 and 11.37 MJ of ME/kg (P < 0.01), though BW gain was not different among 11.87, 12.37, and 12.87 MJ of ME/kg of diet. Mean BW gain of birds fed 17.5 and 20.0% CP diets was not different (P > 0.05), but they were higher than those on 15.0% dietary CP concentration (P < 0.001). Feed intake was not influenced by dietary ME levels (P > 0.05). Feed intake of birds fed 17.5 and 20.0% CP diets was higher than those of birds on 15.0% CP diets (P < 0.01). Feed conversion ratios of birds fed on 11.87, 12.37, and 12.87 MJ of ME/kg of diet were better than those fed on 10.87 and 11.37 MJ of ME/kg (P < 0.001). Feed conversion ratios of birds fed on 17.5 and 20.0% CP diets were better than those fed on 15.0% CP diets. Moreover, there were no significant interactions between CP and ME on growth performance. There was a direct relationship between dietary ME levels and eviscerated carcass percentage, abdominal fat percentage, and liver relative weight (P < 0.01). Breast and leg meat percentage were influenced by dietary CP concentrations significantly (P < 0.001). Thus, diets with 11.87 MJ of ME/kg and 17.5 to 20.0% CP were used more efficiently from 0 to 4 WOA by Huoyan goslings.

Estimation of trade-offs between current reproduction and future survival and fecundity of long-lived vertebrates is essential to understanding factors that shape optimal reproductive investment. Black brant geese (Branta bernicla nigricans) fledge more goslings, on average, when their broods are experimentally enlarged to be greater than the most common clutch size of four eggs. Thus, we hypothesized that the lesser frequency of brant clutches exceeding four eggs results, at least partially, from a future reduction in survival, breeding probability, or clutch size for females tending larger broods. We used an 8-year mark-recapture data set (Barker robust design) with 5 years of clutch and brood manipulations to estimate long-term consequences of reproductive decisions in brant. We did not find evidence of a trade-off between reproductive effort and true survival or future initiation date and clutch size. Rather, future breeding probability was maximized ( 0.92±0.03 [SE]) for manipulated females tending broods of four goslings and was lower for females tending smaller (one gosling; 0.63±0.09 [SE]) or larger (seven goslings; 0.52±0.15 [SE]) broods. Our results suggest that demographic trade-offs for female brant tending large broods may reduce the fitness value of clutches larger than four and, therefore, contribute to the paucity of larger clutches. The lack of a trade-off between reproductive effort and survival provides evidence that survival, to which fitness is most sensitive in long-lived animals, is buffered against temporal variation in brant.

A benign Newcastle disease virus (NDV) recently became highly virulent during replication in domestic chickens. It is still unclear whether NDVs circulating among wild waterfowl also have the potential to become highly pathogenic (velogenic) in chickens. To demonstrate experimentally the generation of velogenic NDV from a nonpathogenic waterfowl isolate, we passaged an avirulent goose isolate in chickens. After nine consecutive passages by air-sac inoculation, followed by five passages in chick brain, the virus became highly virulent in chickens, producing a 100% mortality rate, and demonstrating typical velogenic properties in pathogenicity tests. Sequence analysis at the fusion protein cleavage site showed that the original isolate contained the typical avirulent type sequence, E-R-Q-E-R/L, which progressed incrementally to a typical virulent type, K-R-Q-K-R/F, during repeated passage in chickens. These results demonstrate that avirulent viruses, maintained in wild waterfowl in nature and bearing the consensus avirulent type sequence, have the potential to become velogenic after transmission to and circulation in chicken populations. The results also suggest that chickens provide a mechanism for the selection of virulent viruses from an avirulent background.

A low laying performance in goose is one of the key factors preventing the industrial development, and the laying performance is related to broody behavior. However, the characteristics of broody behavior in geese remain unclear. In this study, the total 144 geese (300 day old), including Zhedong geese (Anser cygnoides), Sichuan geese (Anser cygnoides), and Carlos geese (Anser anser) were selected and assigned to 1 of 3 groups/breed (including 4♂+12♀). Laying and broody behaviors were recorded using the infrared video cameras from 2016 November 11 to 2017 June 15. The broody behavior was detected in 19.4% of Carlos geese, 33.3% of Sichuan geese, and 100% of Zhedong geese. Different goose breeds showed similar behavior characteristics. The low frequency of feeding, drinking, and low body weight were observed in the middle of broodiness. As the brooding progressed, the body temperature showed a downward trend and then recovered, whereas no difference was observed in Carlos goose. In addition, the plasma hormone concentration from different breeds and stages of broodiness were compared. The contents of FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) and LH (luteinizing hormone) in geese were greater in the laying stage than that in the broody stage. Fewer FSH and LH were detected in Zhedong geese and Carlos geese, more in Sichuan geese. In broody goose, the PRL (prolactin) concentrations of the 3 goose breeds peaked in the middle of broodiness, and greater PRL was detected in Sichuan geese than those in Carlos geese and Zhedong geese. Finally, we compared egg production between the broody and non-broody geese in the observation period. The egg production of broody Carlos geese was 27, which was significantly higher than non-broody geese (14 eggs), while in Sichuan geese there was no significant difference between broody (24 eggs) and non-broody geese (26 eggs). Finally, the higher egg production was found with the more broody times in Zhedong geese. Taken together, although the different goose breeds showed similar broody behavior characteristics, the broody rate and hormone secretion were dissimilar, and the Zhedong geese exhibited strong broody feature.

Avian orthoreovirus (ARV) has been considered as a significant pathogen causing great infectious diseases to the avian, like broiler and waterfowl. The genome of this novel ARV(Reo/SDPY/Goose) was completely sequenced by next-generation sequencing. The complete genome was found to be 23517 bp in length with 10 segments. Although the Reo/SDPY/Goose was isolated from the gosling, it shares great similarity, no matter which segment within the genome, with those published as avian-origin reovirus. Genomic analysis revealed that this virus was distinct from published ARV strains and met criteria to become a novel ARV strain.

The aim of this investigation was to study the connection between body size, fatty acid composition and sensitivity to lipid peroxidation of heart mitochondria and microsomes isolated from different size bird species: manon (Lonchura striata), quail (Coturnix coturnix var japonica), pigeon (Columba livia), duck (Cairina moschata) and goose (Anser anser), representing a 372-fold range of body mass. Fatty acids of total lipids were determined using gas chromatography and lipid peroxidation was evaluated with a chemiluminescence assay. The fatty acids present in heart organelles of the different bird species analyzed showed a small number of significant allometric trends. In mitochondria, from the individual fatty acid data, palmitoleic acid (C16:1 n7) increased allometrically (r=0.878), while stearic acid (C18:0) was negatively related to body mass (r=-0.903). Interestingly, none of the calculated fatty acid variables, the average fatty acid saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated (PUFA) and the unsaturation index (UI) was established to show significant body size-related variations. In heart microsomes, the content of C18:0 was significantly smaller (r=-0.970) in the birds of greater size. A significant allometric increase in linoleic acid (C18:2 n6) (r=0.986), polyunsaturated (r=0.990) and UI (r=0.904) was observed in the larger birds. The total n6 fatty acids of heart mitochondria did not show significant differences when it was correlated to body mass of the birds. Moreover, positive allometric relationships were shown for microsomes. The total n3 fatty acids of heart mitochondria and microsomes indicated no significant correlations to body mass of birds. The C16:1 n7, C18:0 in mitochondria and C18:0, C18:2 n6, PUFA, UI and PUFA n6 in microsomes showed significant differences when they were correlated to maximum life span (MLSP) of birds. As light emission=chemiluminescence originated from heart organelles was not statistically significant, a lack of correlation between the sensitivity to lipid peroxidation and body size or maximum life span was obtained. These results indicate that the high resistance of bird hearts to the attack by free radicals is body size-independent and would be related to the preservation of cardiac function.

Delta-crystallin is the major structural protein in avian and reptilian eye lenses but its sequence is highly homologous with the urea cycle enzyme, argininosuccinate lyase (ASL). In previous studies the multi-step unfolding process of this protein in the presence of GdmCl was sensitively probed using tryptophan fluorescence. In this study the contribution of single tryptophan residues to the stability of the local environment was monitored by mutation of two highly conservative tryptophan residues in goose delta-crystallin, Trp 74 and Trp 169. These residues behaved differently in terms of fluorescence intensity and maxima emission wavelength, consistent with their structural location in buried or solvent accessible regions. No gross changes in the secondary structure after mutation were observed, as judged by far-UV CD. The side chains of tryptophan residues in the structure of wild-type goose delta-crystallin possess both hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions. Replacement of the side chain with phenylalanine or alanine led to expose of a hydrophobic area and a reduction in thermal stability; W169A particularly has a T(m) value that was 10 degrees C lower than the wild type enzyme. In the presence of GdmCl, a sharp red shift in fluorescence wavelength due to subunit dissociation can be sensitively detected using a single tryptophan, with the region surrounding W74 undergoing the first transition with a [GdmCl](1/2) of 0.45 M. Further measurement of unfolding curves by CD revealed that the W169A mutant was most unstable with a [GdmCl](1/2) of 0.22 M. From sedimentation velocity analysis, the unstable conformation of the W169A mutant affected the assembly of the quaternary structure. Our studies demonstrate the critical role for the tryptophan residues in stabilizing protein conformations and subunit assembly in delta-crystallin.

In recent years, a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (AIV) H5N1 subtype has emerged as a pathogenic agens for a variety of species including humans. To investigate the pathogenicity of AIV, the isolate ZFE/2004 (H5N1) was used to infect chickens, mice, and pigs. The results showed that the isolate showed attributes of the highly pathogenic AIV such as high pathogenicity index (intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) of 2.85 and intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) of 3.00) and a specified hemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site. In vivo experiments indicated that this isolate was highly lethal to the Balb/c mice. In addition, it was able to infect pigs, elicit specific antibodies, and cause "flu-like" clinical symptoms. Typical pathological changes were observed in the chickens as well. In vitro experiments showed that the isolate ZFE/2004 was able to induce apoptosis of infected MDCK cells that was detected by the DNA fragmentation analysis and electron microscopy.

Mitochondrial DNA plays an important role in living organisms. In this study, the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of the Wugangtong grey goose was reported in Human Province first, which was determined through PCR-based method. The total length of the mitogenome is 16,740 bp. It contains the typical structure, including 2 ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, 13 protein-coding genes and 1 non-coding control region (D-loop region) as that of most other vertebrates. The overall composition of the mitogenome was estimated to be 30.22% for A, 22.67% for T, 32.05% for C and 15.07% for G. All the protein initiation codons are ATG, except for COX1, COX2 and ND5 are GTG, ND6 is CTA. The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of the Wugangtong grey goose will provides an important data set for the study in genetic mechanism of goose in Hunan province.

Neuregulin 1 (Nrg1) is one of the most active members of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like family, which bind to the ErbB tyrosine kinase receptor and play many roles in modulation of synaptic activity, synaptogenesis, GABAergic neurotransmission, neurotransmitter receptor expression and the hormonal control of neuroendocrine reproductive development. In this study, we cloned and characterized the cDNA of goose Nrg1 originating from hypothalamus tissues of Huoyan goose using RACE method, investigated the mRNA expression profiles during different stages of the egg-laying cycle by real-time PCR. Multiple alignments and phylogenetic analyses of the deduced amino acid sequence were conducted using bioinformatics tools. We also determined the profiles of blood serum progesterone, estradiol, FSH and LH content during different egg-laying stages using radioimmunoassay. The cDNA of Nrg1 is consisted of 2061bp open reading frame encoding 686 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of goose Nrg1 contains one EGF domain from amino acid residues 224 to 265 and shows a closer genetic relationship to the avian species than to other mammal species. The expression level of Nrg1 mRNA increased from the pre-laying period to the peak-laying period, reached its peak in the peak-laying period, and then decreased in the ceased period. The concentrations of FSH and estradiol in blood serum have the similar changing trend. These results might suggest a potential correlation between Nrg1/ErbB signaling network with the reproductive neuroendocrine of Huoyan goose.

Sediment ingestion has recently been identified as an important exposure route for toxicants in waterfowl. The effects of lead-contaminated sediment from the Coeur d'Alene River Basin (CDARB) in Idaho on posthatching development of Canada geese (Branta canadensis) were examined for 6 wk. Day-old goslings received either untreated control diet, clean sediment (48%) supplemented control diet, or CDARB sediment (3449 microg/g lead) supplemented diets at 12%, 24%, or 48%. The 12% CDARB diet resulted in a geometric mean blood lead concentration of 0.68 ppm (ww), with over 90% depression of red blood cell ALAD activity and over fourfold elevation of free erythrocyte protoporphyrin concentration. The 24% CDARB diet resulted in blood lead of 1.61 ppm with decreased hematocrit, hemoglobin, and plasma protein in addition to the effects just described. The 48% CDARB diet resulted in blood lead of 2.52 ppm with 22% mortality, decreased growth, and elevated plasma lactate dehydrogenase-L (LDH-L) activity. In this group the liver lead concentration was 6.57 ppm (ww), with twofold increases in hepatic lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, TBARS) and in reduced glutathione concentration; associated effects included elevated glutathione reductase activity but lower protein-bound thiols concentration and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH) activity. The kidney lead concentration in this group was 14.93 ppm with subacute renal tubular nephrosis in one of the surviving goslings. Three other geese in this treatment group exhibited calcified areas of marrow, and one of these displayed severe chronic fibrosing pancreatitis. Lead from CDARB sediment accumulated less readily in gosling blood and tissues than reported in ducklings but at given concentrations was generally more toxic to goslings. Many of these effects were similar to those reported in wild geese and mallards within the Coeur d'Alene River Basin.

Recent functional studies have demonstrated that the microRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in ovarian gonadal development, steroidogenesis, apoptosis, and ovulation in mammals. However, little is known about the involvement of miRNAs in the ovarian function of fowl. The goose (Anas cygnoides) is a commercially important food that is cultivated widely in China but the goose industry has been hampered by high broodiness and poor egg laying performance, which are influenced by ovarian function.

The successful hybridization of remote representatives of Anatidae family lies within intra- and interspecific combinations. The hybrid progeny obtained in such crosses is fertile and can be used in the future breeding work. The more remote crosses are accompanied by various indices of fecundation of eggs, growth of hybrid embryos, hatching of little ones and fertility of hybrid progeny. The stage of their occurrences is determined by propinquity of initial species.

Lysozymes are antibacterial effectors of the innate immune system in animals that hydrolyze peptidoglycan. Bacteria have evolved protective mechanisms that contribute to lysozyme tolerance such as the production of lysozyme inhibitors, but only inhibitors of chicken (c-) and invertebrate (i-) type lysozyme have been identified. We here report the discovery of a novel Escherichia coli inhibitor specific for goose (g-) type lysozymes, which we designate PliG (periplasmic lysozyme inhibitor of g-type lysozyme). Although it does not inhibit c- or i-type lysozymes, PliG shares a structural sequence motif with the previously described PliI and MliC/PliC lysozyme inhibitor families, suggesting a common ancestry and mode of action. Deletion of pliG increased the sensitivity of E. coli to g-type lysozyme. The existence of inhibitors against all major types of animal lysozyme and their contribution to lysozyme tolerance suggest that lysozyme inhibitors may play a role in bacterial interactions with animal hosts.

Egg white proteins play an important role in avian reproductive systems and are an ideal resource for bioreactor construction. In this study, 1D electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF-MS were performed to analyze egg white proteins in four species. In total, 18, 11, 28, and 13 proteins were identified in the egg whites of the chicken, duck, goose, and pigeon, respectively. Egg white proteins in chickens have been studied previously; therefore, we focused on the proteins in goose and duck egg whites. Based on the amino acid sequence analysis and a comparison of the unique peptides, high similarity was observed between the goose and duck egg whites. Diversity in the regulatory region of the ovalbumin gene explained the higher ovalbumin expression in the duck and goose than in the chicken. These data clarify the evolutionary processes underlying to the unique peptides contributing to the differential expression of ovalbumin in avians.

Numbers of large grazing bird (geese, swans, cranes) have increased all over Europe, but monitoring these species, e.g. for management purposes, can be time consuming and costly. In Bavaria, sedentary Greylag geese (Anser anser) are monitored during the winter by two different citizen-based monitoring schemes: the International Waterbird Census [IWC] and hunting bag statistics. We compared the results of both schemes for the seasons 1988/89 to 2010/11 by analysing annual indices calculated using the software TRends and Indices for Monitoring Data-TRIM.

Lack 18:125-128 (1967) proposed that clutch size in precocial species was regulated by nutrients available to females during breeding. Drent and Daan 68:225-252 (1980) proposed the individual optimization hypothesis, whereby individual state determines the optimal combination of breeding date and clutch size. Neither hypothesis accounts for variation in nutrients among females at the end of egg laying, strong right truncations in clutch size distributions, or the fact that many species with precocial young are determinate layers. One solution is that there is a maximum clutch size, above which the number of fledged young declines. We manipulated brood size in Black Brent geese to decouple brood size from maternal quality and produce broods larger than the natural maximum. We recaptured marked goslings to assess variation in prefledging survival as a function of brood size and we estimated relative prefledging survival of goslings using a Bayesian hierarchical approach. We considered effects of natural clutch size, brood size and their interaction on probability that we captured goslings at about 4 weeks of age. Prefledging survival declined with increasing brood size ([Formula: see text] = -0.53; 95% CI -0.91 to -0.16), while laid clutch size had little influence on prefledging survival ([Formula: see text] = -0.04; 95% CI -0.42 to 0.32). Despite declining per capita survival with increasing brood size, the most productive brood size was six goslings, which is greater than the typical maximum clutch size of five. Thus, reduced survival in large broods, by itself, is not the sole mechanism that limits maximum clutch size. We suggest elsewhere that incubation limitation and lower residual reproductive value for females tending larger broods may be other mechanisms limiting maximal clutch size in brent.

The role of wild avian species in the natural history of influenza is unknown. A serological study was carried out to ascertain the prevalence, distribution, and types of influenza antibody in several wild Canada goose populations. Geese were trapped and blood samples were obtained in each of 4 consecutive years, 1966-69. Antibody to influenzavirus was found in 66 (4.7%) of the 1 401 Canada geese tested by the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. Antiribonucleoprotein antibody was found in 8 of 1 359 sera tested by the agar gel precipitation (AGP) test. An increase in the percentage of reactors was seen each year. This increase was greater in two refuges with nonmigratory flocks. HI antibody was found against the turkey/Wisconsin/66, turkey/Wisconsin/68, turkey/Canada/63, and turkey/Alberta/6962/66, or closely related viruses. No antibody was found against duck/Ukraine/1/63 or human A/Hong Kong/68 virus at a time when the latter was prevalent in human populations, suggesting that Canada geese played no direct role in spreading the virus.Canada geese were experimentally exposed to turkey/Wisconsin/66 and turkey/Wisconsin/68 viruses; mallard ducks were exposed to turkey/Wisconsin/66 virus. HI antibody developed in 75% of the geese and 40% of the ducks but was generally short-lived. Anti-RNP antibody was detected in 15% of the exposed geese but in none of the ducks. Virus was recovered from 3 of 10 adult ducks but not from geese. None of the birds showed signs of disease.

Four experiments were conducted to examine the riboflavin, pantothenic acid, nicotinic acid, and choline requirements of young Embden geese fed purified diets. Goslings fed diets deficient in either riboflavin, pantothenic acid, nicotinic acid, or choline grew poorly. Feeding a pantothenic acid-deficient diet resulted in 100% mortality. Goslings fed diets containing 530 mg/kg of choline or less developed perosis. Under the conditions of these experiments it was found that: 1) goslings require no more than 3.84 mg/kg of riboflavin and 31.2 mg/kg of nicotinic acid in the diet for rapid growth and normal development, 2) the pantothenic acid requirement of goslings is no more than 12.6 mg/kg of diet, and 3) a dietary choline level of 1530 mg/kg is adequate for both the prevention of perosis and rapid growth of goslings. The levels of vitamins found to support normal growth and development of goslings appear to be similar to requirements of other species that have been examined.

The full-length genome of goose hemorrhagic polyomavirus (GHPV), the ethiologic agent of hemorrhagic nephritis and enteritis of geese, was cloned and sequenced. Transfection of the circular ds DNA with a size of 5256 bp and an organisation typical of polyomaviruses produced viral progeny in cultured goose cells. According to the splicing sites determined by RT-PCR, five open reading frames (ORFs) were found to encode putative proteins with significant similarities to large T antigen and small t antigen as well as VP1, VP2, and VP3 of other polyomaviruses. An additional ORF located in the 5' region of late mRNA, with a coding capacity for 169 amino acids, shows a low degree of homology to VP4 of avian polyomavirus (APV). The alignment of nucleotide sequences and amino acid sequences revealed a relatively close relationship between GHPV and APV. Therefore, grouping of this new polyomavirus into the proposed subgenus Avipolyomavirus is suggested.

The H5N1 virus (H5N1/97) that caused the bird flu incident in Hong Kong in 1997 has not been isolated since the poultry slaughter in late 1997. But the donor of its H5 hemagglutinin gene, Goose/Guangdong/1/96-like (Gs/Gd/96-like) virus, established a distinct lineage and continued to circulate in geese in the area. In 2000, a virus from the Goose/Guangdong/1/96 lineage was isolated for the first time from domestic ducks. Subsequently, it has undergone reassortment, and these novel reassortants now appear to have replaced Gs/Gd/96-like viruses from its reservoir in geese and from ducks. The internal gene constellation is also different from H5N1/97, but these variants have the potential for further reassortment events that may allow the interspecies transmission of the virus.

Feces, urates or dirt originating from feathers often contaminate gander semen during collection, threatening its fertilizing ability. Seminal plasma used as a diluent has a similar effect, particularly on spermatozoa subjected to cryopreservation or short-term storage under refrigeration. The aim of the experiments was to evaluate the effects on spermatozoa motility, morphology and fertilizing ability after minimizing the influence of the contaminants by semen filtration or dilution prior to freezing. Pooled semen, collected twice a week from 9 White Italian ganders by dorso-abdominal massage, was divided into two parts. One sample was filtered and both were diluted in 1:1 or 1:0.5 (v/v) with EK diluent, equilibrated for 15 min at +4 degrees C, mixed with dimethyl-acetamide (DMA) in the final concentration 6% (v/v) and frozen to -140 degrees C in a computerized freezer, at a rate of 60 degrees C/min. In fresh and processed (filtered, freeze-thawed) semen were examined the spermatozoa motility and morphology, and fertilizing ability for freeze-thawed semen, both for unfiltered and filtered. In freeze-thawed semen no tangible differences due to experimental factors were observed in motility and percent of live spermatozoa in total. On average 35 to 42% of the spermatozoa survived the freezing process, but only 10 to 15% were normal, without any damage visible under the light microscope. The fertility of unfiltered freeze-thawed semen inseminated twice a week in a 0.2 mL dose (about 3 to 5 x 10(6) of live normal spermatozoa each) averaged 66.1% and hatchability of the set eggs 57.1 and 86.5% of the fertile eggs. The fertility obtained after the insemination with semen filtered prior to freezing was lower (64.3%), but hatchability was slightly higher (58.6 and 91.1% of set and fertile eggs, respectively). The duration of fertility for filtered semen was longer than that for unfiltered, 10 days after the last insemination the eggs were still fertile. The fertility results of freeze-thawed gander semen were very promising taking into consideration the small amount of inseminated live normal spermatozoa and it is possible to improve this result by increasing the number of spermatozoa in the insemination dose.

We have previously demonstrated that a sharp rise in feed intake (hyperphagia) and spontaneous liver steatosis could be experimentally induced in domestic Greylag geese by combining a short photoperiod and a sequence of feed restriction followed by ad libitum corn feeding during the fall and the winter. In this previous work, however, individual feed intake could not be recorded. The present study aimed at evaluating the relationship between level and pattern of hyperphagia and liver weight with an individual control of feed intake in individually housed (IH) geese, while comparing the performances with group housed (GH) geese. A total of 300 male geese of 19 weeks of age, were provided with corn ad libitum after an initial feed restriction period. From 21 to 23 weeks of age, the daylight duration was progressively reduced from 10 to 7 h and kept as such until the end of the experiment (week 36). In all, 30 GH and 30 IH geese were slaughtered at 19, 27, 30, 32 and 36 weeks of age. Feed intake was measured per group in GH geese and individually in IH geese. During the 1st week of corn feeding, the average feed intake rose up to 600 g/goose per day in GH geese but not in IH geese where the feed intake rose gradually from 300 to 400 g/day. The liver weight increased from 93 g (week 19) to 497 g (week 32; P<0.05) in GH birds. In IH birds, liver weights were, on average, much lower (ranging from 220 to 268 g) than in GH birds (P<0.05). In GH and IH bird, the variability in the individual response to corn feeding was very high (liver weight cv ranging from 63% to 83% depending on slaughter age). A close correlation between corn consumption and liver weight was evidenced in IH birds at each slaughter age (R 2 ranging from 0.62 to 0.79), except at 36 weeks of age where this correlation was weak (R 2=0.14). The variability in the extent of liver steatosis is very high and our results in IH birds clearly point out the major role of hyperphagia, mainly at the beginning of the ad libitum corn feeding period, on the development of spontaneous liver steatosis.

Three passages of goose hepatitis virus of muscoy duck embryo cell cultures were used as a vaccine in geese. The offspring of birds inoculated with the thirty-second of fifty-fifth passage were found to be immune to experimental infection with virulent goose hepatitis virus. The fifty-fifth passage, inoculated intramuscularly, did not result in transmission of the virus, neither through the hatching egg nor by direct contact. The eight-seventh passage was non-pathogenic for susceptible day-old goslings and produced active and adequate immunity in these young birds.

Muscovy duck parvovirus (MDPV) is the etiological agent of Muscovy duckling parvoviral disease, which is characterized by diarrhea, locomotive dysfunction, stunting, and death in young ducklings, and causes substantial economic losses in the Muscovy duck industry worldwide. FZ91-30 is an attenuated vaccine strain that is safe and immunogenic to ducklings, but the genomic information and molecular mechanism underlining the attenuation are not understood.

1. Uropygial glands of domestic goose and mallard which synthesize methyl-branched fatty acids, contain large quantities of cytosolic malonyl-CoA decarboxylase and a small quantity of mitochondrial enzyme. 2. Uropygial glands of chicken and the liver of geese which generate little methyl-branched acids, contain only small quantities of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase and in such cases the enzyme is in the mitochondria. 3. The mitochondrial decarboxylase from the uropygial gland and liver of goose is immunologically similar to the cytosolic decarboxylase of the uropygial gland. 4. The mitochondrial enzyme probably protects the mitochondrial enzymes which are susceptible to inhibition by malonyl-CoA, whereas the cytosolic enzyme promotes the synthesis of methyl-branched acids.

The initiation and control of spinal locomotor mechanisms by supraspinal brainstem centers has been studied in many vertebrate species. However there is very little information regarding brainstem-spinal pathways involved in avian locomotion. To undertake these studies, birds (geese or ducks) were placed in a stereotaxic frame and decerebrated under halothane anesthesia. After anesthesia was discontinued, discrete brainstem regions were electrically stimulated. Locomotion could be evoked from several areas within the pontomedullary reticular formation. The stimulus threshold for evoking walking ranged from 25-50 microA at 30-80 Hz (pulse duration 0.5 ms). At slightly higher current strengths (50-100 microA) wing flapping ('flying') was initiated. Histological examination of the stimulation sites indicated that the predominant locomotor areas were restricted to the ventromedial gigantocellular reticular formation and a more dorsolateral location within the parvocellular reticular formation. To ascertain whether neurons in these regions of the avian brainstem project directly to the spinal cord, a retrograde fluorescent tracer dye, True blue, was injected into either the cervical or low thoracic spinal cord. Comparing the positions of the retrogradely labeled neurons and the effective locomotor stimulation sites indicated a high degree of overlap. The present results, when compared with previous studies, suggest strong similarities in descending brainstem control of locomotion for all vertebrates.

The processes of digestion in the avian gastrointestinal tract depend on sophisticated control systems that co-ordinate secretion of digestive juices and movement of the luminal contents. In the current study, the distribution of serotonin-, gastrin-, glucagon- and somatostatin-immunoreactive endocrine cells was investigated by immunocytochemical methods in the intestinal tract of the goose. The number of cells immunoreactive for each antiserum was evaluated in different regions of the intestinal tract. Serotonin-, glucagon- and somatostatin-immunoreactive endocrine cells were seen throughout the intestinal tract, but somatostatin-immunoreactive cells were not detected in the colon of the goose. Gastrin-immunoreactive cells were detected only in the duodenum, jejunum and colon mucosa. It is concluded that the distribution pattern of the entero-endocrine cells in the goose is similar to that of most of the mammalian and other poultry species.

By using primers (AL18F2 and AL18R2) designed from goose parvovirus (GPV) strain IHC, an 806-bp band was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from all of 17 samples from Thailand. Specificity to GPV was confirmed by Southern hybridization. With restriction enzyme digestion of the PCR products, two isolates differed from the other 15 isolates by the absence of restriction sites for HincII and BglII and the presence of EcoR1 site. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the PCR products from the different groups revealed that one group is GPV and the other group is Muscovy duck parvovirus (MDPV). Thus restriction enzyme fragment length polymorphism analysis of the PCR products could be used to distinguish GPV and MDPV. The data showed that GPV and MDPV are present in Thailand.

We give estimates of variances and covariances of survival rates for subgroups of a wild population surveyed by mark-recapture methods. These are used in forming test statistics to compare subgroup survival rates. We show that using correct standard errors based on the appropriate approximate sampling model and incorporating important covariances of observed frequencies avoids spurious significance of survival rate differences.

Geese are an economically important poultry species worldwide. Their superior meat production performance and meat qual-ity make them a popular food. However, they are not bred worldwide because their poor laying capacity increases farming costs. To gain a global view of the genes that are differentially expressed between pre-laying (P) and laying (L) periods and to develop a database for further studies, we performed large-scale transcriptome sequencing of ovarian tissue collected from Anser cygnoides. In total, 30,151,422 raw reads, with an average length of 151 bp and a total length of 4,552,864,722 bp, were obtained. After primers and adaptors were removed, 19,167,132 clean reads, with an average length of 134.5 bp and a total length of 2,577,297,281 bp, were obtained, among which 1,268,906,694 bp and 1,308,390,587 bp were from L and P ovarian tissue, respectively. The 16,605 assembled sequences were further functionally annotated by comparing their sequences to different protein and functional domain databases and assigning gene ontology (GO) terms. Of these, 511 as-sembled sequences were considered differentially expressed based on the 2-fold method, among which 396 were assigned at least one GO term. Digital expression analysis using the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes annotation identified 121 genes that were differ-entially expressed in the P vs L periods. Five of these are of special interest for further investigation of their roles in determining high re-productive performance. This study provides valuable information and sequence resources for uncovering genes determining high egg-laying performance and for future functional genomics analysis of geese.

Breast muscle samples, with or without overlying adipose tissue and skin, were obtained from Canada geese collected in northeastern illinois while undergoing feather molt. Specimens were evaluated for contaminant concentrations to determine if they would be acceptable as human food provided through government-subsidized programs. Samples were baked, allowing fat to drip free, and assayed for persistent organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls. Residues of heptachlor epoxide, dieldrin, DDE and PCBs (as Arochlor 1248) were detected. The specimens contained relatively low concentrations of contaminants, such that US Department of Agriculture residue limits for meat were exceeded in only 1 sample. Baking of breast muscle without the overlying skin and adipose tissue resulted in reductions in concentrations of detectable compounds. Fewer samples baked with the skin attached had detectable concentrations of heptachlor epoxide, dieldrin and PCB then samples cooked without skin; however, the converse was true for DDE. Periodic monitoring for environmental contaminants such as PCBs, exclusion of geese from localities where samples have contaminants such as PCBs, exclusion of geese from localities where samples have contaminants at concentrations that exceed recommended dietary limits, the use of processing and/or cooking methods which remove large amounts of lipid, and advisories that provide information on known health risks are recommended if wild resident Canada geese from the Chicago area are provided as food for underprivileged humans.

Newcastle disease virus (NDV) has been thought to infect only domestic avian species, with waterfowl such as geese either not being infected, even by virulent strains, or developing only in apparent infection. In 1997, a new infectious disease producing high morbidity and mortality among geese broke out in many provinces of China, which was caused by a serotype I avian paramyxovirus (APMV-1)--NDV. To investigate how NDV spreads between chickens and geese, the complete genome of one NDV strain isolated from a goose was cloned and analyzed. The results indicate that there is conservation in NDV structural genetic evolution but that there are also considerable differences between goose and chicken NDV strains. Separate patterns of NDV evolution exist among wild bird species. Meanwhile, there is evidence indicating that the goose NDV may have evolved from chicken NDV strain Herts/33. In addition, the possibility was investigated that this new strain of NDV may bind to different sialic acid receptor binding sites than the normal NDV strains that have been investigated so far. This might provide clues to the evolution of the goose NDV.

The objective of this trial was to study the influence of dietary fiber sources on the gastrointestinal fermentation, digestive enzyme activity, and mucosa morphology of growing Greylag geese. In total, 240 Greylag geese (28-day-old) were allocated to 4 treatments (15 pens/treatment) differing in dietary fiber source: corn straw silage (CSS group), steam-exploded corn straw (SECS group), steam-exploded wheat straw (SEWS group), or steam-exploded rice straw (SERS group). At 112 days of age, 15 birds per group were euthanized to collect samples. No difference (P > 0.05) was found on all the gastrointestinal pH values and ammonia-nitrogen concentrations between the groups. The CSS and SERS groups had a lower (P < 0.05) proportion of acetic acid in the gizzard than the SECS and SEWS groups. The CSS group had a higher VFA concentration in the jejunum (P < 0.05) and acetic acid proportion (P < 0.01) in the ceca, and a lower (P < 0.01) butyric acid proportion than the other groups except for the SECS group. The SECS group had a higher (P < 0.01) acetic acid proportion and lower (P < 0.05) proportions of propionic acid and valeric acid in the ceca than the SEWS and SERS groups. Different fiber sources resulted in different VFA profiles, especially in the gizzard and ceca. Almost all gastrointestinal protease activities of the CSS group were higher (P < 0.05) than the other groups, along with lower (P < 0.01) amylase activities in the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and ceca. Lipase activity in proventriculus was highest (P < 0.01) in the SEWS group and its cecal activity was lower (P < 0.01) in the SECS and SEWS groups than the CSS and SERS groups with a higher (P < 0.01) lipase activity in the CSS group than the SERS group. The SECS and SERS groups had a higher cellulase activity in the ceca than the CSS and SEWS groups, with a higher (P < 0.01) rectal cellulase activity in the SERS group than the other groups. There was no significant effect (P > 0.05) on the intestinal mucosa morphology. These results suggest that corn straw silage improves protein digestion while steam-exploded straw provides more energy.

In response to overfeeding, the Landes goose develops a fatty liver that is twice as large as that of the Poland goose, despite similar food intake. The role of hepatic lipogenesis in the genetic susceptibility to fatty liver was assessed in male overfed geese of the two breeds. For a similar hepatic protein content, total activities of malic enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, acetyl-Coa-carboxylase and fatty acid synthase, and specific activity and mRNA level of malic enzyme were about two-fold higher in the Landes goose. In the Poland goose, the weight of the fatty liver was correlated positively with the specific activity of ME and the VLDL concentration, which was not the case in the Landes breed. These results show that: (1) hepatic lipogenesis remains very active until the end of the overfeeding period; (2) the pentose-phosphate pathway may function in birds, contrary to what is assumed usually; (3) the level of hepatic lipogenesis is a major factor in the susceptibility to hepatic steatosis in different breeds of geese; and (4) ME activity may be a limiting factor of lipid synthesis in the less susceptible Poland breed.

TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator (TANK)-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) serves as hub molecule at the crossroad of multiple signaling pathways of type I interferon (IFN) induction. The importance of TBK1 in innate immunity has been demonstrated in mammalian, however the characterization and function of TBK1 in avian remains largely unknown. In this study, we cloned duck TBK1 (duTBK1) from duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs) for the first time, which encoded 729 amino acids and had a high amino acid identity with goose and cormorant TBK1s. The duTBK1 showed a diffuse cytoplasmic localization in DEFs and was extensively expressed in all tested tissues. Overexpression of duTBK1 induced IFN-β production through the activation of IRF1 and NF-κB in DEFs. The N-terminal kinase domain and the ubiquitin-like domain in middle of duTBK1 played pivotal roles in IFN-β induction as well as in IRF1 and NF-κB activation. Furthermore, knockdown of duTBK1 by small interfering RNA significantly decreased poly(I:C)- or Sendai virus (SeV)-induced IFN-β expression. In addition, duTBK1 expression dramatically reduced the replication of both duck reovirus (DRV) and duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV) in DEFs. These results suggested that the duTBK1 played a pivotal role in mediating duck antiviral innate immunity.

The preparation and properties of ceruloplasmin from goose blood plasma are described. Ammonium sulfate was used to precipitate the crude protein followed by adsorption and elution from DEAE-Sephadex A-50. Further treatment with an ethanol-chloroform mixture and Sephadex G-200 yielded an intensely blue protein possessing a high degree of chemical purity and biological activity. Goose ceruloplasmin, existing in two forms, appears to be a single polypeptide, apparent Mr121,300, with an A610/A280 ratio of 0.07. Copper represented 0.32%, which corresponded to six atoms of copper per protein molecule. Although the amount of EPR-detectable copper was the same as in mammalian ceruloplasmins there were some differences in EPR parameters, mainly in A parallel. Goose ceruloplasmin's amino acid composition, although similar in many residues to human ceruloplasmin, was lower in tyrosine, cystine/cysteine, and acidic amino acids. Valine was found as the N-terminal amino acid. Hexose, hexosamine, sialic acid, and fucose accounted for 6.65% of the weight. Goose protein contained only half the sialic acid of human ceruloplasmin. Two values for Km using either p-phenylenediamine (0.64 and 0.053 mM) or o-dianisidine (0.76 and 0.15 mM) were evaluated from Lineweaver-Burk plots. EPR studies on reactions with water radiolysis products at cryogenic temperatures allowed us to discover that goose ceruloplasmin, like human and bovine ceruloplasmins, possesses superoxide dismutase activity.

1. Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase from the uropygial gland of goose was inactivated by treatment with low concentrations of acetic anhydride in Tris-acetate buffer. 2. The degree of inactivation depended on the concentration of the reagent and time of incubation. 3. Treatment of the enzyme with [1-14C] acetic anhydride resulted in covalent attachment of the label exclusively to the decarboxylase protomer. 4. Evidence is presented that the label incorporated into the protein was exclusively in N-epsilon-acetyllysine. Graphical analysis suggested that acetylation of about two lysine residues/subunit would be required for complete inactivation of the enzyme. 5. Malonyl-CoA, acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA afforded partial protection to the enzyme against inactivation by acetic anhydride. 6. 3'-Dephosphomalonyl-CoA was found to be an alternate substrate for the enzyme with approximately the same Km and V values as for malonyl-CoA. 7. This alternate substrate also partially protected the enzyme from inactivation, whereas adenine nucleotides with 2'-, 3', or 5'-phosphates did not protect the enzyme. 8. These results suggest that a lysine residue acetylated by acetic anhydride is essential for the enzyme activity and that it is probably at or near the active site. The results are consistent with the suggestion that the enzyme is composed of four identical subunits.

In fed geese, plasma levels of glucose and alanine were 1.9 g.l-1 and 560 mumol.l-1, respectively. During a long fast (40 days), plasma glucose and alanine were maintained at a high level (1.5-1.8 g.l-1 and 370-540 mumol.l-1, respectively). Plasma level of acetoacetate was very low (40 mumol.l-1); by contrast, plasma level of beta hydroxybutyrate reached very high values (20 mmol.l-1) after about 20 days of fasting, then it decreased. Plasma levels of lactate and pyruvate decreased along the course of the fast, from 2 500 to 2 000 mumol.l-1 and 220 to 170 mumol.l-1, respectively.

The fractionation and physicochemical characterization of the complex molecular components composing the plasma lipoprotein spectrum in the goose, a potential model of liver steatosis, are described. Twenty lipoprotein subfractions (d less than 1.222 g/ml) were separated by isopycnic density gradient ultracentrifugation, and characterized according to their chemical composition, particle size and particle heterogeneity, electrophoretic mobility, and apolipoprotein content. Analytical ultracentrifugal analyses showed high density lipoproteins (HDL) to predominate (approximately 450 mg/dl plasma), the peak of its distribution occurring at d approximately 1.090 g/ml (F1.21 approximately 2.5). The HDL class displayed marked density heterogeneity, HDL1-like particles being detected up to a lower density limit of approximately 1.020 g/ml, particle size decreasing progressively from 17-19 nm at d 1.024-1.028 g/ml to 10.5-12 nm (d 1.055-1.065 g/ml), and then remaining constant (approximately 9 nm) at densities greater than 1.065 g/ml. HDL subfractions displayed multiple size species; five subspecies were present over the range d 1.103-1.183 g/ml with diameters of 10.5, 9.9, 9.0, 8.2, and 7.5 nm, four in the range d 1.090-1.103 g/ml (diameters 10.5, 9.9, 9.0, and 8.2 nm) and three over the range d 1.076-1.090 g/ml (diameters 10.5, 9.9, and 9.0 nm). ApoA-I (Mr 25,000-27,000) was the major apolipoprotein in all goose HDL subfractions, while the minor components (apparent Mr 100,000, 91,000, 64,000, 58,000, approximately 42,000, 18,000 and apoC-like proteins) showed marked quantitative and qualitative variation across this density range (i.e., 1.055-1.165 g/ml). The d 1.063 g/ml boundary for separation of goose low density lipoproteins (LDL) from HDL was inappropriate, since HDL-like particles were present in the density interval 1.024-1.063 g/ml, while particles enriched in apoB (Mr approximately 540,000) and resembling LDL in size (approximately 20.5 nm) were detected up to a density of approximately 1.076 g/ml. Goose LDL itself was a major component of the profile (90-172 mg/dl) with a single peak of high flotation rate (Sf approximately 10.5). The physicochemical properties and apolipoprotein content of intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL) and LDL varied but little over the range d 1.013-1.040 g/ml, presenting as two particle species (diameters 20.5 and 21 nm) of essentially constant chemical composition; LDL (d 1.019-1.040 g/ml) were separated from HDL1 by gel filtration chromatography and appeared to contain primarily apoB with lesser amounts of apoA-I.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).

The proportion and the distribution over 24 h of the different arousal stages characterized in geese--wakefulness (W), drowsiness (D), and slow-wave (SWS) and paradoxical sleep (PS)--were studied in caged birds when fed and then fasted during about 40 days. In both the fed and fasted state, each arousal stage was distributed through numerous episodes of a short duration. The geese slept a little more during the night than during the day, a difference that was moderately emphasized during the fast. Fasting induced only a slight decrease in W. There were important changes in SWS and D in relation to the periods of fasting that were previously found to correspond to changes in lipid and protein utilization. When proteins were spared and lipids accounted for most of the energy expenditure, the fasted geese went more and more rapidly from W to SWS (proportion of D decreased from 33 to 13%/day) and slept for progressively longer periods (SWS increased from 23 to 49%/day). By contrast, when protein utilization rose, the general trend in sleep was a decrease in SWS and an increase in D. During the fast, changes in PS were in the same proportion as those in SWS. These reactions are examined for their implications in energy-saving and sleep mechanisms.

Identifying the origin of animal species in manufactured meat products is of considerable economic, religious and sanitary importance. In this study, we developed a multiplex PCR method to simultaneously detect chicken, duck and goose DNA in meat products derived from beef, pork, mutton or quail. The PCR primers were designed based on the sequence of mitochondrial genes of each avian species, and the amplicon sizes were 131, 283 and 387bp for chicken, duck and goose, respectively. The method had no cross-reaction with DNA isolated from beef, mutton, pork or quail, and generated products at a target DNA content as low as 0.05ng, or a target meat content of 1% of total meat weight. Moreover, screening of 24 commercial meat samples using this method indicated that six, two and one samples were contaminated with chicken, duck, or both, respectively, suggesting its usefulness for the simultaneous identification of chicken, duck and goose DNA in commercial meat products.

The avian cardiovascular system is interesting because birds have larger hearts and lower heart rates than mammals of the same size. This study defines how cardiovascular function is related to body size in nine species of birds encompassing a 1,000-fold size range. Heart mass (HM, g) was related to body mass (M, kg) by the following equation: HM = 8.76 M0.92, and the heart rate (HR, beats X min-1) to body mass by HR = 178.5 M-0.282. Cardiac output (Q, ml X min-1) was related to body mass as Q = 290.7 M0.69. Birds also had a greater cardiac output for a given body mass than mammals. Cardiac output was directly proportional to the rate of O2 consumption (VO2, ml X min-1): Q = 17.5 VO2(1.04), with birds having a greater cardiac output for a given VO2 than mammals. (Variables are considered directly proportional if the exponent does not differ significantly from one). As in mammals, stroke volume (SV, ml) was also directly proportional to body mass: SV = 1.72 M0.97, but for a given body size stroke volume was larger in birds than in mammals. However, as bird hearts are disproportionately large in comparison with body size, when stroke volume is expressed per gram of heart (SV = 0.177 HM1.05) birds have a significantly lower stroke volume-to-heart weight ratio than mammals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).

Since early 2016, the Chinese goose industry has experienced severe outbreaks of gout; however, the etiological factor of the disease is still unclear. Here, we investigated the possible involvement of viral infection in the disease. Using sequence-independent PCR amplification, astrovirus sequences were generated from a gout case. Full-length genomic sequencing and sequence analysis of three goose astrovirus (GoAstV) strains revealed that they belong to a new avastrovirus most closely related to viruses classified within species Avastrovirus 3. The GoAstV was detected in 16/16 gout cases collected from two provinces, supporting a pathogenic role for the new avastrovirus.

The susceptibility of geese of different genotypes and sexes to force-feeding, some plasma biochemical parameters (thyroid hormones, cholesterol, retinoids, total protein and albumin) of force-fed geese, and the relationship between force-feeding, fat storage and the above-mentioned parameters were studied. Sixty (30 male and 30 female) geese of three genotypes (Hungarian, Landes and their crossbred called Babat Hybrid) were divided in two groups at 12 weeks of age. Geese in one group (5 males and 5 females from each genotype) received mixed feeding ad libitum. Birds in the other group were force-fed with maize. After 3 weeks all birds were bled, blood samples were taken, and the above-mentioned plasma parameters were determined. Thyroxine (T4) levels were significantly lower in force-fed (11.6 +/- 3.5 ng/ml) than in control geese (22.7 +/- 4.09 ng/ml). Plasma triiodothyronine (T3) level was also lower in the force-fed than in the control group, but the difference was not significant (1.87 +/- 0.23 ng/ml and 2.11 +/- 0.28 ng/ml, respectively). Plasma total protein (TP, 45.2 +/- 4.5 g/l), albumin (ALB, 16.51 +/- 2.8 g/l), beta-carotene (BC, 3504 +/- 3107 micrograms/l), retinol (ROL, 1160 +/- 505 micrograms/l), retinyl palmitate (RP, 1745 +/- 405 micrograms/l) and total cholesterol (TCh, 4.32 +/- 0.55 mmol/l) levels were elevated in the force-fed group as compared to the control (TP = 36.4 +/- 5.1 g/l, ALB = 15.6 +/- 0.9 g/l, BC = 1657 +/- 1681 micrograms/l, ROL = 687 +/- 375 micrograms/l, RP = 1398 +/- 607 micrograms/l, and TCh = 2.83 +/- 1.98 mmol/l). All differences were significant except those found for albumin and beta-carotene. No significant sex- or genotype-related effects were observed for these parameters.

Phosphoserine peptides have been isolated by a diagonal electrophoresis method from proteolytic digests of ovalbumins from hen, grouse, turkey, golden pheasant, magpie goose, chinese goose, Aylesbury duck and fulvous whistling duck. The amino acid sequences of these peptides have been determined. There are two sites of phosphorylation in each ovalbumin, which are located in two different regions of the ovalbumin molecule. Amino acid replacements are more frequent in the site 1 sequences than in the site 2 sequences. Both site 1 and site 2 sequences contain invariant residues. Sequence variations occur near the serine residues that are phosphorylated, but the amino acid two residues C-terminal to the phosphoserine is always glutamic acid, suggesting that this may be a recognition signal for the phosphorylating enzyme. Variations in amino acid sequence among the species are consistent with differences in the ovalbumins determined by peptide mapping and quantitative immunoprecipitation assays. A phylogenetic tree has been constructed from a comparison of the sequences of 248 residues from the eight ovalbumins.

Healthy waterfowl were found to be carriers of duck plague (DP) virus. Black ducks (Anas rubripes) and Canada geese (Branta canadensis) surviving a natural outbreak of DP at Coloma, Wisconsin, in 1973 yielded DP virus in cloacal swabs taken four years postinfection. Experimental infection of previously unexposed mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynochos) with the Coloma strain of DP virus CO-WI (73) also produced cloacal virus shedding for up to four years after infection. A second DP virus strain, LA-SD (73) from the Lake Andes, South Dakota, epornitic, was detected from cloacal swabs of pintail ducks (Anas acuta), gadwall ducks (Anas strepera), wood ducks (Aix sponsa), and Canada geese infected experimentally one year before. The frequency of swabs positive for DP virus varied between individuals within each of the tested species. The amount of detectable DP virus shed was about 100 plaqueforming units of virus percloacal swab. Oral erosions were present in all species tested except Canada geese and gadwall ducks. Erosions occurred at the openings of the sublingual salivary gland ducts. DP virus was isolated from erosions. All ducks with lesions proved to shed DP virus, although not necessarily at the time they had the lesion.

The present work describes two cases of consecutive fowl cholera outbreak series occurring in goose and turkey flocks. Most strains isolated from epidemiologically related outbreaks showed genetic relatedness, as revealed by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-PCR and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, suggesting that the consecutive outbreaks were due to recurrences rather than reinfections.

2 mycoplasma strains were isolated, one from the phallic lymph of a gander and the other from a cloacal swab of a laying goose. The strains proved to be different from mycoplasma species isolated from geese before. Strain No. 1223 is a glucose-negative and arginine-negative species belonging to the genus Mycoplasma. In the growth inhibition test, it fails to react with hyperimmune sera raised in rabbits against the presently known mycoplasma species of avian origin nor with sera produced against mammalian mycoplasma species sharing its biochemical properties. Strain No. 1225 belongs to the digitonin resistant Acholeplasmataceae family. It is glucose-positive and aesculin-positive. It is negative by all the other tests and fails to react with sera produced against the presently known acholeplasma species.

delta-Crystallin is a soluble structural protein in found in avian eye lenses; it shares high amino acid sequence identity with argininosuccinate lyase. E294 is the only residue located at the double dimer interface and it performs hydrogen bonding with the active site residues of H160 and K323 in the neighboring and diagonal subunits, respectively. H160 is reported to play an important role in catalysis due to its H-bond interaction with the fumarate moiety of the substrate. In order to clarify the function of E294 in either stabilization of the quaternary structure or in catalysis, we carried out site-directed mutagenesis and functional analysis.

Tracking seasonally changing resources is regarded as a widespread proximate mechanism underpinning animal migration. Migrating herbivores, for example, are hypothesized to track seasonal foliage dynamics over large spatial scales. Previous investigations of this green wave hypothesis involved few species and limited geographical extent, and used conventional correlation that cannot disentangle alternative correlated effects. Here, we introduce stochastic simulations to test this hypothesis using 222 individual spring migration episodes of 14 populations of ten species of geese, swans and dabbling ducks throughout Europe, East Asia, and North America. We find that the green wave cannot be considered a ubiquitous driver of herbivorous waterfowl spring migration, as it explains observed migration patterns of only a few grazing populations in specific regions. We suggest that ecological barriers and particularly human disturbance likely constrain the capacity of herbivorous waterfowl to track the green wave in some regions, highlighting key challenges in conserving migratory birds.

The objective of the current study was to investigate the influence of including whole corn (WC) in goose diets on the performance, digestive tract development, and nutrient retention. A total of 112 Yangzhou geese, 7 d old and with similar BW, were distributed into 8 pens of 14 birds/pen (7 male, 7 female). Each treatment was represented by 4 replicates. Geese were fed corn-soybean-based diets containing 640 g (8-28 d) and 615 g (29-70 d) of corn/kg of diet from 8 to 70 d of age, and 2 particle sizes of corn grains were used: ground corn (GC) and WC. During the period from 8 to 49 d, daily feed intake (P < 0.05) and daily weight gain (P = 0.054) of WC-fed birds tended to be lower than that of GC-fed birds. However, WC diet tended to improve (P = 0.07) G:F from 50 to 70 d of age. Higher relative weights of the gizzard (P < 0.05) at 28, 49, and 70 d, proventriculus at 49 d, and duodenum at 28 and 70 d of age were observed in birds fed the WC diet compared with those fed the GC diet. Intestinal wall thickness in the jejunum and crypt depth and intestinal wall thickness in the ileum were greater (P < 0.05) in WC-fed birds at 28 d of age. Villus height and intestinal wall thickness in the duodenum and villus height in the jejunum were greater in birds fed the WC diet compared with those fed the GC diet at 70 d of age, and birds fed the WC diet had a greater (P < 0.05) intestinal wall thickness, villus height, and crypt depth measurements in the ileum compared with those fed the GC diet. The retention ratio of CP and neutral detergent fiber were higher (P < 0.05) in birds fed the WC diet than in those fed the GC diet. Overall, no negative effect was observed in birds fed the WC diet compared with those maintained on the GC diet.

Hydropericardium hepatitis syndrome (HHS) is a fatal disease in chickens, mainly caused by fowl adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV-4). Since June 2015, HHS has appeared in many provinces in China. The disease has spread from broilers to laying hens, breeders and Cherry Valley ducks, seriously endangering the health of the poultry industry in China. In July 2016, an infectious disease was noticed in a goose farm in Jinan, Shandong Province, China, and hydropericardium was the main finding in post mortem investigations. In the actual study, we isolated a FAdV-4 strain from the livers of naturally-infected goslings and designated it as SDJN. We first evaluated its pathogenicity by inoculating Taizhou geese at 10, 20, and 30 days of age with 10-7.15EID50/0.2 ml doses of the SDJN strain in 1 ml allantoic fluid via subcutaneous injection or oral infection. Clinical signs and pericardial effusion appeared in geese infected subcutaneously at 10 days of age, whereas 20- and 30-day-old geese were not susceptible to FAdV-4. The results of real-time PCR showed that the replication ability of FAdV-4 in geese correlated with the age. Furthermore, results from clinical chemistry showed that FAdV-4 damaged the liver and kidney in geese and the results paralleled viral load and gross lesions. Consequently, FAdV-4 was pathogenic in geese, and the pathogenicity was related to age and mode of infection. This study is the first experimental infection of FAdV-4 in geese, which will provide a basis for further understanding of the disease. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS Pathogenicity tests with a FAdV-4 were conducted in geese, which included data on clinical signs, gross pathology, histopathology, clinical chemistry and viral load. FAdV-4 could replicate in geese and HHS was successfully induced. Pathogenicity of FAdV-4 in geese was related to the age and routes of infection.

Reduced populations of emperor geese (Chen canagica), a Bering Sea endemic, provided the need to assess plasma biochemistry values as indicators of population health. A precursory step to such an investigation was to evaluate patterns of variability in plasma biochemistry values among age, sex, and reproductive period. Plasma from 63 emperor geese was collected on their breeding grounds on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta in western Alaska, USA. The geese sampled included 18 incubating adult females captured, in mid June, on their nests by using bow nets, and 30 adults and 15 goslings captured in corral traps in late July and early August, when the adults were molting their wing feathers and the goslings were 5-6 weeks old. Plasma was evaluated for 15 biochemical parameters, by comparing results among age, sex, and sampling period (incubation versus wing-feather molt). Ten of the 15 biochemical parameters assayed differed among adults during incubation, the adults during molt, and the goslings at molt, whereas sex differences were noted in few parameters.

The aim of this study was to develop a prediction model on tenderization of goose breast meat by response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN). The experiments were operated on the basis of a three-level, three-variable (ultrasound power, ultrasound time, and storage time) Box-Behnken experimental design. Under RSM and ANN optimum conditions, experimental Meullenet-Owens razor shear (MORS) of meat (1862.6 g and 1869.9 g) was in reasonable agreement with predicted one. Nevertheless, better prediction capability of ANN was proved by higher R2 (0.996) and lower absolute average deviation = 4.257) compared to those for RSM (0.852 and 16.534), respectively. These results revealed that ANN was more accurate and much better than RSM model for the optimization of tenderness of meat. The optimum conditions of ultrasound power, ultrasound time, and storage time given by ANN were 812 W, 24.5 min and 25.7 hr, respectively. Under the optimized condition, the cooking loss of meat significantly decreased by ultrasound treatment compared with untreated meat. Lower cooking loss and MORS at the optimal condition were beneficial to meet the satisfaction of consumer and producers for meat factory.

The enzymatic properties of Asterias rubens and Nephthys hombergii lysozymes were compared with those of hen egg-white lysozyme. The results allowed to conclude that the Asterias rubens lysozyme was representative of a new lysozyme type. The Nephthys hombergii lysozyme however could be classified among the hen type enzymes with a tendency to exhibit under certain conditions some properties attributed to the goose type lysozymes.

Many migrating herbivores rely on plant biomass to fuel their life cycles and have adapted to following changes in plant quality through time. The green wave hypothesis predicts that herbivorous waterfowl will follow the wave of food availability and quality during their spring migration. However, testing this hypothesis is hampered by the large geographical range these birds cover. The satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series is an ideal proxy indicator for the development of plant biomass and quality across a broad spatial area. A derived index, the green wave index (GWI), has been successfully used to link altitudinal and latitudinal migration of mammals to spatio-temporal variations in food quality and quantity. To date, this index has not been used to test the green wave hypothesis for individual avian herbivores. Here, we use the satellite-derived GWI to examine the green wave hypothesis with respect to GPS-tracked individual barnacle geese from three flyway populations (Russian n = 12, Svalbard n = 8, and Greenland n = 7). Data were collected over three years (2008-2010). Our results showed that the Russian and Svalbard barnacle geese followed the middle stage of the green wave (GWI 40-60%), while the Greenland geese followed an earlier stage (GWI 20-40%). Despite these differences among geese populations, the phase of vegetation greenness encountered by the GPS-tracked geese was close to the 50% GWI (i.e. the assumed date of peak nitrogen concentration), thereby implying that barnacle geese track high quality food during their spring migration. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the migration of individual avian herbivores has been successfully studied with respect to vegetation phenology using the satellite-derived GWI. Our results offer further support for the green wave hypothesis applying to long-distance migrants on a larger scale.

The demography of many European waterbirds is not well understood because most countries have conducted little monitoring and assessment, and coordination among countries on waterbird management has little precedent. Yet intergovernmental treaties now mandate the use of sustainable, adaptive harvest strategies, whose development is challenged by a paucity of demographic information. In this study, we explore how a combination of allometric relationships, fragmentary monitoring and research information, and expert judgment can be used to estimate the parameters of a theta-logistic population model, which in turn can be used in a Markov decision process to derive optimal harvesting strategies. We show how to account for considerable parametric uncertainty, as well as for different management objectives. We illustrate our methodology with a poorly understood population of Taiga Bean Geese (Anser fabalis fabalis), which is a popular game bird in Fennoscandia. Our results for Taiga Bean Geese suggest that they may have demographic rates similar to other, well-studied species of geese, and our model-based predictions of population size are consistent with the limited monitoring information available. Importantly, we found that by using a Markov decision process, a simple scalar population model may be sufficient to guide harvest management of this species, even if its demography is age structured. Finally, we demonstrated how two different management objectives can lead to very different optimal harvesting strategies, and how conflicting objectives may be traded off with each other. This approach will have broad application for European waterbirds by providing preliminary estimates of key demographic parameters, by providing insights into the monitoring and research activities needed to corroborate those estimates, and by producing harvest management strategies that are optimal with respect to the managers' objectives, options, and available demographic information.

Intrinsic choroidal neurons (ICN) represent a peculiar feature of eyes in higher primates and birds. They account for up to 2000 in human and duck eyes but are virtually absent or rare in all other mammalian species investigated so far. It has been suggested that ICN are involved in regulation of ocular blood supply, hence influencing intraocular pressure, and changes in choroidal thickness, thus influencing accommodation. The present study was undertaken in order to compare differences in various avian species with respect to ICN as well as to provide data on some avian species relevant for experimental ophthalmic research, i.e. chicken and quail. Choroids from 12 avian species were processed for NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry or, in some cases, neuronal nitric oxide synthase immunocytochemistry. ICN were quantified and normalized to mean choroidal area. Three choroids of each galliformes (i.e. chicken, quail, turkey) and anseriformes (i.e. Muscovy duck, Mallard duck, goose) were rastered in squares of 1 mm2 and x/y coordinates were transferred into a 3D-diagram with the amount of ICN represented in the z-axis. ICN were detected in all species investigated. They were predominantly small cells with soma diameters of 20-30 microm. In turkey, and to a lesser amount in chicken, a subpopulation of ICN with somal diameters of up to 70 microm was observed. Highest mean cell counts were found in goose (6195.4; turkey 3558.4; chicken 1681.4; Muscovy duck 785.4; Mallard duck 640.8; quail 440.2). Normalized to choroidal area, highest mean cell counts were (per mm2): 12.62 in goose, 4.42 in both chicken and turkey, 2.86 in quail, 2.66 in Mallard duck and 1.89 in Muscovy duck. In galliformes, ICN were found to be accumulated temporo-cranial, while in anseriformes they were arranged in a more belt-like fashion, passing from cranio-nasal to temporo-caudal. Our results show that besides Muscovy duck, other avian species appear as suitable models for further functional experiments on ICN. The temporo-cranial accumulation of ICN in galliformes and the belt-like arrangement in anseriformes may reflect special functional requirements in regions of high visual acuity.

Crystallins from pigeon eye lenses were isolated and purified by gel-permeation chromatography and characterized by gel electrophoresis, amino-acid composition and sequence analysis. Alpha- and beta-crystallins could be obtained in relatively pure forms by single-step size-exclusion chromatography whereas an extra step of ion-exchange chromatography was needed for the separation of delta-crystallin from the beta-crystallin fraction. In contrast to most characterized vertebrate species, a large amount of glycogen is eluted as a high molecular form in the first peak of the gel filtration column. Pigeon delta-crystallin, similar to duck and reptilian delta-crystallins, exists as a tetrameric structure of about 200 kDa in the native form and is composed of one major subunit of 50 kDa with heterogeneous isoelectric points spreading in a range of 4.7 to 6.8. In contrast to those obtained from duck, goose and caiman, delta-crystallin isolated from the pigeon lens possessed very little argininosuccinate lyase activity. However, pigeon delta-crystallin can still cross-react with the antibody against enzymically active duck delta-crystallin as revealed by the sensitive immunoblotting technique. It was also shown that the delta-crystallin content of the total pigeon soluble proteins decreased with the age of the animal. Structural analysis of purified delta-crystallin fraction was made with respect to its amino-acid composition and protein primary sequence. N-terminal sequence analysis indicated the presence of blocked amino-termini in all crystallin fractions of pigeon lenses. Therefore, a sequence analysis of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplified delta-crystallin cDNA was employed to deduce the protein sequence of this crystallin. Structural comparison of delta-crystallin sequences from pigeon, chicken and duck lenses casts some doubts on the recent claim that His-89-->Gln mutation in the chicken delta-crystallin may account for the loss of argininosuccinate lyase activity in this avian species, as compared to high enzymic activity in the duck crystallin (Barbosa et al. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 5286-5290).

An experiment was carried out using three cubs of the arctic fox (Alopex lagopus). Twenty-five-day-old cubs were infected by feeding them with the leg muscles of the white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons) containing Sarcocystis sp. (cyst type III) cysts. Under the light microscope, the cysts were ribbon-shaped up to 4 mm long and up to 750 microm wide. On the surface of the wall (up to 2.4 microm), they had teat- or finger-like villar protrusions. Ultrastructurally, the cyst wall was a type-9 with villar protrusions (up to 2.3 microm long) different in size. The 11.4x1.7 (10.0-13.5x1.5-2.5)microm cystozoites were almost straight and shuttle-shaped. The fox cubs started shedding typical 12.0x8.0 (10.0-12.8x6.8-8.6)microm Sarcocystis sp. sporocysts on the 13th-14th days post-infection. The patent period lasted 19 days. The conclusion drawn was that the arctic fox (A. lagopus) can be one of the definitive hosts of Sarcocystis sp. (cyst type III) from the white-fronted goose.

The structure of follicular layer of growing and atretic follicles in the ovary of the domestic goose, was studied by electron microscopy. In small follicles, the wall is lined with a narrow layer of tightly packed small, cuboidal cells separated from the thecal tissue by the basal lamina. During growth, they transform into tall, columnar cells arranged in a single row. The cells display several peculiar ultrastructural features. First, annulate lamellae are commonly observed. Second, cytoplasmic dense-cored granules accumulate in close association with fenestrated cisternae and networks of tubuli derived from the RER. They consist of spheres and strands of amorphous substance of unknown origin. Third, the cells contain many transosomes, a unique organelle of the avian follicle cell consisting of a dense plaque associated with ribosome-like particles. The mature forms of transosomes are located at the tips of lateral and apical cell projections, while bodies thought to be their precursors, are found in the apical cytoplasm. In follicles larger than 8 mm in diameter, most of the transosomes and their precursors have disappeared. Follicular atresia occurs in all of the size-classes of follicles investigated. A loss of transosomes (in follicles up to 8 mm in diameter) and an accumulation of lipid droplets, are the first atretic events detectable by electron microscopy. Morphologic features, including deep nuclear indentations, accumulation of lipid droplets frequently encircled by membrane whorls, dilation and disintegration of RER cisterns, swelling of mitochondria and accumulation of dense irregular masses of unknown origin in the cytoplasm, are taken as evidence for advanced degradation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).

The experiment comprised 100 chickens, 100 ducks and 100 geese fed diets based on mixed grains of maize, barley and wheat. Nutrient concentrations in the mixtures were in accordance with the requirements of poultry species. The birds were kept in metabolic cages from the 1st up to the 42nd day of life. The measurements of body weight, activity of alpha-amylase and lipase in pancreatic tissue, enzymatic activity of intestinal wall cells, parameters of carbohydrate fermentations, ileal and total amino acids digestibility were conducted on the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 28th and 42nd day of life or on the 14th, 28th and 42nd day of life. The pancreas alpha-amylase activity in chickens during the whole period was quite constant; in ducks and geese it was very low, but from the 28th day a dynamic increase in the activity of the pancreatic enzymes was observed in these birds. The activity of lipase was low but from the 28th day of experiment an increase was noted and was much higher in waterfowl than in chickens. The highest caecal concentration of SCFA (Short chain fatty acids) (in total high) was noted in chickens; these values were slightly lower in geese and ducks. A high (70%) ileal amino acids digestibility was seen in very young chickens; during the period of 15-42 days this value amounted up to 73%. In geese, the obtained values were 63% and in ducks 43-61%, with a mean of 55%. Faecal digestibility of amino acids had a mean of up to 86% for all species but the digestibility of single amino acids such as cystine, glycine, histidine and tyrosine was diversified and relatively lower than the others.

Two structurally distinct forms of eggwhite lysozyme (EC 3.2.1.17) are known. The egg white of some species contains both of these forms, while the egg white of other species appears to contain only one or the other of them. We have immunological and electrophoretic evidence that the chicken, which has only one lysozyme type in its egg white, contains both types in its polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Experiments on Embden goose bone marrow showed that this tissue also contains both lysozymes, even though the egg white of this species contains only one of them. Our studies suggest that many avian species have the genetic loci that code for both forms of lysozyme, but that a species-specific regulatory mechanism controls whether one or the other or both of them are expressed during egg white production. The fact that two distinct lysozymes are present in chicken leukocytes may be of significance to the antibacterial mechanism of these cells, especially in light of the fact that they lack myeloperoxidase, an important leukocyte enzyme in mammals.

Iodine-based solutions have long been known to be effective in aiding the differentiation among soft tissues in both fundamental anatomical research and for clinical diagnoses. Recently the combination of this particular contrasting agent with micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) has resulted in an array of high-quality image data, in which anatomical structures not visible in conventional CT can be identified and quantified. However, there has been only limited data available to inform detailed protocols for staining large specimens. Further, modeling of the staining mechanism has focused on simple diffusion processes.

Five ganders were subjected to an experimental fast comparable to that which spontaneously occurs during breeding in domestic geese, and during migration and breeding in various wild birds. Plasma uric acid and urea concentrations, and their excretion as a proportion of total nitrogen excretion, were studied in relation to daily change in body mass per unit body mass, mg/mdt. This variable has previously been found to reflect changes in protein catabolism over the three phases of fast: I, dm/mdt and protein utilization both decrease; II, they are maintained at a low value; and III, they increase. In the fed state, daily total nitrogen excretion was 5 gN X 24 h-1; uric acid, ammonia and urea accounted for 51, 15 and 5% respectively. The high remaining proportion of excreted nitrogen (29%), after subtraction of uric acid-N, ammonia-N and urea-N to total nitrogen, accords with the literature. During fasting, the changes in daily excretion of uric acid, urea, ammonia and total nitrogen followed a pattern essentially similar to that for dm/mdt. Uric acid accounted for a progressively increasing fraction of total nitrogen, up to 76% at the end of phase III, while urea remained at a constant 5%. Plasma concentrations of both uric acid and urea followed similar trends during the fast, in particular both increasing during phase III, i.e. when there was a rise in nitrogen excretion. This suggests they could be used as an index in field investigations, to determine whether birds which naturally fast in connection with specific activities have entered into the situation where proteins are no longer spared.

The biting activity and host attractancy of vector mosquitoes are important in assessing the risk of arbovirus transmission, especially where migratory and nonmigrating bird species congregate, such as in Hulun Lake, Manzhouli. In 2009, the population distribution, species diversity, biting activity, and host attractancy of mosquitoes were investigated in Hulan Lake and its associated prairie area. The adult mosquitoes were captured either by human volunteers using aspirators in mosquito nets, by CO2-baited light traps, or by animal-baited traps. In total, 27,004 mosquitoes, representing three genera and 10 species, were collected from Manzhouli, China, in July 2009, of which Aedes dorsalis (Meigen) were most predominant species, followed by Ae. vexans (Meigen). Biting activity peaks by Ae.flavescens (Muller), Ae. dorsalis, and Culex modestus (Facalbi) on human subjects were investigated. Four mosquito species were captured from different animal sheds (sheep, cattle, and goose). Ae. flavescens was more abundant in the cattle shed than in the other two sheds. The Ae. dorsalis in the sheep shed was much higher than in the other animal sheds. The Ae.flavescens collected via chicken-baited traps were significantly higher than those collected via rabbit-baited and pigeon-baited traps. There were no significant differences in the number of Ae. dorsalis and Ae. vexans collected using the three different animal traps.

We investigated the histological structure of the graylag goose (Anser anser) gall bladder. Sections of the gall bladder were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E), Alcian blue (pH 2.5) for acid mucopolysaccharides, Gomori's method for reticular fibers, Masson's trichrome, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Verhoeff's elastin stain. The goose gall bladder was composed of a tunica mucosa, tunica muscularis and tunica adventitia or tunica serosa. The tunica mucosa formed regularly distributed simple isometric folds plus larger, less numerous, branched folds. The luminal surface was lined by tall columnar epithelial cells that stained for both acid and neutral mucopolysaccharides. The epithelial cells formed a discontinuous striated border of interdigitating microvilli on the luminal surface. Neither a lamina muscularis nor goblet cells were observed in the tunica mucosa. Unusual findings included branched mucosal folds, discontinuous microvilli and absence of an outer longitudinal layer in the tunica muscularis. No marked sex-associated differences were found. The general histochemical and histological structures of the graylag goose gall bladder are similar to those of birds such as chukar partridge and quail, but with some unique elements that may reflect differences in organ function.

Lysozyme (LZ), a bacteriolytic enzyme, is found in the egg white of many avian eggs and plays an important role in host defense; however, LZ activity in emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) egg white is exceptionally undetectable. We cloned and characterized emu goose-type LZ (LZG) and chicken-type LZ (LZC) genes. RT-PCR analysis revealed very low LZG gene expression levels and absence of LZC gene expression in the emu oviduct. Sequencing of full-length LZG and LZC cDNAs indicated that their amino acid sequences show high similarities to ostrich LZG and LZC, respectively, with conserved catalytic residues for enzymatic activities. Whereas recombinant emu LZG prepared using Pichia pastoris exhibited similar enzyme activity as ostrich LZG, recombinant emu LZC exhibited significantly higher lytic activity than chicken LZC. We concluded that emus have functional genes for both LZG and LZC like many other avians, and the LZG gene is expressed in oviduct probably as in other ratite, however, its expression levels in egg white were low to be detected.

The Huoyan goose is famous for its high egg-laying performance and is listed as a nationally protected domestic animal by the Chinese government. To elucidate the key regulatory genes involved in Huoyan goose egg laying, RNA from ovarian tissue during the ceased and laying periods was sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing platform. More than 12 million reads were produced in ceased and laying libraries that included 11,896,423 and 12,534,799 clean reads, respectively. More than 20% of the reads were matched to the reference genome, and 23% of the reads were matched to reference genes. Genes with a false discovery rate (FDR) ≤0.001 and log2ratio ≧1 or ≤-1 were characterized as differentially expressed, and 344 up-regulated and 344 down-regulated genes were classified into functional categories. Twelve genes that are mainly involved in pathways for reproduction regulation, such as steroid hormone biosynthesis, GnRH signaling pathways, oocyte meiosis, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, steroid biosynthesis, calcium signaling pathways, and G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway were selected for validation by a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis, the qRT-PCR results are consistent with the general expression patterns of those genes from the Illumina sequencing. These data provide comprehensive gene expression information at the transcriptional level that might increase our understanding of the Huoyan goose's reproductive biology.

Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-PCR (ERIC-PCR) is a molecular biological technology that can be used to study microbial community diversity and dynamics. In many reports, investigations of microbial diversity from environmental samples were based on the agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE) patterns of ERIC-PCR amplified products. This is not a sound practice, since bands with identical positions can contain different sequences; thus, this practice could possibly exaggerate the similarities or diversities among samples. To mitigate this issue, we employed a denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) strategy to explore DNA bands with the same size, between ERIC-PCR profiles of samples. DPS software was used with Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H') to analyze ERIC-PCR fingerprint profiles. H' revealed that the microbial community diversity at DGGE was higher than with AGE. The results of this study suggest that the ERIC-PCR assays with DGGE can provide a better assessment of electrophoresis pattern with regards to the structure of an intestinal microbial community.

Herbivory and climate are key environmental drivers, shaping ecosystems at high latitudes. Here, we focus on how these two drivers act in concert, influencing the high arctic tundra. We aim to investigate mechanisms through which herbivory by geese influences vegetation and soil processes in tundra ecosystems under ambient and warmed conditions. To achieve this, two grazing treatments, clipping plus faecal additions and moss removal, were implemented in conjunction with passive warming. Our key finding was that, in many cases, the tundra ecosystem response was determined by treatment impacts on the moss layer. Moss removal reduced the remaining moss layer depth by 30% and increased peak grass biomass by 27%. These impacts were probably due to observed higher soil temperatures and decomposition rates associated with moss removal. The positive impact of moss removal on grass biomass was even greater with warming, further supporting this conclusion. In contrast, moss removal reduced dwarf shrub biomass possibly resulting from increased exposure to desiccating winds. An intact moss layer buffered the soil to increased air temperature and as a result there was no response of vascular plant productivity to warming over the course of this study. In fact, moss removal impacts on soil temperature were nearly double those of warming, suggesting that the moss layer is a key component in controlling soil conditions. The moss layer also absorbed nutrients from faeces, promoting moss growth. We conclude that both herbivory and warming influence this high arctic ecosystem but that herbivory is the stronger driver of the two. Disturbance to the moss layer resulted in a shift towards a more grass-dominated system with less abundant mosses and shrubs, a trend that was further enhanced by warming. Thus herbivore impacts to the moss layer are key to understanding arctic ecosystem response to grazing and warming.

Measuring hormone metabolites from excreta is a powerful method to study hormone-behavior relationships. Currently, fecal corticosterone metabolite concentrations are used to estimate individual short-term stress responses. From the free-roaming, semitame flock of greylag geese (Anser anser), as many fecal samples as possible were collected over 3 h following a challenge (social density stress) or in a control situation. This time span corresponds to the gut passage time of geese. It was asked how many samples were necessary to determine differences in excreted corticosterone immunoreactive metabolites (CORTs) between control and social density stress and which parameters (means, maxima, range) reliably showed this difference. A large variation of CORT was found between consecutive samples. Still, means, maxima, and ranges of the samples in a fecal series consistently showed the response to a stressor both within and between individuals. Three samples sufficed if the maximum value of CORT was used, whereas four or more samples were necessary to work with the mean. It was concluded that by increasing the number of fecal samples collected, the course of CORT could be measured more precisely and an individual's acute stress response inferred more reliably.

Early embryonic mortality and chromosome abnormalities were studied in three goose lines: Grey Landes (line 7), White Polish (line 4) and their synthetic line (line 9). Eggs laid at the beginning, in the middle and at the end of the laying season were set. At candling at 5th day after egg set, all eggs (2847) were examined and those showing no normal embryonic development were opened 2847. Dead embryos were classified phenotypically and karyotyped. The mean ratio of embryonic mortality (EM) among fertile eggs was 9.4%, 5.2%, 7.3% in the lines 4, 7 and 9, respectively. The mean ratio of embryos with chromosomal abnormalities (CA) among the dead embryos was 8.0%, 14.8% and 13.1% in the lines 4, 7 and 9, respectively. Gander effect and layer within gander effect on embryo mortality were significant, indicating genetic factors. Father and mother of the layer effects were also significant, showing family effects. Animals producing dead embryos and embryos with chromosome abnormalities in high proportion were selected. In the selected groups the mean EM was 17.7-22.9%, and the mean CA was 11.7-34.7% among the three lines. The repetition of CA was not observed in the reproductive season of following year, while animals repeated the high EM (repeatability coefficient of 0.54). This shows that some part of EM may be resulted from other genetic factors. Ganders and layers progeny of these selected animals showed also high EM. It was concluded that culling pairs giving high EM value in their embryos could increase the average level of embryo viability and that the study of genetic determinism of that trait should be continued in geese.

Spontaneous unit activity was recorded in the posteromedial hypothalamic (PMH) and preventricular magnocellular (PVM) nuclei, septal area (S) and hippocampal formation (Hp). Modifications of cellular firing induced by lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) stimulation were examined. Both thiopental anaesthetized and chronic non anaesthetized geese were used. Thiopental appeared to significantly decrease the spontaneous discharge frequency of PMH neurons, and to block both orthodromic and antidromic activations elicited by LHA stimulation. The results indicated that LHA has a predominantly inhibitory influence on PMH as well as on PVM and septal area. The study of antidromic evoked responses in the four areas investigated (PMH, PVM, S, Hp) demonstrated that these structures in turn exert a feed-back control onto LHA. These results are compared with previous electrophysiological, anatomical and behavioral feeding data and an attempt is made to establish some comparisons between birds and mammals.

Five erythrocyte species (horse, goose, chicken, guinea pig, and human) were used to agglutinate avian influenza H5N1 viruses by hemagglutination assay and to detect specific antibody by hemagglutination inhibition test. We found that goose erythrocytes confer a greater advantage over other erythrocyte species in both assays.

As part of a comparative study of egg yolk from different avian species, the major lipoprotein and its mixed apoproteins from the egg yolk of the chinese goose (Anser cygnoides) have been prepared. From the apoprotein mixture, two new proteins, of molecular weight approximately 10000 and 22000 according to gel electrophoresis in detergent, have been isolated by gel-filtration chromatography in urea. The protein of lower molecular weight corresponds in amino acid sequence to apovitellenin I, a protein previously isolated from other avian species. As a comparison with other members of the same avian family (Anatidae), the amino acid sequence of apovitellenin I from the pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos) was re-investigated and that of the muscovy duck (Cairina moschata) investigated. These were found to be identical to the sequence of goose's apovitellenin I. The second new protein is similar in composition, molecular weight, and solubility to apovitellenin II, a protein present in small amount in hen's egg yolk. A protein corresponding to apovitellenin II could not, however, be detected in the egg yolk of either species of duck.

Trichodinid ciliophorans are opportunistic parasites of many species of fish, amphibians, and molluscs, but yet never reported in association with lesions in birds. Postmortem and histopathological evaluation of a commercial adult Toulouse gander and female goose, and a wild Mallard drake revealed the presence of severe pathological parasitic colonization of their reproductive tracts. Histopathological findings included moderate to severe granulocytic inflammation, acanthosis, accentuation of the rete pegs, and proliferative hyperplastic squamous metaplasia of the mucosa of the ejaculatory ducts and groove, sulcus spermaticus, glandular part of the phallus (cavum penis), and oviduct in association with large numbers of ciliated protozoa anchored to the tissues or free in the lumen. These protozoa had characteristic morphological features analogous to the family of Trichodinidae. The source of this parasitism could not be determined. To our knowledge, this is the first report of trichodinosis associated with pathology in birds.

Pathogenicity of two avian poxviruses isolated from endangered Hawaiian wild birds, the Hawaiian Goose and the Palila, was compared with fowl poxvirus in chickens. Immune responses were measured by ELISA pre- and postimmunization with Hawaiian poxviruses and after challenge with fowl poxvirus. Both isolates from Hawaiian birds developed only a localized lesion of short duration at the site of inoculation in specific-pathogen-free chickens and did not provide protection against subsequent challenge with virulent fowl poxvirus. On the other hand, birds inoculated with virulent fowl poxvirus developed severe lesions. In contrast to high antibody response in chickens immunized with fowl poxvirus, birds immunized with either of the two Hawaiian isolates developed low to moderate antibody responses against viral antigens. The level of immune responses, however, increased in birds of all groups following subsequent challenge.

Short beak and dwarfism syndrome (SBDS) was caused by novel goose parvovirus (NGPV)--a variant of goose parvovirus (GPV). Ducks infected with NGPV shows clinical signs including growth retardation and protrusion of the tongue from an atrophied beak. SBDS outbreak was first reported at the northern coastal provinces of China during 2015 and it was again reported in Sichuan, an inland province of China in 2016. The disease caused a huge economic loss in Chinese duck feeding industry.

1. The low reproductive performance of geese has seriously hampered the development of the industry. Reproductive performance, particularly the egg laying rate mainly depends on the development of the follicle. Previous studies have shown that follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) plays an important role in the process of follicular development, but the exact underlying mechanism remains unclear. 2. This study showed that FSH stimulated granulosa cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of FSH treatment on granulosa cell proliferation was greatest at a dose of 100 mIU/ml FSH for 24 h. 3. Secondly, the effect of different concentrations of FSH on goose granulosa cell proliferation was investigated, and de novo transcriptome assembly and gene expression analysis performed using short-read sequencing technology (Illumina). High-throughput sequencing results yielded 62.61 M reads and 7.8 G base pairs from granulosa cells treated with 100 mIU/ml FSH. These reads were assembled into 65,757 unigenes (mean length: 705 bp) with an N50 of 903 bp. A total of 110 upregulated and 510 downregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by RNA-seq. 4. Functional analysis by gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway annotation indicated that hormone biosynthesis (GO:0042446), positive regulation of hormone secretion (GO:0046887), steroid biosynthesis, oxidative phosphorylation and carbon metabolism pathways were involved in FSH-mediated proliferation of goose granulosa cells. 5. After screening, a group of key responsive genes including superoxide dismutase 1, fatty acyl-CoA reductase 1, transforming growth factor-beta receptor-associated protein 1 and follistatin were tested by real-time reverse transcription PCR to confirm differential expression in granulosa cells stimulated by FSH. 6. FSH-stimulated goose granulosa cells and DEG profiling data provided comprehensive gene expression information at the transcriptional level that could promote better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying follicle development in response to FSH stimulation.

Seasonal changes in plasma levels of LH and GH in the Canada goose (Branta canadensis interior) have been studied. The population examined breeds in the Canadian subarctic region (Fort Churchill, Manitoba) and winters in the southern United States (Swan Lake Refuge, Missouri). Peak levels of LH were observed during spring postmigratory (nestbuilding, early May) and nesting (incubating, early June) periods, while no significant differences were observed during the other periods studied. The highest levels of GH were observed during molting (late July) and the immediately following fall premigratory (early September) period.

Experimental infections enabled to test susceptibility of the goose and duck to M. avium. After intramuscular implantation of M. avium suspension, local lesions were observed at the spot of puncture in the geese, and miliary tuberculosis of spleen in 35 days, as well as miliary tuberculosis of liver after 69 days. In the ducks, local lesions were found at the spot of puncture in 35 days and miliary tuberculosis of liver and spleen in 69 days. Cultivation demonstrated mycobacteria in various tissues and organs since day 12 after infection. Peroral infection with contaminated feed caused lesions in spleen and intestine in the geese in 106 days, and then in liver and lungs in 133 days. The ducks had lesions in the intestine in 106 days, and in liver and spleen in 133 and 136 days, resp. Cultivation proved sporadic mycobacteria in liver, spleen, lungs and/or bone marrow and brain in both species. No tuberculous lesions were observed in the geese or ducks within 253 days of the experiment after infections by contacts with the TBC fowl. Cultivation demonstrated sporadic mycobacteria in liver, spleen, kidneys, lungs and bone marrow. The goose and the duck are very resistant to M. avium infection. The duck seems to be less susceptible than the duck.

This study presents concentrations of heavy metals (iron, zinc, manganese, copper, lead and cadmium) in livers of white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons), eurasian wigeons (Anas penelope), mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and spot-billed ducks (Anas poecilorhyncha) from Korea in February 2006 and 2008. Iron concentrations were significantly lower in spot-billed ducks than in other species (ANOVA, p<0.001). Zinc concentrations were greater in white-fronted geese and spot-billed ducks than in eurasian wigeons and mallards (ANOVA, p<0.001). Manganese and copper concentrations in white-fronted geese were significantly higher than in other species (ANOVA, p<0.001). Cadmium concentrations were significantly higher in mallards and spot-billed ducks than in white-fronted geese (ANOVA, p=0.007). However, lead concentrations did not differ among species. Iron, zinc, manganese and copper concentrations from this study were within the range of other waterfowl studies. Therefore, we suggest that essential elements such as iron, zinc, manganese and copper are within normal range and are maintained there by normal homeostatic mechanism. Twenty individuals (29.0 percent) exceeded the threshold level for abnormal lead exposure (5 μg/g dry weight) in waterfowl in this study and it is a higher proportion than in herons, egrets and owls from Korea. We suggest that the result was attributed to ingestion of lead shot and sinkers. However, cadmium concentrations in waterfowl except one specimen were within the background concentrations for wild birds. In livers of four waterfowl species found in Korea, lead and cadmium concentrations were similar to previously reported in other geese and ducks; except for poisoning of lead shot or sinkers as shown in earlier studies.

Substrate binding subsites of barley chitinase and goose egg white lysozyme were comparatively investigated by kinetic analysis using N-acetylglucosamine oligosaccharide as the substrate. The enzymatic hydrolysis of hexasaccharide was monitored by HPLC, and the reaction time-course was analyzed by the mathematical model, in which six binding subsites (B, C, D, E, F, and G) and bond cleavage between sites D and E are postulated. In this model, all of the possible binding modes of substrate and products are taken into consideration assuming a rapid equilibrium in the oligosaccharide binding processes. To estimate the binding free energy changes of the subsites, time-course calculation was repeated with changing the free energy values of individual subsites, until the calculated time-course was sufficiently fitted to the experimental one. The binding free energy changes of the six binding subsites, B, C, D, E, F and G, which could give a calculated time-course best fitted to the experimental, were 0.0, -5.0, +4.1, -0.5, -3.8, and -2.0 kcal/mol for barley chitinase, and -0.5, -2.2, +4.2, -1.5, -2.6, and -2.8 kcal/mol for goose egg white lysozyme. The binding mode predicted from the p-nitrophenyl-penta-N-acetylchitopentaoside splitting pattern for each enzyme was also analyzed by the identical subsite model. Using the free energy values listed above, the binding mode distribution calculated was fitted to the experimental with a slight modification of free energy value at site G. We concluded that the binding subsite model described above reflects the substantial mechanism of substrate binding for both enzymes. The relatively large disparity in free energy value at site C between these enzymes may be due to the different secondary structures of polypeptide segments interacting with the sugar residue at site C.

Baseline glucocorticoid (CORT) levels in plasma are increasingly used as physiological indices of the relative condition or health of individuals and populations. The major limitation is that CORT production is stimulated by the stress associated with capture and handling. Measuring fecal CORT is one way to solve this problem because elevation of fecal CORT usually does not occur before 1-12h after a stressful event in captive animals. However, the effect of capture and handling on fecal CORT levels has seldom been investigated in the wild. In a first experiment, we validated that fecal CORT levels starts to increase in droppings (a mixture of fecal and urinary material) about 1-2h following injection of CORT-release hormone (ACTH) in captive greater snow geese (Chen caerulescens atlantica). In a second experiment, we investigated whether dropping and plasma CORT were related and if the capture affected fecal CORT levels in wild birds. Baseline CORT was obtained by bleeding individuals within 4 min after capture. No relationship was found between baseline and CORT in droppings shortly after capture (<4 min). In addition, CORT levels in droppings increased linearly with time after capture and was already elevated by a factor two 40 min after capture. The different turnover time of CORT between urine and feces could explain such results. We conclude that droppings cannot provide an index of basal CORT levels in snow geese captured in the wild. Such a result contrast with previous studies conducted on habituated, captive animals. We thus recommend that use of droppings as a non-invasive technique to measure baseline CORT be restricted to non-manipulated individuals in the wild.

The three-dimensional structure of goose-type lysozyme (GEWL), determined by x-ray crystallography and refined at high resolution, has similarities to the structures of hen (chicken) egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) and bacteriophage T4 lysozyme (T4L). The nature of the structural correspondence suggests that all three classes of lysozyme diverged from a common evolutionary precursor, even though their amino acid sequences appear to be unrelated (Grütter et al. 1983). In this paper we make detailed comparisons of goose-type, chicken-type, and phage-type lysozymes. The lysozymes have undergone conformational changes at both the global and the local level. As in the globins, there are corresponding alpha-helices that have rigid-body displacements relative to each other, but in some cases corresponding helices have increased or decreased in length, and in other cases there are helices in one structure that have no counterpart in another. Independent of the overall structural correspondence among the three lysozyme backbones is another, distinct correspondence between a set of three consecutive alpha-helices in GEWL and three consecutive alpha-helices in T4L. This structural correspondence could be due, in part, to a common energetically favorable contact between the first and the third helices. There are similarities in the active sites of the three lysozymes, but also one striking difference. Glu 73 (GEWL) spatially corresponds to Glu 35 (HEWL) and to Glu 11 (T4L). On the other hand, there are two aspartates in the GEWL active site, Asp 86 and Asp 97, neither of which corresponds exactly to Asp 52 (HEWL) or Asp 20 (T4L). (The discrepancy in the location of the carboxyl groups is about 10 A for Asp 86 and 4 A for Asp 97.) This lack of structural correspondence may reflect some differences in the mechanisms of action of the three lysozymes. When the amino acid sequences of the three lysozyme types are aligned according to their structural correspondence, there is still no apparent relationship between the sequences except for possible weak matching in the vicinity of the active sites.

Compared to other domestic bird species, geese exhibit the lowest reproductive efficiency (poor semen quality, low egg production, and poor fertility and hatchability rates). From an economic perspective, it is a necessity of improve these reproductive traits. Studies have demonstrated that the essential trace element-selenium-plays key roles in testicular development and the maintenance of spermatogenesis. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of feed supplementation with organic selenium and vitamin E on ganders' response to manual semen collection and semen quality. Sixteen 3-year-old White Koluda ganders were randomly divided into two groups. The control group was provided commercial feed while the experimental group was provided with the same commercial feed supplemented with selenium (0.3 mg/kg) and vitamin E (100 mg/kg). The response of individual ganders from both groups to manual semen collection and the quality of the semen collected were evaluated. The supplements increased (P ≤ 0.05) the frequency and decreased the time interval of a complete ejaculatory response of the ganders to manual semen collections (82.7 % supplement vs. 73.5 % control). Males from the supplemented group had significantly higher (P ≤ 0.01; P ≤ 0.05) ejaculate volumes, sperm concentrations, and percentages of viable sperm and lower percentages of immature sperm (spermatids). Lipids peroxidation, expressed in terms of the malondialdehyde concentration, was lower (P ≤ 0.01) in semen of the supplemented group (0.172 nmol/50 × 10(6)) as compared to the controls (0.320 nmol/50 × 10(6)). Moreover, the duration of the reproductive period of the ganders in the experimental group was 1 week longer. The results show that supplemental dietary selenium and vitamin E improved both the ganders' response to manual semen collection and semen quality. We conclude that such feed supplementation could lead to greater economic benefits through increased reproductive efficiency within the goose production industry.

The seasonal variation of the plasma testosterone level of domestic ganders--living under natural photoperiod in Central Hungary--shows a bimodal rhythmicity. An experimental group of ganders within a photorefractory period was exposed to continuous low light intensity (1 lx/m2) from the middle of July until the beginning of August. They were then kept under natural daylight (14.5 L-9.5 D), and then had extra light (14 L-10 D) until the end of the experiment (end of November). The testis weight and the plasma concentration of testosterone were increased significantly as a result of low light intensity but failed to reach the seasonal (February) peak. Having readjusted the birds to natural photoperiod the testosterone plasma concentration did not continue to increase, but decreased slowly for 44 days (16 September). Between the 44th and 52nd day of the experiment (24 September) the testosterone concentration was reduced to the level of the control animals, which were maintained under natural photoperiod. It was established that the photorefractory period had not been terminated by 3 weeks' low light intensity, but a moderate gonadostimulation had occurred. Since photostimulation did not increase the plasma testosterone, but a superactive LH-RH analog increased it significantly in birds which had been in low light intensity, it is supposed that the cause of the refractoriness in ganders may also be decreased gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion.

Information on the blood parasites occurring in 3,866 anatids of 14 species collected from five locations in Alberta and Saskatchewan during 1976-80 is summarized. An overall prevalence of 26% with avian hematozoa was recorded. Leucocytozoon simondi was the most frequently encountered parasite, occurring in 17% of the ducks; Haemoproteus nettionis was observed in 11% of the birds while Plasmodium circumflexum and microfilariae (probably of Splendidofilaria fallisensis) occurred in only 2% and less than 1% of the sample respectively. Overall prevalence of infection in both immatures and adults was similar, although the sample was heavily biased in favor of the immature age class. While the overall prevalence of L. simondi was similar in both age classes, H. nettionis occurred twice as frequently in the adult birds. Infection prevalences of birds in the five geographic areas sampled were different and these differences are discussed. Prevalences also differed from year to year in birds from the various areas and these differences are attributed, in part, to the water levels encountered each year. Leucocytozoon simondi is considered a potentially limiting factor for waterfowl production in some areas of northern Alberta and Saskatchewan.

Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) has an important role in regulating cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. It, however, is still unclear as to the mechanisms by which BMP4 regulates the apoptosis of granulosa cells (GCs) in geese. In the present study, there was cloning of the full-length coding sequence of goose BMP4 gene, which consisted of 1212 nucleotides encoding 403 amino acids. Its deduced amino acid sequence comprised one signal peptide, one TGFβ pro-peptide and one mature peptide domain. Results from conducting the quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) indicated the relative abundances of BMP4 mRNA in geese GCs increased gradually from the relative abundances in pre-hierarchical follicles that were 4 to 6 mm in diameter to that in the fifth largest (F5) follicle and then relative abundances of BMP4 mRNA decreased with further development as the largest (F1) follicle. Results from use of the TUNEL assay indicated that overexpression of the goose BMP4 gene suppressed GC apoptosis and this was confirmed when relative abundances of the CAD, Caspase-9 and Caspase-3 proteins were determined using western blotting. In addition, overexpression of the BMP4 gene induced phosphorylation of AKT, which was inhibited with use of the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002. Co-transfection of BMP4 and LY294002 resulted in increased relative abundances of Caspase-9 and CAD proteins but had no effect on that of Caspase-3. Taken together, these results suggested that expression of the BMP4 gene resulted in a reduction in Caspase-9 protein leading to inhibition of GC apoptosis via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in geese.

The Coeur d'Alene River Basin, Lake Coeur d'Alene, and the Spokane River contain elevated heavy metal concentrations in sediment and water from historical mining and ore processing operations in the Coeur d'Alene Basin. Lead poisoning has been identified as the cause of death in hundreds of waterfowl utilizing wetlands in the floodplain of the Coeur d'Alene River, but little was known about hazards to waterfowl from heavy metal contamination in shallow bays and wetlands of Lake Coeur d'Alene. We examined lake sediment and blood lead concentrations in waterfowl utilizing Lake Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, to evaluate potential lead contamination of waterfowl utilizing the lake. We collected 56 palustrine and 102 lacustrine sediment samples and 61 mallard and 8 wood duck blood samples. Mean lead concentrations from palustrine and lacustrine sediment samples ranged from 14 to 3508 mg/kg dry weight (dw) and from 19 to 5009 mg/kg (dw), respectively. Lead concentrations in palustrine and lacustrine sediment from several Lake Coeur d'Alene bays were higher than those in lake reference areas and were higher than Bunker Hill Superfund Site target cleanup levels and suggested site-specific toxicity thresholds for swans. Mean blood lead from mallard and wood ducks sampled from Lake Coeur d'Alene bays were within lead toxicity ranges for waterfowl associated with clinical and severe clinical lead poisoning. We also collected 19 Canada goose and 3 mallard fecal samples to evaluate exposure through sediment ingestion. Waterfowl using Lake Coeur d'Alene appear to be exposed to lead by ingesting contaminated lake sediment. Our model predicts a sediment lead effects range of 147-944 mg/kg (dw) and mortality effects level of 1652 mg/kg (dw) for mallards utilizing Lake Coeur d'Alene. The locations of Harrison Slough, Powderhorn Bay, and Cottonwood Bay at the mouth of the Coeur d'Alene River and Blackwell Island and Cougar Bay near the Spokane River outflow of Lake Coeur d'Alene were the areas of greatest concern for waterfowl exposure to lead contaminated sediment.

In the experiments the method of intensive feeding of geese (hybrid Ivages with steamed maize for a period of 32 days at two different altitudes was used (146 m above sea level and 974 m above sea level). Changes of the ultrastructure of the heart muscle of these animals were investigated. At both levels a marked lipid infiltration of myocardial cells was observed, formation of a large number of myelin-like structures, contractures of myofibril bundles, enhanced lobe formation of nuclei and marked abundance of pinocytic vacuoles in endothelials of capillaries. In geese from the high altitude the extent of fatty infiltration, the number of myelin-like structures and contractures of myofibril bundles was smaller than at the lower altitude. Probably during the more than one-month stay of the geese at the higher altitude as part of adaptation processes a population of "young" smaller mitochondria developed which represented a 10% increment of mitochondria which was confirmed also by morphometric methods.

Egg laying in Magang geese is characterized by extended interruption between clutches and lowing laying rate. Both the ovarian follicular development and ovulation characteristics, and the associated endocrine and molecular regulatory mechanisms involved are poorly understood, but could be important for guiding development of molecule aided selection of egg laying performances in geese. This study, therefore, recorded egg-laying characteristics of Magang geese, and the endocrine and molecular regulatory mechanisms of ovarian follicular development, maturation, and ovulation in Magang geese.

Dysregulation of adipogenesis causes metabolic diseases, like obesity and fatty liver. Migratory birds such as geese have a high tolerance of massive energy intake and exhibit little pathological development. Domesticated goose breeds, derivatives of the wild greyleg goose (Anser anser) or swan goose (Anser cygnoides), have high tolerance of energy intake resembling their ancestor species. Thus, goose is potentially a model species to study mechanisms associated with adipogenesis.

A method has been developed for increasing the survival of wildfowl lymphocytes during transport over considerable distances. Blood in an equal volume of heparinised RPMI was maintained at close to avian body temperature, i.e., approximately 40 degrees C. Using this system lymphocyte transformation in the presence of antigen (mycobacterial) has been successfully performed with wildfowl mononuclear cells for the first time. Duck cells were cultured in 10% autologous sera with 8 x 10(5) cells/well for 4 days. Cells from Hawaiian geese (Branta sandvicensis) required similar culture conditions but were incubated for 3 days.

The role of electrostatic interactions in the attachment and fusion at acidic pH of Sindbis virus (SNV) with goose erythrocytes was studied, investigating the effect of several anionic and cationic polyelectrolytes on SNV hemagglutination and hemolysis. In order to establish the target of active drugs, the compounds were incubated either with the virus particles or with the erythrocytes. Dextran sulfate was the only compound able to inhibit the attachment of SNV to the erythrocytes. Fusion of virus with red cells was reduced dose-dependently by the polyanions dextran sulfate, mucin and polygalacturonic acid. On the contrary two polycations, polylysine and polybrene, enhanced viral hemolytic activity. However the effect of polyions is not exclusively related to the electric charge since ineffective molecules were found in both classes of compounds.

The relationship between immunological distance (I.D.) measured by microcomplement fixation and amino acid sequence difference for lysine-rich histones was tested using antisera to lysine-rich histones of known sequence, chicken H1 and H5, goose H5, and trout H1 as well as to trout H5. The best relationship between I.D. (y) and percent sequence difference (x) for lysine-rich histones, y = 2x, applies as well to other histones of known sequence but it differs from y = 5x, reported for other proteins and often used for histones. Although deviations indicate that I.D. is a poor predictor of primary sequence differences among histones, it suggests that trout H5 is more closely related to H1 than to chicken H5.

The goose is an economically important poultry species and a principal natural host of avian viruses. This study aimed to determine the effects of selenium on the immune response of geese. Under selenium stimulation, gene expression profiling was investigated using transcriptome sequencing. The selenoproteins were promoted by selenium stimulation, while the heat shock proteins, interleukin and interferons were mainly down-regulated. After comparison, 2228 differentially expressed genes were primarily involved in immune and environmental response, and infectious disease and genetic information processing related pathways were identified. Specifically, the enzymes of the lysosomes which acted as a safeguard in preventing pathogens were mostly up-regulated and six randomly selected differentially expressed genes were validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In addition, the most proportional increased transcription factor family basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) located in the 5' flank of selenoprotein P-like protein for selenium metabolism was identified by response to the selenium stimulation in this study. These analyses show that selenium can promote immune function by activating selenoproteins, transcript factors and lysosome pathway related genes, while weakening cytokine content genes in geese.

An avian paramyxovirus (APMV) isolated from goose feces (APMV/Shimane67) was biologically, serologically and genetically characterized. APMV/Shimane67 showed typical paramyxovirus morphology on electron microscopy. On hemagglutination inhibition test, antiserum against APMV/Shimane67 revealed low reactivity with other APMV serotypes and vice versa. The fusion (F) protein gene of APMV/Shimane67 contained 1,638 nucleotides in a single open reading frame encoding a protein of 545 amino acids. The cleavage site of F protein contained a pair of single basic amino acid (VRENR/L). The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the F gene of APMV/Shimane67 had relatively low identities (42.9-62.7% and 28.9-67.3%, respectively) with those of other APMVs. Phylogenetic analysis showed that APMV/Shimane67 was related to NDV, APMV-9 and APMV-12, but was distinct from those APMV serotypes. These results suggest that APMV/Shimane67 is a new APMV serotype, APMV-13.

Recombinant expression plasmid of pET-28a (+)-goIL-2 was constructed by inserting the goose IL-2 gene without the signal peptide sequence into the prokaryotic expression vector pET-28a (+), and transformed into the bacterial competent E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells for expression. After IPTG induction, an expected protein band with molecular weight of 15.0 kD was observed on SDS-PAGE gel, recognized by monoclonal antibody against goose IL-2 in western-blotting assay. In the pET-28a (+) expression system, much of the recombinant goose IL-2 (rgoIL-2) was found in inclusion bodies with a portion of soluble protein. The monomer and multimers of soluble goose interleukin 2 proteins were observed in native electrophoresis. The rgoIL-2 proteins were purified by Ni-NTA column under a native condition. The rgoIL-2 soluble protein monomer was isolated by a quick protein isolation and purification system of AKTA FPLC and identified by native PAGE. Bioactivity analysis showed that the rgoIL-2 monomer stimulated the proliferation of goose lymphocytes in vitro. This will establish a basis for further study about the biological function and clinical application of goose IL-2.

Information derived from questionnaires sent to producers of free-range eggs, chickens, turkeys and geese was used to assess the extent of fox predation in terms of the density of the fox population and farm management factors. The mean reported bird mortality was less than 2 per cent for all the producers, but there were marked differences between them. Egg producers reported losing many more birds to foxes than other types of producer (up to 1000 birds in a laying cycle). On average, egg and goose producers lost the highest proportions of their total flocks (0.5 per cent). The extent of predation was not associated either with large-scale estimations of the density of the fox population or with variations in the farms' habitat. Chicken predation was not linked to differences in types of housing or fencing. However, there was a positive association between losses due to other causes and chicken predation. The results suggest that changes in farm management would be the most cost-effective means of reducing fox predation, rather than greater fox control.

Lednice (Yaba 1) virus was found to multiply in primary cultures of goose, duck and chick embryo cells. The size of inoculum and age of embryos used for preparation of primary cultures was decisive for the amount of multiplied virus. One strain (110) of Lednice virus showed reduced ability to induce a cytopathic effect in the first passage in chick embryo cells. Virus multiplication in all three kinds of cells was confirmed by immunofluorescence.

The complete genome of goose picornavirus 1 (GPV-1) strain goose/NLSZK2/HUN/2013 (MF358731) was determined by RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing from a cloacal sample of a migratory waterfowl, greater white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons) in Hungary. The genome of GPV-1 shows an L-3-3-4 organization pattern with a 5'-terminal origin of replication (ORI) region, a type-IV IRES, and an Hbox/NC-type 2A protein. This virus showed the highest overall sequence identity to the members of the genus Kobuvirus, although the phylogenetic position of GPV-1 is different in the analyzed P1, 2C and 3CD phylogenetic trees, which further increases the diversity of known avian picornaviruses.

Elucidating the spatial dynamic and core gut microbiome related to wild bar-headed goose is of crucial importance for probiotics development that may meet the demands of bar-headed goose artificial breeding industries and accelerate the domestication of this species. However, the core microbial communities in the wild bar-headed geese remain totally unknown. Here, for the first time, we present a comprehensive survey of bar-headed geese gut microbial communities by Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology using nine individuals from three distinct wintering locations in Tibet. A total of 236,676 sequences were analyzed, and 607 OTUs were identified. We show that the gut microbial communities of bar-headed geese have representatives of 14 phyla and are dominated by Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. The additive abundance of these four most dominant phyla was above 96% across all the samples. At the genus level, the sequences represented 150 genera. A set of 19 genera were present in all samples and considered as core gut microbiome. The top seven most abundant core genera were distributed in that four dominant phyla. Among them, four genera (Lactococcus, Bacillus, Solibacillus, and Streptococcus) belonged to Firmicutes, while for other three phyla, each containing one genus, such as Proteobacteria (genus Pseudomonas), Actinobacteria (genus Arthrobacter), and Bacteroidetes (genus Bacteroides). This broad survey represents the most in-depth assessment, to date, of the gut microbes that associated with bar-headed geese. These data create a baseline for future bar-headed goose microbiology research, and make an original contribution to probiotics development for bar-headed goose artificial breeding industries.

Density regulation of the population growth rate occurs through negative feedbacks on underlying vital rates, in response to increasing population size. Here, we examine in a capital breeder how vital rates of different life-history stages, their elasticities and population growth rates are affected by changes in population size. We developed an integrated population model for a local population of Svalbard barnacle geese, Branta leucopsis, using counts, reproductive data and individual-based mark-recapture data (1990-2017) to model age class-specific survival, reproduction and number of individuals. Based on these estimates, we quantified the changes in demographic structure and the effect of population size on age class-specific vital rates and elasticities, as well as the population growth rate. Local density regulation at the breeding grounds acted to reduce population growth through negative effects on reproduction; however, population size could not explain substantial variation in survival rates, although there was some support for density-dependent first-year survival. With the use of prospective perturbation analysis of the density-dependent projection matrix, we show that the elasticities to different vital rates changed as population size increased. As population size approached carrying capacity, the influence of reproductive rates and early-life survival on the population growth rate was reduced, whereas the influence of adult survival increased. A retrospective perturbation analysis revealed that density dependence resulted in a positive contribution of reproductive rates, and a negative contribution of the numbers of individuals in the adult age class, to the realised population growth rate. The patterns of density dependence in this population of barnacle geese were different from those recorded in income breeding birds, where density regulation mainly occurs through an effect on early-life survival. This indicates that the population dynamics of capital breeders, such as the barnacle goose, are likely to be more reproduction-driven than is the case for income breeders.

Eggs (307) were collected in 1971 from twenty species of birds with a variety of feeding habits from the Niagara Peninsula. This area of ontario is intensively developed for agriculture and heavy industry and has a large urban population. Representative species were obtained from both the terrestrial and aquatic food chains. Eggs were analyzed for organochlorine insecticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, and total mercury. Eggs from carnivorous species at the top of the aquatic food chain had the highest mean residues of signa DDT(7.6to 22.4 pm), PCB (3.5 to 74.0 ppm) and total mercury (0.64 to 0.83 ppm). Eggs from some terrestrial carnivores (red-tailed hawk and great horned owl) also had relatively high residues (2.5 to 3.9 ppm of sigmaDDT, 0.2 to 1.0 ppm of PCB, 0.06 to 0.09 ppm of mercury, however levels were much lower than those found in eggs from aquatic-feeding carnivores. Eggs from one red-shouldered hawk had residues comparable to the aquatic feeding carnivores. Eggs from herbivorous and insectivorous birds of both aquatic and terrestrial environments contained much lower residues. PCB residues were slightly lower in eggs among the terrestrial feeding species (0.05 to 2.0 ppm) than among the aquatic feeders (0.14 to4.0 ppm) and tended to be lower in eggs from terrestrial species collected in rural than incity environs. Levels of sigmaDDT were similar in both groups with eggs from terrestrial feeders containing mean resisues between 0.15 and 2.64 ppm and those from aquatic feeders between 0.33 and 2.79 ppm.

Xupu goose is one of the famous native breed in China. In this work we reported the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of the Xupu goose in Hunan Province for the first time. The total length of the mitogenome is 16,742 bp, with the base composition of 30.21% for A, 22.70% for T, 32.02% for C, 15.08% for G, in the order C > A > T > G feature occurring in the Xupu goose. And it is made up of two ribosomal RNA genes, 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes and a non-coding control region (D-loop region). The characteristics of the mitochondrial genome were analyzed and discussed in detail. The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of Xupu goose will be useful for the phylogenetics of poultry, and be available as basic data for the genetics and breeding.

Experiments were carried out with a total of 144 geese of the Benkovska breed divided into 6 groups of 24 birds each. The average weight was 3.5 kg, the birds being compulsory fattened with steamed maize over an average period of 27 days. Flavophospholipol (flavofarm-NIHFI) was given at rates of 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16 ppm. The method of positive control check was employed--a group which was offered zinc-bacitracin--(bacifarmin) at 30 ppm. Under the effect of flavophospholipol the weight gain was 2.2 to 21.2 per cent higher, and the weight of the liver rose by 1.4-23.1 per cent. The intake of maize per kg of gain dropped by 2.5 to 15.7 per cent, and it was 1.8 to 16.9 per cent lower per kg of liver. When flavophospholipol was given at 16 ppm, a maximum effect was produced--21.0 percent higher gain, 23.1 per cent increase of the liver weight, 15.7 per cent drop of maize intake per kg of gain, and 16.9 per cent drop of maize intake per kg of liver. With geese that were offered bacifarmin these indices were 3.3, 11.9,, 4.8, and 10.7 per cent, respectively. The amount of flavophospholipol used correlated positively with its ergotropic effect. The liver quality with geese treated with flavophospholipol and bacifarmin was higher. No residual amounts of flavophospholipol were found in the meat, liver and viscera of the treated birds.

Arctic amplification, the accelerated climate warming in the polar regions, is causing a more rapid advancement of the onset of spring in the Arctic than in temperate regions. Consequently, the arrival of many migratory birds in the Arctic is thought to become increasingly mismatched with the onset of local spring, consequently reducing individual fitness and potentially even population levels. We used a dynamic state variable model to study whether Arctic long-distance migrants can advance their migratory schedules under climate warming scenarios which include Arctic amplification, and whether such an advancement is constrained by fuel accumulation or the ability to anticipate climatic changes. Our model predicts that barnacle geese Branta leucopsis suffer from considerably reduced reproductive success with increasing Arctic amplification through mistimed arrival, when they cannot anticipate a more rapid progress of Arctic spring from their wintering grounds. When geese are able to anticipate a more rapid progress of Arctic spring, they are predicted to advance their spring arrival under Arctic amplification up to 44 days without any reproductive costs in terms of optimal condition or timing of breeding. Negative effects of mistimed arrival on reproduction are predicted to be somewhat mitigated by increasing summer length under warming in the Arctic, as late arriving geese can still breed successfully. We conclude that adaptation to Arctic amplification may rather be constrained by the (un)predictability of changes in the Arctic spring than by the time available for fuel accumulation. Social migrants like geese tend to have a high behavioural plasticity regarding stopover site choice and migration schedule, giving them the potential to adapt to future climate changes on their flyway.

A history is given of the Seney National Wildlife Refuge and the losses of goslings of Canada geese (Branta canadensis) recorded since inception of the refuge in 1935. Since 1960, when more reliable data became available, losses have been estensive every 4 years. Goslings deaths are attributed to the infection with Leucocytozoon simondi. The blackfly (Simulium innocens) is considered to be the prime vector in the transmission of this blood parasite to goslings.

In this study we have characterized four of the principle goose apolipoproteins and compared their physicochemical properties with human and avian counterparts. Goose ApoB-100 and ApoAI amino acid compositions were very similar to their chicken and human homologous proteins. The partial N-terminal sequence from goose ApoAI was 91% and 82% similar to the corresponding duck and chicken proteins, respectively. Most of the observed amino acid changes detected between the ApoAI sequences were amino acid replacements having the same characteristics and could be the result of a single base mutation. The N-terminal portion of two ApoC-like apolipoproteins were also studied. Goose ApoCa had an electrophoretic mobility of 0.31 and exhibited a nine-residue motif that was well conserved between ApoCIII sequences from different species. We therefore suggest that ApoCa is the equivalent of mammalian ApoCIII. The N-terminal portion of goose ApoCb, the second major ApoC in high-density apolipoprotein, showed no similarity to proteins previously described in the literature. This protein displayed two isomorphs in alkaline urea gel electrophoresis called ApoCb1 and ApoCb2 with Rf values of 0.36 and 0.39, respectively. A genetic polymorphism was detected in the population whereby 25% of the animals carried only one isomorph and 50% exhibited both ApoCb isomorphs. These frequencies were similar in females and males. The transmission mode of these ApoCb isomorphs was consistent with two segregating alleles from a single codominantly expressed gene.

Physical activity is generally considered as most relevant for modulating heart rate (HR). The authors show here that HR is not only modulated by physical activity but even more by social contexts. HR modulation in three free-ranging, socially embedded, male greylag geese fitted with implanted radiotransmitters was investigated. Measured HR ranged from 40 beats per minute (bpm) during rest to a maximum over 400 bpm during takeoff. Almost the same maximum HRs (400 bpm) were reached during social interactions, which however, generally require less bodily action. Mean HR during social interactions (agonistic interactions, vocalizations) was significantly higher than during behaviors with a less obvious social context (e.g., resting, comfort or feeding behavior), but with comparable physical activity involved. The authors also found significant and consistent differences in HR between the three focal individuals, probably because of individual behavioral phenotype. Our results show that social context has a strong modulatory effect on the sympathico-adrenergic activity in a social bird and conclude that particularly the latter may pose considerable energetic costs.

The role of proteins in biomineralization and the mechanism of eggshell formation are not well understood. We have isolated and purified the major protein, ansocalcin from goose eggshell matrix. The amino acid sequence study indicates that ansocalcin is homologous to the chicken eggshell protein, ovocleidin 17, and C-type lectins. Ansocalcin nucleates polycrystalline aggregates of calcite crystals in in vitro mineralization experiments. The polycrystalline aggregates obtained at higher concentration of ansocalcin appears to be similar to the crystals observed at the mamillary layer of the eggshell.

The effect of dry-curing salt content (4% low salt (LS), 8% high salt (HS)) on lipolysis, lipid oxidation and volatile compounds in dry-cured goose was investigated in our study. The activities of acid lipase and neutral lipase increased during dry-curing, while phospholipase reached its maximum at the end of marinating. Lipoxygenase (LOX) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) values increased during dry-curing and marinating then decreased during dry-ripening. Total free fatty acids (TFFA) increased at dry-curing and dry-ripening points and decreased during marinating. Total peak area of lipids derived volatile compounds (TPALDVC) and total peak area increased during entire stages. Compared to LS, HS group has higher lipolytic and LOX activities, TBARS, TFFA, unsaturated fatty acids and TPALDVC. The higher TPALDVC in HS could be attributed to higher lipid hydrolysis and oxidation during processing.

Radial hemolysis-in-agarose gel (HIG) with members of the genera Alphavirus and Flavivirus is described. The test can be reproduced with goose and sheep erythrocytes sensitized at the optimal pH for each virus. Human (O group), rooster, guinea pig, mouse and hamster erythrocytes were found to be unsuitable. The titer of immune ascitic fluids in HIG coincides with the titer in hemagglutination inhibition. Investigation of convalescent sera after laboratory infection suggests the possiblity of HIG application for serologic diagnosis of arbovirus infection.

Lysozyme is an important defense molecule of the innate immune system. Known for its bactericidal properties, lysozyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of b-(1,4)-glycosidic bonds between the N-acetyl glucosamine and N-acetyl muramic acid in the peptidoglycan layer of bacterial cell walls. In this study, the complete coding sequence of four g-type lysozymes were identified in Ciona intestinalis. Phylogenetic analysis and modelling supported the hypothesis of a close relationship with the vertebrate g-type lysozymes suggesting that the C. intestinalis g-type lysozyme genes (CiLys-g1, Cilys-g2, CiLys-g3, CiLys-g4) share a common ancestor in the chordate lineage. Protein motif searches indicated that C. intestinalis g-type lysozymes contain a GEWL domain with a GXXQ signature, typical of goose lysozymes. Quantitative Real-Time PCR analysis results showed that transcripts are expressed in various tissues from C. intestinalis. In order to determine the involvement of C. intestinalis g-type lysozymes in immunity, their expression was analyzed in the pharynx, showing that transcripts were significantly up-regulated in response to a challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). These data support the view that CiLys g-type are molecules with potential for immune defense system against bacterial infection.

Biochemical mechanisms which may control fat deposition in liver and/or peripheral tissues have been studied in Poland and Landes geese. Post-prandial plasma substrates and post-heparin lipoprotein-lipase (LPL) activity were measured in 10-week-old animals. At 23 weeks of age, geese were overfed for 14 days then slaughtered. Hepatic steatosis was more important in Landes geese, while muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue were less developed. In this breed, fatty liver weight negatively scaled to LPL activity, suggesting that a low LPL activity is a limiting factor of peripheral fat deposition. Consequently, non-catabolized VLDL may return to liver and increase hepatic steatosis. In Poland geese, such a mechanism does not exist. On the other hand, fatty liver weight was positively correlated to very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and triacylglycerols measured in overfed Poland geese, suggesting that lipids synthetized by liver are better transferred from liver to extrahepatic tissues. Kinetics of post-prandial plasma glucose, triacylglycerols, phospholipids and uric acid were similar in the two breeds. However, the marked decrease in post-prandial plasma glycerol in Poland geese suggests that an extrahepatic tissue lipolysis inhibition could contribute to the higher peripheral fattening in overfed Poland geese and could be a limiting factor of hepatic steatosis in this breed.

The aim of the study was to find a practical and inexpensive method for freezing goose semen for use in routine inseminations under farm conditions. Two basic freezing protocols [(1) dynamic, programmable freezing and (2) static, nitrogen vapour method] were evaluated with varying concentrations of dimethylformamide (DMF) plus additional osmoprotectants such as betaine, trehalose, and sucrose, using cryovials as containers. Altogether eight different treatments were compared. sperm viability before freezing and after thawing was examined by in vitro tests and, in the case of the simplest effective method, also by in vivo fertility test. There were no significant differences in sperm survival either in the dynamic (48-50%) or in the static protocol (43-46%), except for the treatment where the lowest DMF concentration was used without any osmoprotectant in the dynamic protocol (42.6%). The addition of osmoprotectants did not improve thawed sperm viability in any case. Fertility with frozen/thawed sperm using the simplest method was 58.5%, while that obtained with fresh, diluted semen was 66.9%. The study proved that the simple freezing of gander semen in nitrogen vapour with 9% DMF in cryovials could produce acceptable fertility. The newly elaborated method can be successfully used for routine inseminations by small- and large-scale goose breeders.

Flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) plays a critical role in catalyzing the conversion of trimethylamine (TMA) to trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) in vivo. Despite the well-documented association between FMO3 mutations and a 'fishy' off-flavor eggs in chicken and quail, little information is available regarding the molecular characteristic of goose (Anser cygnoides) FMO3 and its relationship with the yolk TMA content. To fill these gaps, we cloned the full-length cDNA sequence of goose FMO3, which comprised 1851bp encoding 531 amino acids. FMO3 mRNA was dramatically expressed in liver than in other tissues in the geese. Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected in the entire coding region. The CC genotype at the T669C site, GG at the A723G site, and AA at the G734A site of FMO3 were highly significantly associated with elevated TMA content in goose egg yolk (P<0.001). Carriers of the A allele of G734A or C allele of T885C had yolk TMA content that had a high probability of being elevated after feeding with additional choline chloride (P=0.0429, OR=4.1300, 95%CI=1.0390-16.4270, and P=0.0251, OR=4.6060, 95%CI=1.1620-18.2620, respectively). This work lays a foundation for studying the function of FMO3 and yolk TMA content in goose. However, studies using larger sample sizes and more goose breeds are required to determine whether the fishy off-flavor trait exists in goose.

The complete F gene of SF02 of goose paramyxovirus (GPV) has been cloned and analyzed. The sequence analysis demonstrated that the F gene of SF02 contains 1 662 nt and encodes 553 amino acids, and its cleavage activation site of F gene has the same deduced amino acid sequence, (112)R-R-Q-K-R-F(117), as the velogenic (highly pathogenic) strain of newcastle disease virus. The latter correlated with the virulence of the isolate in biological assays. The F gene of SF02 isolate with the domestic standard velogenic strain NDV, F48E9, shared 86.5% homology in nucleotide and 90.8% homology in amino acid sequences. The SF02 isolate is closer to some NDV strains prevalent in Taiwan and West-European countries in recent years. Based on the F gene sequence a multiplex RT-PCR method has been developed. It could be used for the discrimination of GPV from NDV.

Because some fraudulent or unintentional mislabeling occurs that can be undetected, resulting in lower quality pâté, and because some population groups, for philosophical or religious reasons, do not wish to eat meat from certain species, a new procedure was developed and evaluated to detect pâté species composition by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). The RAPD method was used to generate fingerprint patterns for pork, chicken, duck, turkey, and goose meats. Ten DNA samples from pork, chicken, turkey, and duck meats were tested to confirm the effectiveness and specificity. Specific results for each species were obtained by the RAPD method. Sensitivity of the method was studied by DNA dilution in each species, detecting as little as 250 pg of DNA. Isolations of DNA from 30 pâtés (tinned and untinned) were carried out, and an optimal DNA was obtained for using as template DNA in polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The RAPD-PCR pattern was useful to identify species composition of pork, duck, duck-pork, goose, and poultry pâtés. This study demonstrates the usefulness of RAPD fingerprinting to distinguish between species in pâtés.

Peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) is considered an essential molecule for effective immunity in invertebrates by its detection and clarification of invading bacteria. Bivalve mollusks also possess PGRP systems for self-defense, however, their functions in bivalves remain to be understood. In the present study, cDNA of a novel PGRP was identified from the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, using EST-based RACE PCR. This novel PGRP is homologous to short PGRPs and the presence of a signal peptide was predicted. The PGRP is classified into the short PGRP group, although its molecular weight was estimated as 54 kDa, close to that of long PGRP groups. A conserved domain search detected amidase_2/PGRP and goose-type (g-type) lysozyme domains in this PGRP structure, and thus this novel PGRP was designated as CgPGRP-L. Catalytic residues for PGRP and g-type lysozyme are well conserved, suggesting that CgPGRP-L may have both binding and lytic functions against bacteria. Reverser transcription PCR (RT-PCR) detected CgPGRP-L mRNA expression in circulatory hemocytes, and quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed that its expression increased after Marinococcus halophilus and Vibrio tubiashii exposure. These results indicate that CgPGRP-L is expressed in hemocytes by bacterial invasion, and then may play roles of a short PGRP and bacterio-lytic lysozyme.

The H5N1 viruses (H5N1/97) associated with the "bird-flu" incident in the Hong Kong SAR have not been isolated since the slaughter of poultry in December 1997 brought that outbreak to an end. Recent evidence points to this virus as having arisen through a reassortment of a number of precursor avian viruses and a virus related to Goose/Guangdong/1/96 (H5N1) (Gs/Gd/96) was the likely donor of the H5 hemagglutinin. We characterize the Goose/Guangdong/1/96-like viruses isolated from geese and ducks imported into Hong Kong in the year 2000. Antigenically and genetically, these recent H5N1 viruses fall into two groups, one mainly associated with geese, and the other, recently transmitted to ducks. Further, viruses isolated from a goose and a duck in December 2000 have acquired NS, PA, M, and PB2 genes from the aquatic avian influenza gene pool through reassortment. For pandemic preparedness, it is important to monitor whether these reassortant viruses have the capacity for interspecies transmission to terrestrial poultry or mammals.

Plasma glucose, free fatty acid and uric acid levels were measured in lead-poisoned Canada geese (Branta canadensis). Although plasma glucose levels were only slightly elevated, uric acid was significantly higher and free fatty acids were significantly lower. Altered plasma levels were attributed to increased protein catabolism and perhaps renal disfunction. Plasma level of growth hormone and prolactin was assessed by radioimmunoassay. Growth hormone remained unchanged while prolactin was unusually high. The increased prolactin levels may reflect an effort to stabilize free fatty acids.

The objective of this work was to elucidate the gene expression profiles of luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin (PRL) and their receptors during the developmental and egg laying stage. The expression of genes encoding pituitary LH and PRL, as well as those for the ovarian LH receptor (LHR) and PRL receptor (PRLR), was determined by quantitative real-time PCR in Zi geese on day 1 and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 months of age, respectively. The expression of LH and LHR fluctuated and increased as the geese aged. The expression of LH was significantly higher at 5 to 8 months of age than in 1 day old geese (P < 0.05). The expression of LHR was higher at 8 months than at 1 day, at 1 to 4 months and at 6 months (P < 0.05). The expression of PRL decreased from day 1, followed by an increase from 3 months, and reached the highest values at 8 months of age in the study. The difference in PRL expression between 7 and 8 months of age was significant (P < 0.05). The expression of PRLR decreased initially and this was followed by a fluctuating increase from 5 months until 8 months of age. The expression of PRLR in 1 to 8 month old geese was significantly lower than at day 1 (P < 0.05). These results suggest that LH and PRLR may play an important role in ovarian development and the egg-laying process in Zi geese.

We evaluated the effects of betaine supplementation on liver weight, liver/body weight, serum parameters and morphological changes. Compared with the control and overfed groups, the geese that were fed the betaine diet showed increased liver weight and decreased abdominal adipose tissue weight compared with the overfeeding groups. Betaine treatment also significantly increased ChE, HDL, LDH and ALT levels (P<0.01 or P<0.05). Decreased macrovesicular steatosis and increased microvesicular steatosis were observed in the betaine-treated group, and the lipid was well-distributed in the betaine supplement group. The expression of S14alpha mRNA in the livers of the betaine-treated geese was higher than that in the control or the overfed geese. We performed sodium bisulfite sequencing of the individual alleles of this region (between +374 and -8 base pairs relative to the transcription start site), containing 33 CpG dinucleotides. In the overfed group expressing higher S14alpha transcripts, the average methylation at the 33 CpGs sites was 87.9%. This contrasted with 69.6% in the control group that showed lower expression of the S14alpha gene (P<0.01). However, no significant change in methylation in the transcription start site was found between the betaine-treated geese (82.6%) and the overfed geese (87.9%). These results indicate that the DNA methylation pattern in the S14alpha gene transcription start site may not be related to the expression of S14alpha transcript in response to betaine supplementation.

In 1935, the graylag goose Martina (1935-?) hatched from an egg in the home of the zoologist Konrad Lorenz (1903-1989). Martina imprinted on Lorenz, slept in his bedroom, mated with the gander Martin, and flew off in 1937. Over the following decades, Konrad Lorenz helped to establish the discipline of ethology, received a share of the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, and continued to write about his famous goose Martina. This essay examines the different instantiations of the geese in general, and Martina in particular, in Lorenz's writings aimed at readerships that included prewar zoologists, National Socialist psychologists, and popular audiences from the 1930s to 1980s. By developing an animal with her own biography, Lorenz created an individual whose lived and rhetorical agency made her especially well suited to perform widely divergent aspects of his evolving science. While a significant literature in the history of science has explored the standardization and stabilization of animals in science, I show how Lorenz's creation of a highly protean and increasingly public Martina was co-constitutive of the establishment of the science and public persona.

A new genus, Anserobilharzia, is proposed to accommodate Anserobilharzia brantae n. comb. (syn. Trichobilharzia bran- tae Farr & Blankemeyer, 1956), a species of avian schistosome thus far found exclusively in anserini geese (Anser, Branta, Chen) from Europe and North America, and Gyraulus snails. Recent collections and subsequent molecular analyses showed that A. brantae was distinct from Allobilharzia and Trichobilharzia and grouped basal to Trichobilharzia. Using nuclear 28S, ITS and mitochondrial cox1 as genetic yardsticks, samples of A. brantae from North America and Europe were each other's closest relative and distinct from Allobilharzia and Trichobilharzia. Anserobilharzia brantae was also distinct when compared morphologically with other species of closely related avian schistosomes. The following descrip- tion is based on males, females, eggs, and cercariae. The new genus is characterized by a) ovoid egg (72-145µm x 44- 89 µm) with spine, b) male with > 500 testes and caecal reunion anteriad to seminal vesicle, c) cercariae with 5+1 flame cells, and d) intermediate hosts are planorbid snails. The only confirmed species of snail host is Gyraulus parvus in North America. Based on presented data, we propose a new genus and new combination for A. brantae justified by morpholog- ical, host use, and molecular characteristics.

On the occasion of slaughter, 97 laying chickens, 100 broilers, 48 geese and 36 ducks were examined for Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. in liver, small intestine and caeca. Pathological changes in the liver were recorded. Campylobacters and salmonellas were isolated from 61 and 18% of the laying chickens, 63 and 3% of the broilers, 54 and 15% of the geese and from 81 and 39% of the ducks, respectively. Birds with diseased liver were found more often infected with campylobacters and salmonellas than those without. This correlation could be gathered from the isolation rates from the liver and from the intestine. The occurrence of campylobacters and salmonellas together in the liver was only observed in individuals with pathological changes of the liver. The own findings suggest that besides salmonellas also campylobacters can be responsible for diseases of the liver.

Sera collected from several migratory birds of the Danube Delta, from humans and domestic birds and animals of three Romanian counties were tested by hemagglutination-inhibition reaction for the presence of antibodies to Yaba 1--Lednice 110 virus. Antibodies could be detected in only 8 of the 14 species of migratory birds included in the study, especially in wild geese and ducks.

Nicarbazin is being investigated as an infertility agent for the control of non-migratory Canada geese (Branta canadensis L) populations. Nicarbazin is presently registered for use as a coccidiostat for poultry. Geese fed sufficient quantities of nicarbazin will lay non-viable eggs. We established nicarbazin consumption by measuring the concentration of a component of the formulation, 4,4'-dinitrocarbanilide (DNC) in the egg contents (yolk, albumin) in non-viable eggs. To estimate the nicarbazin consumption of birds that laid viable eggs (eggs that hatched or contained an embryo), a high-performance liquid chromatography method was developed to measure the concentration of DNC in egg shells. A statistically significant correlation was established using linear regression between the mean concentrations of DNC in the egg shell and in the egg contents in non-viable eggs. Viable eggs were estimated to contain lower levels of DNC than non-viable eggs. DNC concentrations in both the egg contents and the egg shell increased with increases in nicarbazin dose in feed. Our method allows for the estimation of nicarbazin consumption and DNC dose in eggs under field conditions, which is important in developing an effective infertility agent for over-abundant non-migratory goose populations.

Two strains (pedersoliT and girotti) of a new species of bacteria were isolated from the preen glands of wild Egyptian geese (Alopochen aegyptiacus) from the river Neckar in southern Germany in two subsequent years. The strains were lipophilic, fastidious, Gram-positive rods and belonged to the genus Corynebacterium. Phylogenetically, the isolates were most closely related to Corynebacterium falsenii DSM 44353T which has been found to be associated with birds before. 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to all known Corynebacterium spp. was significantly <97%. Corresponding values of rpoB showed low levels of similarity <87% and ANIb was <73%. G+C content of the genomic DNA was 65.0mol% for the type strain of the goose isolates, as opposed to 63.2mol% in Corynebacterium falsenii. MALDI-TOF MS analysis of the whole-cell proteins revealed patterns clearly different from the related species, as did biochemical tests, and polar lipid profiles. We therefore conclude that the avian isolates constitute strains of a new species, for which the name Corynebacterium heidelbergense sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is pedersoliT (=DSM 104638T=LMG 30044T).

It is generally acknowledged that seasonal fluctuations in the morphology and function of bird testes are primarily regulated by seasonal changes in circulating concentrations of testosterone (T) which mediates its action via the androgen receptor (AR). However, it has not yet been elucidated whether gonadal sensitivity to androgens also varies across the bird reproductive cycle. In order to answer the above question, this study makes the first ever attempt to account for the gonadal expression of the AR gene and protein in relation to circulating and testicular T concentrations in the gonads of male birds during the reproductive cycle. The experimental model used in this study was the domestic goose, Anser anser f. domestica, a species with three distinct phases of the annual reproductive cycle: the breeding season in March, the non-breeding season in July and the sexual reactivation phase in November. The plasma and testicular T concentrations were highest in the breeding season, followed by a dramatic decline in the non-breeding season with a successive rise in the sexual reactivation phase. Interestingly, we observed the divergent effect of season on AR mRNA and protein expression. Whereas the AR gene expression showed a nearly inverse relationship with T levels, the seasonal variations in AR protein levels primarily reflected the differences in T concentrations. The results of our study also indicated that regardless of the examined phase of the season, an abundance of AR protein was found only in the nuclei of Leydig and Sertoli cells and myoid cells. The above supports the observation that somatic cells are the targets for androgen action in bird testes. Summarizing, this study revealed that seasonal variations in sensitivity to androgens in the gonads of male birds are reflected in variations in the availability of their cognate receptors. Furthermore, a different pattern of seasonal expression of the AR gene and protein suggests that the AR system is subject to complex regulation that includes both steroid-dependent and steroid-independent factors.

The identification of the differential expression of genes in the ovaries of egg-laying and prelaying Zi geese is required to improve the laying performance of the geese. In the present study, suppression subtractive hybridization and reverse dot-blot were employed to identify such genes, using the ovary as a model. Furthermore, expression profiling of estrogen receptor 1, estrogen receptor 2, follicle stimulating hormone receptor, prolactin receptor, ferritin H chain, and ovary differentially expressed unknown gene 08 in ovaries from geese was performed by quantitative real-time PCR. Total RNA from the ovaries of laying and prelaying Zi geese was pooled and the mRNA was isolated. The cDNA that was reverse-transcribed from the ovarian mRNA of the prelaying geese was subtracted from the cDNA isolated from the laying geese. Four hundred sixty-five clones containing putative differentially expressed gene fragments were further identified by reverse dot-blot. Ninety-seven clones were subjected to sequencing and further analysis. Sequence analysis showed that the expression of 18 known (including a mitochondrial gene) and 8 unknown gene fragments was higher in the ovaries of laying geese compared with prelaying geese. Seventeen of the known genes encode proteins that belong to groups involved with binding, catalytic activity, enzyme regulatory activity, signal transducer activity, structural molecule, and transporter activity. The results of the quantitative real-time PCR showed that the expression of estrogen receptor 1, estrogen receptor 2, follicle stimulating hormone receptor, prolactin receptor, ferritin H chain, and ovary differentially expressed unknown gene 08 was higher in the ovaries of the laying geese than in those of the prelaying geese (P<0.05). These differentially expressed genes may be relevant to the progression of prelaying geese to the egg-laying stage. Further study is required to elucidate the molecular mechanism that controls egg-laying in geese, to improve the productivity of laying geese.

This study reports the findings of a high-resolution melting (HRM) curve analysis combined with PCR technique (PCR-HRM) to differentiate between Muscovy duck parvovirus (MDPV) and goose parvovirus (GPV). A degenerate primer set was designed based on the VP3 gene of MDPV and GPV. The PCR HRM assay was able to discriminate between MDPVs and GPVs by differences in melting curve shapes and melting temperatures. A total of forty-five clinical samples, passaged in the allantoic cavity of Muscovy duck eggs, were detected by the PCR-HRM assay. Among the 12 positive samples, two were identified as MDPV and two as GPV with high genotype confidence percentage (GCP) values. Seven positive samples had low GCP values for the melting curve analysis and were identified as co-infection samples. One of the 12 positive samples, designed GDNX strain, was identified as a variant strain with a divergent melting curve profile. To assess the capability of PCR-HRM assay to distinguish MDPV and GPV, fifty-two field samples were collected and examined. Seven samples were positive for MDPV and/or GPV. Thus, this developed assay was useful for discrimination of MDPVs and GPVs and can also be suitable for detecting co-infection samples.

Arctic-breeding geese acquire resources for egg production from overwintering grounds, spring stopover sites and breeding grounds, where pollutant exposure may differ. We investigated the effect of migration strategy on pollutant occurrence of lipophilic polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and protein-associated poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and mercury (Hg) in eggs of herbivorous barnacle geese ( Branta leucopsis) from an island colony on Svalbard. Stable isotopes (δ13C and δ15N) in eggs and vegetation collected along the migration route were similar. Pollutant concentrations in eggs were low, reflecting their terrestrial diet (∑PCB = 1.23 ± 0.80 ng/g ww; ∑PFAS = 1.21 ± 2.97 ng/g ww; Hg = 20.17 ± 7.52 ng/g dw). PCB concentrations in eggs increased with later hatch date, independent of lipid content which also increased over time. Some females may remobilize and transfer more PCBs to their eggs, by delaying migration several weeks, relying on more polluted and stored resources, or being in poor body condition when arriving at the breeding grounds. PFAS and Hg occurrence in eggs did not change throughout the breeding season, suggesting migration has a greater effect on lipophilic pollutants. Pollutant exposure during offspring production in arctic-breeding migrants may result in different profiles, with effects becoming more apparent with increasing trophic levels.

The amino terminal acid sequences of several mouse leukemia virus phosphoproteins (p12) show definite homology with the amino terminal conserved region of H5 histones, the phosphorylated nuclear proteins of nucleated erythrocytes. Differences in the amino acid compositions of the two groups of proteins seem to rule out the possibility that they evolved from a single common ancestral gene. The finding of sequence homology between viral p12's and cellular histones, however, is consistent with evolution of retrovirus structural proteins by a process of differentiation from preexisting cellular genes. The conserved primary and secondary structure at the amino terminal region, common to both groups of proteins, may be related to their common function of nucleic acid binding modulated by phosphorylation.

The pars distalis of geese and ducks was investigated by light and electron microscopical methods to identify certain peculiarities of the stellate cells. Stellate cells were found in both cephalic and caudal lobes of the pars distalis in both sexes of geese and ducks. These cells were small in size and stained blue to violet by Performic-Acid, Alcian- blue (pH 0.2), PAS, Orange G stain. The stellate cells have numerous fine and long cytoplasmic processes which are linked together and with the pars distalis cells by cell junctions. Some of the stellate cells were arranged into folliclelike structure entirely surrounding an extra-cellular heterogenous substance. Particular emphasis was given to the ultrastructure peculiarities of the stellate cells which may be considered to exhibit secretory as well as phagocytic activities.

An oesophageal impaction, consisting of plant material and nylon fishing line, and alimentary parasitism were diagnosed and treated in a Canada goose. At presentation the bird was non-ambulatory with flaccid neck muscles, lethargic, emaciated, dehydrated and had watery brown to green faeces. Palpation of the neck revealed a solid tubular mass ventrally in the mid-cervical region with gritty material cranial to it. Radiographs disclosed an oesophageal mass containing seed or grit-like radio-opaque material, and dilated cranial oesophagus containing radio-opaque material. Laboratory investigations revealed non-regenerative anaemia, heterophilia, lymphopenia, hypoproteinaemia, and many strongyle eggs in faeces. Treatment included supportive therapy, oesophageal gavage, oesophagotomy and drug therapy. The bird recovered and was released 27 days after initial presentation.

Four strains of Newcastle disease virus(NDV), which have proven to be responsible for the disease outbreaks in south and east China regions called "geese paramyxovirus infection" or "avian paramyxovirus infection of geese", were examined for the features of their fusion(F) protein genes. A 1700 nucleotides(nt) fragment of the F gene (1705 nt) of each of the 4 strains were sequenced, the results revealed that the NDV strains of goose origin share common transcriptional sequence and translational start position with the hitherto reported NDV, the F gene homologies among the 4 strains were 97.8%-98.9%, while the corresponding homologies between these strains and the standard challenge strain F48E8 were only 86.0-86.8%. The deduced amino acid sequences near cleavage site of F0 proteins showed a 112RRQKR/F117 motif, comforming well with that of the virulent strains. The cleavage sites distribution of 3 restriction enzymes(Hinf I, Basto I, Rsa I) in 75% region of the F gene(between 334-1682 nt), which is used to group NDV strains into different genotypes, were also analysed with the aid of computer program MegAlign, it is very interesting to find that the 4 strains showed a distinct distribution pattern from all the genotypes so far reported(genotype I-VIII), characterized by the simultaneously presence of a Bsto I site at 752 nt and two Rsa I sites at 872 nt and 973 nt. Additionally, 3 out of the 4 strains, despite their different geographical locations, showed a novel Rsa I site at position 1249 which is absent in all of the other genotypes. The 4 NDV strains of goose origin were essentially virulent ones, and probably belong to a new genotype.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between evolutionary theory and ethology in the work of Konrad Lorenz, Niko Tinbergen and V.C. Wynne-Edwards, the farmer, hunter, and census taker of the title respectively. I am especially interested in the idea of the ethologists Lorenz and Tinbergen that animal behavior and human behavior were equally appropriated subjects of biological analysis. Their approach is contrasted with Wynne-Edwards's group selective account of the evolution of social behavior. Finally, I argue that Wynne-Edwards's dogged commitment to group selection theory helped create the theoretical space within which subsequent researchers could develop more careful analyses.

Geese were domesticated over 6,000 years ago, making them one of the first domesticated poultry. Geese are capable of rapid growth, disease resistance, and high liver lipid storage capacity, and can be easily fed coarse fodder. Here, we sequence and analyze the whole-genome sequence of an economically important goose breed in China and compare it with that of terrestrial bird species.

The primary structures of the hemoglobin components Hb A and Hb D of the adult Andean Goose (Chloephaga melanoptera) are presented. The globin chains were separated on CM-Cellulose in 8M urea buffer. The amino-acid sequences were established by automatic Edman degradation of the globin chains and of the tryptic peptides in liquid- and gas-phase sequenators. The sequences are aligned with those of Greylag Goose (Anser anser) as a biological reference and other sequences of birds. A detailed evaluation of all residues of Andean Goose hemoglobins on the basis of the 12000 known avian globin sequences leads to a molecular pattern for high-altitude respiration of geese. The replacement of functional and structural importance is the unique occurrence of the residue beta 55 Leu----Ser (all other exchanges are functionally neutral), interrupting the same alpha 1 beta 1-interface contact (alpha 119-beta 55) that accounts for high-altitude respiration of the Barheaded Goose (Anser indicus); there the mutation is found on alpha A 119. Loosening the constraints of this interface must be interpreted as a destabilization of the low-affinity T-structure in favour of the high-affinity R-structure. The structural and functional significance of this interface for the molecular biology of high-altitude respiration of the Andean Goose and Barheaded Goose is discussed. Since Hb A consists of alpha A2 beta 2 and Hb D consists of alpha D2 beta 2 the mutation occurring in blood of the Andean Goose affects both hemoglobins whereas in the case of the Barheaded Goose only Hb A is affected. These results show that Hb D can be considered a biological reserve to enlarge situatively the normal hemoglobin function. A general molecular pattern for permanent (selective advantage of high intrinsic oxygen affinity) and transitory (selective advantage of graded oxygen affinities) adaptation to hypoxia is discussed. A survey on the sequence homology of the globin chains of geese (Anserinae) and ducks (Anatinae) is given.

Real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) based on SYBR-Green I binding is a quick, reliable, and easy method for analyzing small amounts of mRNA. Viral pathogens are recognized at the time of infection by pattern recognition receptors; thus, the inflammatory cytokines (IL1β, IL6, and IL18) and antiviral cytokines (IFNα, IFNγ) are secreted by innate immune cells and induced to respond to the pathogens. The objective of this study was to develop an effective and sensitive RT-qPCR assay for the rapid and accurate quantification of goose cytokines: IFNα, IFNγ, IL1β, IL6, and IL18. Subsequently, the established methods were employed to detect the immune response in agonist-stimulated goose spleen cells in vitro. These data indicated that the established RT-qPCR is a reliable method for determining relative gene expression. The results revealed that Imiquimod led to the significant upregulation of goose IFNα (P < 0.01), IFNγ (P < 0.01), IL1β (P < 0.01), IL6 (P < 0.01), and IL18 (P < 0.05). The established methods are important for scientific research and clinical applications, which require rapid and accurate results in a short period of time. The technique can potentially be used in the further research of goose molecular immunology, which will help us understand the interactions between hosts and pathogens.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of geese's maternal diet supplemented with flaxseed on the fatty acid profiles of egg yolks and the antioxidant status of their offspring. A total of 288 female Huoyan geese (42 weeks old) were randomly allotted to four experimental groups in this 56-day experiment and fed on diets containing flaxseed at 0% (control), 5%, 10% and 15%, respectively. There were nine replicate pens per treatment, with eight geese per replicate pen. The concentration of α-linolenic acid (linear, P<0.01), EPA (20:5n-3; linear, P<0.01), DHA (22:6n-3; quadratic, P=0.03) and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) (linear, P<0.01) levels in the yolk lipids increased with increasing dietary flaxseed levels. Yolk palmitic acid (16:0, linear, P=0.05), saturated fatty acid (linear, P=0.04) level and total n-6/n-3 ratio (P<0.01) decreased in a linear fashion as dietary flaxseed levels increased. Increasing dietary flaxseed levels linearly decreased (P=0.01) the total cholesterol in egg yolks. After hatching, three 1-day-old gosling were selected randomly from each replicate to determine blood characteristics and liver antioxidant status. Aspartate aminotransferase activity (linear, P=0.03), total triglycerides (linear, P=0.02) and total cholesterol (linear, P=0.05) contents in blood linearly decreased as the levels of flaxseed increased. A linear dose response to maternal dietary flaxseed was detected for the activities of the goslings' liver enzymes catalase (linear, P=0.01), superoxide dismutase (linear, P<0.01) and glutathione peroxidase (linear, P<0.01). The malondialdehyde (quadratic, P=0.03) and alkaline phosphatase content in the livers of goslings decreased as flaxseed supplementation levels increased. In conclusion, the dietary addition of flaxseed up to 15%, in the maternal diet resulted in increased n-3 PUFA levels in egg yolks and improved the antioxidant status of offspring in a dose-dependent manner.

On-farm biosecurity can be assessed by analyzing patterns of practices to better tailor technical advice to producers. Given their close contact with environmental and wildlife disease reservoirs, free-range duck farms are exposed to multiple risk factors of pathogen exposure that are rare or absent in indoor production. The recurrent emergence of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) viruses in Southeast Asia and Europe has emphasized the importance of farm-level biosecurity on free-range duck farms. This study was conducted on 46 French duck farms. The farms were visited and an 80-question survey was administered to assess biosecurity practices. Patterns of practices were explored with multiple correspondence analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis. Farms were assigned to one of three clusters in which specific farm types were overrepresented: farms specialized in rearing to grow-out phases and open-circuit full cycle (i.e., all production phases on the farm) farms in cluster 1, closed-circuit full cycle farms in cluster 2, and farms specialized in gavage in cluster 3. Differences in practices might be linked with differences in production constraints. This study provides a baseline assessment of biosecurity practices on foie gras duck farms in Southwest France and will help efforts to adapt biosecurity programs to farm types.

Wugangtong white goose is one of the famous native breed in Hunan province of China. In this study, the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of the Wugangtong white goose was reported in Hunan Province first, which was determined through PCR-based method. The total length of the mitogenome is 16,741 bp. It contains the typical structure, including 2 ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, 13 protein-coding genes and 1 non-coding control region (D-loop region) as that of most other vertebrates. The overall composition of the mitogenome was estimated to be 30.22% for A, 22.69% for T, 32.02% for C and 15.06% for G. All the protein initiation codons are ATG, except for COX1, COX2 and ND5 are GTG, ND6 is CTA. The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of the Wugangtong white goose will provide an important data set for the study in genetic mechanism of Wugangtong goose in Hunan province.

In order to obtain some information on how fatty liver arises in geese, we investigated the role of insulin and glucose in triglyceride (TG) accumulation in goose primary hepatocytes. Goose primary hepatocytes were isolated and treated with insulin and glucose. Compared with the control group, 100 and 150 nmol l(-1) insulin increased TG accumulation, acetyl-CoA carboxylase-alpha (ACCalpha) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) activity, and the mRNA levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), FAS and ACCalpha genes. Insulin at 200 nmol l(-1) had an inhibiting effect on TG accumulation and the activity of ACC and FAS, but increased the gene expression of SREBP-1, FAS and ACCalpha. We also found that high glucose (30 mmol l(-1)) increased the TG level, ACC and FAS activity, and the mRNA levels of SREBP-1 and FAS. However, there was no effect of high glucose on ACCalpha mRNA level. In addition, the interaction between insulin and glucose was observed to induce TG accumulation, ACC and FAS activity, and gene expression of SREBP-1, FAS and ACCalpha, and increase SREBP-1 nuclear protein level and binding of nuclear SREBP-1 and the SRE response element of the ACC gene. The result also indicated that the glucose-induced TG accumulation decreased after 96 h when the hepatocytes were cultured with 30 mmol l(-1) glucose. In conclusion, insulin and glucose may affect hepatic lipogenesis by regulating lipogenic gene expression and lipogenic enzyme activity in goose hepatocytes, and SREBP-1 might play an important role in the synergetic activation of lipogenic genes. We propose that the utilization of accumulated TG in hepatocytes is the reason for the reversible phenomenon in goose hepatocellular steatosis.

The concept of personality implies individual differences in behavior and physiology that show some degree of repeatability/consistency over time and across contexts. Most studies of animal personality, particularly studies of individuals' variation in physiological mechanisms, have been conducted on selected individuals in controlled conditions. We attempted to detect consistent behaviors as well as physiological patterns in greylag ganders (Anser anser) from a free-roaming flock living in semi-natural conditions. We tested 10 individuals repeatedly, in a handling trial, resembling tests for characterization of "temperaments" in captive animals. We recorded the behavior of the same 10 individuals during four situations in the socially intact flock: (1) a "low density feeding condition", (2) a "high density feeding condition", (3) a "low density post-feeding situation" and (4) while the geese rested. We collected fecal samples for determination of excreted immuno-reactive corticosterone (BM) and testosterone metabolites (TM) after handling trials, as well as the "low density feeding" and the "high density feeding" conditions. BM levels were very highly consistent over the repeats of handling trials, and the "low density feeding condition" and tended to be consistent over the first two repeats of the "high density feeding condition". Also, BM responses tended to be consistent across contexts. Despite seasonal variation, there tended to be inter-test consistency of TM, which pointed to some individual differences in TM as well. Aggressiveness turned out to be a highly repeatable trait, which was consistent across social situations, and tended to correlate with an individual's resistance during handling trials. Also, "proximity to the female partner" and "sociability" - the average number of neighboring geese in a close distance while resting - were consistent. We conclude that aggressiveness, "affiliative tendencies" and levels of excreted corticosterone and testosterone metabolites may be crucial factors of personality in geese.

This study identified Cryptosporidium genotypes in the Wissahickon watershed from May 2005 to April 2008. We analyzed 129 samples from Wissahickon Creek, 83 effluent samples from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and 240 fecal droppings. Genotyping was based on the hypervariable region of the 18S rRNA gene. Oocysts were detected year-round, independent of wet weather events, in 22% of Wissahickon Creek samples, 5% of WWTP effluents, and 7% of fecal samples. Of the genotypes detected, 67% were human-infectious: 30% C. hominis or C. hominis-like, 12% C. parvum, 14% cervine genotype, 9% skunk genotype, and 1% chipmunk I genotype. Similar genotype profiles were detected in Wissahickon Creek each year, and human-infectious genotypes were detected year-round. Unusual genotypes detected in a deer (a C. hominis-like genotype) and geese (C. hominis-like genotypes, C. parvum, and muskrat genotype I) show that these animals are vectors of human-infectious genotypes in this watershed. Results suggest that deer, geese, and WWTPs are appropriate targets for source water protection in the Wissahickon watershed.

Microbiologic studies were carried out on the meat and liver of fattened geese that were slaughtered with no sanitary restrictions. Established were the total counts of aerobically growing mesophiles as well as those of coliform, enterococcus, staphylococcus, and micrococcus organisms. The species composition of the isolated bacteria was also determined. It was shown that the investigated samples of the liver and of the pectoral and femoral muscles were free from Salmonella bacteria and pathogenic staphylococci, sulfite-reducing clostridia and Bacterium proteus.

Anatomy of lymphangions (valve segments) has been studied in 120 human and animal cadavers. Methods of investigation were: polychrome injection of arteries, veins and lymphatic bed; macro-microscopic preparation; staining of histopreparations after van Gieson, hematoxylin-eosin, complex technique after A.V. Borisov (1973); impregnation after V.V. Kuprianov (1965); detection of bundle collagene fibers after Mallory and elastic fibers after Weighert. The data collected on the lymphangions demonstrate that the valve segments (lymphangions) in the small intestinal wall appear in phylogenesis at first in birds. Avian lymphangions are cylindric and the valves are of semilunar form and the distance between them is 2--3 cm. In predators (dog, cat, fox, marten) lymphangions are round or conical. Their size is within 6--8 mm. In other animals (rodents, Artiodactyla, Perissodactyla) the lymphangions are 3--5 times longer comparing their width. In human ontogenesis the valve segments of the lymph vessels are formed in tela submucosa of the small intestine in 6--7-month-old fetuses. Some other peculiarities in animal and human anatomy of lymphangions have been revealed.

Based on literature data and own experiences the author gives an outlook about pathogenicity of avian mycoplasmas. In chickens and turkeys M. gallisepticum and M. synoviae (in addition to it M. meleagridis exclusively in turkeys) are the most important mycoplasmas producing respiratory disease, inflamation of synovial membranes and other lesions. Their pathogenic effect is very much influenced by dose of agent, route of entry of microorganism, age of birds, virulence and tropism of organism as well as associated other mycoplasma or virus or bacterial or fungal infections and conditions of environment. These facts rise difficulties in serological diagnostic and erradication program. Recently ureaplasma infection was also established in chickens and turkeys which can also be associated with respiratory disease. From ducks A. laidlawii, M. anatis and various unclassified strains were isolated, among these M. anatis and unclassified arginine splitting mycoplasma strains proved to be pathogenic. In geese M. gallinarum, A. laidlawii and A. axanthum were detected. A. axanthum showed pathogenicity for goslings and goose embryos. Its effect is exacerbated by associated parvovirus infection.

A total of 1 874 birds belonging to 99 species was investigated on the presence of trypanosomes in Czechoslovakia, using the method of blood smears and cultivation from peripheral blood (PEN method) and autopsies with subsequent cultivation from the bone marrow. Apart from a single finding in owls, the trypanosomes were detected only in passerines which represent the majority of birds investigated (1 518 specimens belonging to 66 species). Except for sparrows, in which trypanosomes were present very rarely, they were abundant practically in all bird families represented by a sufficient number of specimens. Autopsies showed that trypanosomes occurred on the average in 23.6% of passerines. Throughout the year their presence in peripheral blood of birds ranged from a peak in June (29% of positive passerines after PEN method) to their absence in the winter months. There were differences in the incidence of trypanosomes in birds coming from localities with different biotopes. No essential difference was found in their incidence in migratory and non migratory birds. In birds several years old the incidence of trypanosomes was higher than in younger birds. Repeated investigations of ringed birds recaptured point out long-lasting infections with avian trypanosomes. A considerable correlation between the incidence of trypanosomes and that of Leucocytozoon, Haemoproteus and microfilariae indicates that avian trypanosomes are probably transmitted by blackflies (Simuliidae), biting midges (Ceratopogonidae) and louse flies (Hippoboscidae).

The experiments performed on 90 male goslings showed that 6 h cold exposure (5 +/- 1 degree C) of the specimens 3, 10 and 21-day-old increases considerably 131I uptake by their thyroid gland. After single subcutaneous injection of thyroxine (100 mug/kg) no significant alterations of the metabolic rate, during 4 h measurements, in comparison with the pre-injection value were observed. Since, in control birds about 17% decrease of the metabolic rate within the same time occurred, as the effect of fasting, it was concluded that thyroxine does have the calorigenic effect. The metabolic rate of the goslings 5 to 7-day-old treated with thyroxine for four consecutive days (100 mug/kg daily) and the control ones was very similar. In the older goslings (22--24 days) thyroxine treatment significantly elevated the metabolic rate. Direct (extrathyroid) effect of TSH on heat production, did not occur in goslings.

Immunocytochemical localization of arginine vasotocin (AVT) in the neurohypophysis of the migratory Canada goose was studied during six periods (Spring premigratory, Spring postmigratory, breeding, moulting, Fall or Autumn premigratory, and Fall postmigratory) of its annual life cycle. Ultrastructural changes in the pars nervosa, with emphasis on the axonal endings, were also examined during the above periods. In the Spring premigratory period, the staining intensity for AVT was greater in the anterior median eminence than in the pars nervosa where the density of axonal secretory granules was lower than that in the preceding period, in both sexes. During moulting females seemed to be under greater osmotic stress than males as indicated by low AVT staining intensity and secretory granule concentration in the pars nervosa. The occurrence of considerable amounts of lipofuscin bodies in the pars nervosa of both sexes during moulting was indicative of high lysosomal activity in the pituicytes. AVT release is recognized as a significant event in initiating Spring migration.

The profile of ERalpha and ERbeta gene expression in the ovaries of Zi geese at 1 day and 1,2, 3, 4, 5 and 8 months of age (n=8, respectively) was examined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The results showed that the expression of ERalpha and ERbeta mRNA was greater at 1 to 5 and 8 months compared with that observed at 1 day. In particular, the level of expression of ERalpha and ERbeta at 8 months was greater, 2.47 +/- 0.23 fold and 29.07 +/- 1.25 fold, respectively, compared with that at 1 day (P<0.05). The expression of ERalpha mRNA was not significantly different at 1, 2, 3 and 4 months (P>0.05). The level of expression of ERalpha mRNA at 5 months was 1.86 +/- 0.17 fold higher than at 1 day (P<0.05). The level of expression of ERbeta mRNA at 2, 3, 4, 5 and 8 months (1.96 +/- 0.13, 2.58 +/- 0.08, 2.08 +/- 0.05, 3.25 +/- 0.11 and 29.07 +/- 1.25 fold, respectively, P<0.05) was significantly higher than at 1 day. In summary, the expression of ERalpha and ERbeta mRNA in the ovaries of geese was increased between newborn and the laying stage. These results suggest that ERalpha and ERbeta mediate the process of ovarian development and egg laying in geese. In addition, ERbeta may play a more important role in regulating the response of the ovary to estrogen during the developmental and egg-laying stages.

Starvation in 15 geese (mean initial body mass, m = 6.3 kg) fasting for about 40 days (mean decrease in m = 2.5 kg) was characterized by three periods. Period I (3-8 days), an adaptation period, was marked by a considerable decrease in the daily rate of change in m (dm) as well as in resting metabolic rate (RMR), and by high fat mobilization. In period II (a period of economy) the decreases in dm, RMR, and daily rate of nitrogen excretion (dne) were reduced: when expressed per unit of body mass these rates were either constant or decreased slightly. Period III, a critical period, was characterized by a rapid increase in both dm and dne that appeared when body mass had dropped to 4.7-3.2 kg. In parallel there was a greater decrease in intracellular fluid volume below 5 kg. Throughout the fast, in contrast to fasting mammals, plasma glucose and alanine concentrations were maintained at high levels (8-10 and 0.4 mM, respectively), and there was no increase in acetoacetate. However, after 20 days of fasting, plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration (beta-OHB) increased to about 20 mM, while blood pH remained constant and blood PCO2 decreased. Thus, compensation for metabolic acidosis was partly attributed to respiratory alkalosis. Throughout the fast, the variations in beta-OHB were a mirror image of those for daily changes in body mass and in nitrogen excretion. This presumably reflects a hormonal change, but might also suggest a key role of beta-OHB in the control of energy expenditure and/or in regulation of body mass as well as in protein sparing.

Reoviruses have recently been shown to be associated with disease in young geese and to be involved in epizooties of severe outcome in Hungary. To assess the genetic variability among these pathogenic goose reoviruses (GRVs), we sequenced the S4 genome segment of five GRV strains isolated from different diseased flocks. We found that the GRV S4 genome segment, consisting of two partially overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), shares substantial structural similarity with its counterpart in muscovy duck reoviruses (DRVs). ORF1 is predicted to encode a polypeptide highly similar to the p10 polypeptide of DRV, and ORF2 supposedly encodes the minor outer capsid protein, sigma1/sigmaC. In one of the five GRV strains examined, we identified a single uracil base insertion close to the middle of ORF2. This insertion resulted in a frameshift and in concomitant acquisition of a termination codon (UAA) a few codons downstream, apparently causing truncation of the C-terminal part of the protein. The functional consequences of this assumed mutation, which would result in loss of more than a half of the protein, have yet to be determined. Nonetheless, the sequence and structural similarities between the genome segment encoding sigmal/sigmaC in GRVs and DRVs suggest that these viruses belong to a species distinct from other established species within subgroup 2 of orthoreoviruses.

An examination of antibody to reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) in sera of chickens and other avian species collected from various districts in Japan was carried out. Agar gel immunodiffusion test (AGID) to the chicken sera revealed positive results in 25.9% of the 54 farms, 21.4% of the 126 flocks and 14.3% of the 1,892 individual chickens. All the AGID positive sera also were positive in indirect immunofluorescence and/or virus neutralization tests. In avian species other than chickens, Peking ducks (1/120; 0.4%) and pheasants (4/27; 14.8%) were AGID test positive. This is the first study conducted in Japan.

TLR7 is a transmembrane endosomal protein that plays an essential role in innate antiviral responses via the recognition of conserved viral molecular patterns. Here, we cloned the full-length cDNA of goose TLR7 and carried out a molecular characterization of goose TLR7. The goose TLR7 gene is 3900 bp and encodes a 1045 amino acid protein with high homology to poultry (93% to duck and 83% to chicken). Similar conclusions were made by phylogenetic analysis. The predicted protein secondary structure of goose TLR7 contained a conserved Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain and characteristic leucine-rich repeat regions, which has also been reported for duck TLR7. Additionally, the tissue distribution of goose TLR7 suggests that immune-associated tissues, especially the cecal tonsil and bursa of Fabricius, have high goose TLR7 expression levels. Goose TLR7 is abundantly expressed in lung tissues, which is distinct from its expression in chickens. Similar to duck TLR7, goose spleen mononuclear cells (MNCs) exposed to the mammalian TLR7 agonists R848 and Imiquimod showed significant induction of the production of proinflammatory cytokines and IFN-α. New type gosling viral enteritis virus (NGVEV) infection resulted in high mRNA expression levels of goose TLR7 in the spleen. By contrast, no direct interaction between NGVEV and goose TLR7 was detected after infecting goose spleen MNCs with NGVEV in vitro. However, triggering of goose TLR7 resulted in the rapid up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and anti-viral molecules, suggesting that goose TLR7 plays an important role in anti-viral defense.

The red-breasted goose Branta ruficollis is a globally threatened species (IUCN Vulnerable) and the only European goose species currently in decline. Working on the wintering grounds on the Black Sea Coast, we address two potential causes of decline of this species for the first time: lead poisoning, and contamination from pesticides. We quantified the densities of spent Pb shot in three wetlands used by the geese in north-east Bulgaria, and analysed the Pb concentration in the faeces of red-breasted geese and the more abundant greater white-fronted geese Anser albifrons, using Al concentration as an indicator of soil ingestion. Pb shot densities in sediments were low, and we found no evidence for Pb shot ingestion in red-breasted geese. On the other hand, we found that the geese were feeding on wheat whose seeds were treated with four fungicides: thiram, tebuconazole, difenoconazole and fludioxonil, and the two first were even detected in geese faecal samples. Using data on the daily food intake, we estimated the exposure levels of the geese to these fungicides, both by measuring the concentrations remaining on seeds and by estimating the amount used to coat the seeds at the time of sowing. We found that the exposure rates estimated during the sowing period for both geese species can exceed the recognized hazardous doses for thiram, and to a lesser extent for tebuconazole, which indicates that some pesticides may be playing a previously overlooked role in the decline of red-breasted geese.

Over a period of 9 yr, seven white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons) and one Canada goose (Branta canadensis) with multiple intramuscular mesenchymal tumors were encountered in Saskatchewan (Canada) and one similarly affected Canada goose was seen on Prince Edward Island (Canada). The tumors in these birds consisted either of adipose tissue, fibroblastic tissue, or a mixture of both types of tissues. The high prevalence of this condition in white-fronted geese suggested a genetic influence.

The complete nucleotide sequences of two parvoviruses isolated from goose and muscovy duck were determined. The two virus genomes share 81.9% nucleotide sequence identity, indicating that they are closely related. The coding regions are bracketed by inverted terminal repeats containing palindromes. This is similar to the genome organization of human parvoviruses, adeno-associated virus 2, and B19. Amino acid sequence comparison shows that the closest relative of the goose and muscovy duck parvoviruses is adeno-associated virus 2. This is surprising, because the goose and muscovy duck parvoviruses do not require any helper virus for productive replication, suggesting that adeno-associated virus 2 has been derived from a helper-independent ancestor.

The genomes of novel circoviruses from goose and pigeon, which were isolated using degenerate primer and inverse primer PCR methods, were cloned and sequenced. Comparative nucleotide (nt) sequence analyses showed that the goose circovirus (GCV) and pigeon circovirus (PiCV) possessed genomes which were 1821 and 2037 or 2036 nt, respectively, and which had features in common with the genomes of porcine circoviruses types 1 and 2 (PCV1, PCV2) and psittacine beak and feather disease virus (BFDV), such that they can now be assigned to the genus Circovirus of the family Circoviridae. Common features include the possession of (i) a potential stem-loop/nonanucleotide motif with which the initiation of rolling circle replication of the virus DNA is associated; (ii) two major ORFs, located on the virus (V1 ORF) and complementary (C1 ORF) strands, which encode the replication-associated protein (Rep) and capsid protein, respectively; (iii) high levels of amino acid identity (41.2--58.2%) shared with other circovirus Rep proteins; and (iv) direct/inverted repeat sequences within the putative intergenic region. On the basis of nt and amino acid sequence identities, GCV is substantially less closely related to BFDV than PiCV is to BFDV.

Amphotericin B enhances Na+ conductance of the mucosal membrane of gallbladder epithelial cells and in such a way it modifies the brush border electromotive force. On this basis a method to measure cell and shunt resistances by comparing changes of the mucosal membrane potential (Vm) and of the transmural p.d. (Vms) is developed. This method is applied in gallbladders of different vertebrate species (i.e. rabbit, guinea pig, goose, tortoise, toad, trout). The two tested mammals, rabbit and guinea pig, exhibited a lower shunting percentage (89--93%) than the nonmammals (96--97%), but this fact did not bring about a homogeneous positive Vms. This means that shunting percent contributes, but it is not the only source of differences in Vms, in accordance with that reported by Gelarden and Rose (J. Membrane Biol. 19:37, 1974). Moreover, mammals exhibited a lower luminal resistance and a lower ratio between luminal and basolateral resistance than nonmammals. Possible causes of these differences are discussed.

This study investigated the potential of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for quantitative determination of total pigments in red meats, including beef, goose, and duck. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) was applied to correlate the spectral data with the reference values of total pigments measured by a traditional method. In order to simplify the PLSR model based on the full spectra, eleven optimal wavelengths were selected using successive projections algorithm (SPA). The new SPA-PLSR model yielded good results with the coefficient of determination (R(2)p) of 0.953, root mean square error (RMSEP) of 9.896, and ratio of prediction to deviation (RPD) of 4.628. Finally, distribution maps of total pigments in red meats were developed using an image processing algorithm. The overall results from this study indicated HSI had the capability for predicting total pigments in red meats.

In order to figure out the effect of CaCl2 on the tenderizing pathway of goose meat, breast muscles of thirty-two Eastern Zhejiang White Geese were divided into three treatments: the control, 150 and 300mM CaCl2. Shear force, myofibrillar fraction index (MFI), actin filaments and F-actin, G-actin and tropomodulins (Tmods) levels were investigated during 168h. Results showed that 300mM treatment had lower shear force at 48, 96 and 168h and higher MFI at 24, 48, 96 and 168h than the control. The rate of actin filaments disruption, the decrease of F-actin, the degradation of Tmods, the increase of G-actin in 300mM treatment was faster than 150mM treatment; the rate in the control was the slowest among treatments. CaCl2 accelerated the transformation of F-actin into G-actin. We concluded that CaCl2 tenderized goose meat by depolymerizing actin filaments and cleaving Tmods.

An extensive survey of the post-1960 literature on the lipids of fowl has been completed. This review shows that the total lipid content of chicken tissues increases with age. The fatty acid composition of both chicken and turkey tissues reflects the fatty acid composition of the dietary fat. The fatty acid composition data for dark meat, light meat, or skin of all classes of chicken --broiler-fryer, roaster, and stewing hen--raised on diets equivalent to commercial feed were combined into single tissue-type fatty acid profiles. Similar profiles were also established for roaster-fryer turkey, young tom turkey, and young hen turkey. Breed, sex, and environmental temperature showed only minor effects on the tissue fatty acid compositions. Young chicken flesh contains less fat than that of stewing hens, turkeys, and other fowl, which all have approximately equal total fat content. White meat of chicken and turkey contains the least amount of fat, and the skin of all birds contained the largest amount, duck and goose skin containing the greatest of all. Tables of the total fat and fatty acid composition of tissue and tissue composites of fowl are given. Studies on chicken and turkey tissues were sufficiently numerous that the computed fatty acid compositions in the tables are considered reliable representation of market birds. Data for goose, duck, partridge, pheasant, pigeon, and quail were computed from sparse information and should be viewedas provisional guides.

Haemorrhagic nephritis and enteritis of geese as a new disease was first described in Hungary in 1969. The authors identified the causative agent of the outbreaks occurring in 1969 as a polyomavirus by PCR in 2001. In order to study the pathogenesis of the virus, one-day-old goslings were infected with tissue homogenate that tested positive for polyomavirus by PCR. Morphological, light and transmission electron microscopic (TEM) examinations have revealed that goose haemorrhagic polyomavirus replicates in the endothelial cells of the blood vessels and capillaries of diseased birds. Infection causes damage and necrosis of the endothelial cells. The virus was not observed in the parenchymal cells. Oedema and haemorrhages found throughout the body may be due to the dysfunction or functional deficiency of endothelial cells damaged by the virus.

Kidneys from 309 Interior Canada geese from three locations in the Mississippi Flyway were examined for renal coccidia. Oocysts and/or young zygotes of Eimeria sp. were found in 6.8% of goose kidneys sampled. Only one type of renal coccidian oocyst was observed. Significantly more immature geese were infected than adults; however, there was no significant difference observed between the prevalences of infection in male and female birds. A host cellular response to zygotes and oocysts was noted in the majority of infected adult geese. Heavily infected kidneys were hypertrophic with minute foci on the surface of the organ. Histological examinations showed large numbers of unsporulated oocysts accumulated in distended collecting tubules, resulting in pressure necrosis to adjacent tissue and urate retention. Zygotes were observed in the cytoplasm of tubule cells and extracellularly in interstitial tissue. Infected tubule cells were characterized by the peripheral location of the nuclei, cytoplasmic basophilia, and cellular hypertrophy. This is the first report of an Eimeria sp. in the kidneys of Canada geese of the Mississippi Valley population.

Usutu virus (USUV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus of the Japanese encephalitis virus group, which has been associated with avian mortality in Austria since 2001. The affected birds are predominantly Eurasian blackbirds (Turdus merula). In the present study, the pathogenicity of USUV for domestic geese (Anser anser f. domestica) was investigated. Eleven 2-week-old geese were inoculated intramuscularly with 5 x 10(4) 50% tissue culture infectious dose of USUV strain Vienna-2001 blackbird. No clinical signs were seen during the observation period. Four inoculated and one in-contact geese died without preceding clinical signs. Two of the deaths could be attributed to bacterial septicaemia and strangulation, respectively. The cause of death of two experimental and one in-contact animals remained unclear, but lack of evidence for viral lesions and viral antigen in their tissues argued against association with the USUV infection. Although in organs of the majority of inoculated geese (9/11) USUV was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry for USUV antigen was negative in all tissues of all geese. Evidence of plasma viraemia or viral excretion was found in one goose only. Seroconversion was detected in three inoculated geese 10 days post-inoculation. Geese placed in contact with inoculated geese and control animals did not exhibit USUV in their internal organs or plasma and lacked USUV-specific antibodies. This experiment shows that USUV is able to replicate in geese, but does not induce clinical disease, is unlikely to induce mortality, and only infrequently leads to viraemia or virus shedding.

Increased resource availability can facilitate establishment of exotic plant species, especially when coincident with propagule supply. Following establishment, increased resource availability may also facilitate the spread of exotic plant species if it enhances their competitive abilities relative to native species. Exotic Canada geese (Branta canadensis) introduce both exotic grass seed and nutrients to an endangered plant community on the Gulf Islands of southwestern British Columbia, Canada. I used greenhouse experiments to assess the competitive advantage of the exotic grasses relative to native and exotic forbs in this community and to test the impacts of nutrient addition from goose feces on competitive outcomes. I grew experimental communities varying in their proportion of forbs versus exotic grasses, and added goose feces as a nutrient source. I found that both native and exotic forbs produced significantly more biomass in competition with conspecifics than in competition with the grasses, and that the proportional abundance of two out of three native forbs was lowest in the combined presence of exotic grasses and nutrient addition. In a second experiment, I found that in monoculture all species of forbs and grasses showed equal growth responses to nutrients. The exotic species did not convert additional nutrients into additional biomass at a higher rate, but did germinate earlier and grow larger than the native species regardless of nutrient availability. This suggests that the exotic species may have achieved their competitive advantage partly by pre-empting resources in community mixtures. Small and late-germinating native forbs may be particularly vulnerable to competitive suppression from exotic grasses and forbs and may be at an even greater disadvantage if their competitors are benefiting from early access to additional nutrients. In combination, the input of exotic propagules and additional nutrients by nesting geese may compromise efforts to maintain native community composition in this system.

1. The effect of dimethylacetamide (DMA) and dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) on the cryopreservation of gander semen were investigated. An improved survival rate of spermatozoa after freeze-thawing was obtained when semen was frozen by a fast-freezing procedure on dry ice with 9% DMA as the cryoprotectant. 2. Gander semen, which was frozen during mid season, was tested for fertilising ability in different times of the season. The percentage of fertility during d 3 to d 9 after 2 consecutive inseminations was 68% to 95%, depending on the date of artificial insemination.

Radiolabeled Sindbis virus was found to bind to protein-free lipid model membranes (liposomes) derived from extracts of sheep erythrocytes. The virus interaction was dependent on initial pH, and the range of pH dependence (pH 6.0 to 6.8) was the same as the observed with virus-dependent hemagglutination. After the initial interaction, pH changes no longer influenced the virus binding to liposomes. Virus bound to liposomes prepared from a mixture of erythrocyte phospholipids, but the binding was greatly diminished when either cholesterol or phosphatidylethanolamine was omitted from the liposomal lipid mixture. It was concluded that phospholipids and cholesterol, in a bilayer configuration, may be sufficient for specific virus binding in the absence of membrane protein.

Geographic variation in pathogenicity of Leucocytozoon simondi in Canada geese (Branta canadensis maxima) was investigated by exposing goslings to natural infection at three locations in the upper peninsula of Michigan. Examination of blood smears and tissue sections revealed two patterns of development. Hepatic schizogony and secondary megaloschizogony occurred in cells of the reticuloendothelial system, with round and elongate gametocytes, or only hepatic schizonts and round gametocytes. The evidence for strain differences in L. simondi and its implications in wildfowl management practices are discussed.

Avian cholera is reported for the first time in Canada geese, Branta canadensis, of the Mississippi Valley population. The disease was detected in weekly surveillance transects and was responsible for the loss of about 850 geese during the winter of 1978-1979 at localized areas in southern Illinois. Necropsies performed on 480 geese that died at Union County Conservation Area and on 133 birds at Horseshoe Lake Conservation Area during January and February 1979 revealed that the majority of losses (64%) were caused by avian cholera. Lead poisoning was responsible for the death of 14% of the geese analyzed and the remaining 22%, most of which were decomposed, were undiagnosed. Lethal lead levels and Pasteurella multocida occurred concomitantly in a few instances.

The contamination of waterways with fecal material is a persistent threat to public health. Identification of the sources of fecal contamination is a vital component for abatement strategies and for determination of total maximum daily loads. While phenotypic and genotypic techniques have been used to determine potential sources of fecal bacteria in surface waters, most methods require construction of large known-source libraries, and they often fail to adequately differentiate among environmental isolates originating from different animal sources. In this study, we used pooled genomic tester and driver DNAs in suppression subtractive hybridizations to enrich for host source-specific DNA markers for Escherichia coli originating from locally isolated geese. Seven markers were identified. When used as probes in colony hybridization studies, the combined marker DNAs identified 76% of the goose isolates tested and cross-hybridized, on average, with 5% of the human E. coli strains and with less than 10% of the strains obtained from other animal hosts. In addition, the combined probes identified 73% of the duck isolates examined, suggesting that they may be useful for determining the contribution of waterfowl to fecal contamination. However, the hybridization probes reacted mainly with E. coli isolates obtained from geese in the upper midwestern United States, indicating that there is regional specificity of the markers identified. Coupled with high-throughput, automated macro- and microarray screening, these markers may provide a quantitative, cost-effective, and accurate library-independent method for determining the sources of genetically diverse E. coli strains for use in source-tracking studies. However, future efforts to generate DNA markers specific for E. coli must include isolates obtained from geographically diverse animal hosts.

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) was correlated with immune response for extra-antigen. MHC sequences of chicken, other birds, crawl species and mammalian were derived from GenBank/DDBJ/EMBL and analyzed by alignment, and then primers were designed. By means of LA-PCR method, MHC Classgene was cloned from Wulong goose genomic DNA and total RNA, and the structure of MHC Classgenomic DNA was analyzed using bioinformation methods. The results showed that the genomic DNA, which consisted of 8 extrons and 7 introns, had 64.1% amino acids homologous to chicken and 42.9% amino acids to human. The molecular phylogenetic tree further revealed evolutionary relationship between Wulong goose and other animals such as chicken, other birds, crawl species, mammalian and human. The results of homologous modeling showed that Wulong Goose MHC Classgene was formed by amidocyanogen (N) terminal structure region and carboxyl (C) terminal structure region.

Coccidiosis is recognized as one of the most widespread and pathogenic parasitic infections in migratory waterfowl throughout the world. It can be caused by several species of Eimeria. We sequenced the complete mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) of Eimeria anseris from wintering greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons) in China. The complete E. anseris mtDNA is 6179 bp in size and contains three protein-coding genes (CYT B, COI, and COIII), 12 gene fragments for large subunit ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and seven gene fragments for small subunit rRNA, but no transfer RNA genes. Available complete Eimeria mtDNA sequences are highly conserved in sequence: the sequences are all similar in length; with the same three protein-coding genes and fragmented rRNA genes; ATG is generally the start codon, and TAA and TAG are the most frequently used stop codons. Our molecular phylogenetic analyses show some species clustering into host-specific clades, but many species do not follow clear coevolutionary host segregating patterns. The results suggest that Eimeria spp. from turkeys and chickens are paraphyletic groups, while Eimeria species isolated from rabbits are a monophyletic group. E. anseris, which infects A. albifrons, and another group of Eimeria isolated from chickens form a closely related monophyletic clade.

This study was performed to determine the slaughter and carcass traits, meat color, pH, nutrient composition, fatty acids, amino acids, and cholesterol content of local Turkish goose varieties. In the present study, a total of 80 geese from white, black, gray, and multicolored varieties were reared in an extensive production system at 28 wk of age. Quality analysis was performed on breast and thigh meat, as well as on the skin and abdominal fat of studied geese. Slaughter and carcass weights were significantly higher in the white variety (P < 0.01). Measured abdominal fat was lower in black and gray geese. Furthermore, the color and pH values were significantly different on breast, thigh, and skin among varieties. Additionally, measured breast meat b*, thigh meat L*, and b* values were higher in male geese. Breast meat protein levels were lower in black and gray geese, and also lower in the thigh meat of gray geese. Total breast meat amino acids were lower in white geese, and the amino acid content of thigh meat was lower in multicolored varieties. Moreover, differences in fatty acid composition were found among the studied varieties. However, cholesterol levels did not differ for either sex or variety.

The characteristics changes of apoptosis of Duck Embryo Fibroblasts (DEF) cells induced by New type gosling viral enteritis virus, NGVEV) were observed by means of HE staining, electron microscopy and Annexin V-FITC/PI fluorescent staining. During 24-48 h post infection (pi), the difference of morphological change between infected DEF cells and the mock infected cells was invisible. At 72 h pi, the nuclear chromatin was getting condensed through HE staining; apoptotic morphological change such as abnormal shape of the nucleus, condensation of the cytoplasm and chromatin were observed under electron microscope; and the early apoptotic cells (Annexin V-FITC positive and PI negative) were detected under fluorescence microscope. At 96-120 h pi, by means of HE staining and electron microscopy, the advanced morphological change of apoptosis such as formation of different kinds of apoptotic bodies, and shrink of the DEF cells and nucleus were detected; under fluorescence microscope the different stages of the apoptotic DEF can be easily distinguished: early apoptotic cells (Annexin V-FITC postive and pi negative), advanced or late apoptotic cells (both Annexin V-FITC and PI positive), necrosis cells or dead cells (Annexin V-FITC negative and PI positive). This investigation shows that NGVEV might induce apoptosis and form characteristic apoptotic morphological changes in the DEF cells. NGVEV inducement of apoptosis may be an important mechanism of efficient dissemination of virus progeny.

To provide information on the mechanism of perpetuation of influenza viruses among waterfowl reservoirs in nature, virological surveillance was carried out in Alaska during their breeding season in summer from 1991 to 1994. Influenza viruses were isolated mainly from fecal samples of dabbling ducks in their nesting places in central Alaska. The numbers of subtypes of 108 influenza virus isolates were 1 H2N3, 37 H3N8, 55 H4N6, 1 H7N3, 1 H8N2, 1 H10N2, 11 H10N7, and H10N9. Influenza viruses were also isolated from water samples of the lakes where they nest. Even in September of 1994 when the most ducks had left for migration to south, viruses were still isolated from the lake water. Phylogenetic analysis of the NP genes of the representative isolates showed that they belong to the North American lineage of avian influenza viruses, suggesting that the majority of the waterfowls breeding in central Alaska migrate to North America and not to Asia. The present results support the notion that influenza viruses have been maintained in waterfowl population by water-borne transmission and revealed the mechanism of year-by-year perpetuation of the viruses in the lakes where they breed.

Gleason Basin, a marsh located in the western part of the Rainwater Basin in Nebraska, was selected during the 1980 spring waterfowl migration as a study site to determine the presence and persistence of virulent Pasteurella multocida. Avian cholera mortality in migratory waterfowl using the Basin increased during a 2-wk period of a die-off beginning the first week of March when 2,409 carcasses were collected from the marsh. Study sites within the marsh were established for sampling water associated with and not associated with intact and scavenged carcasses. Isolations of virulent P. multocida were made from five of six study sites associated with either intact or scavenged carcasses for 3 days and from three of five non-carcass-associated study sites for 2 days. Recovery of these bacteria from this environment suggested a possible source of infection for susceptible waterfowl using the contaminated site.

Studies have shown that not only does palmitic acid promote triglyceride (TG) accumulation, but it also affects cell viability in in vitro steatosis models. However, to what degree these effects are mediated by steatosis in goose primary hepatocytes is unknown. In this study, the effects of palmitic acid on the lipid metabolism homeostasis pathway and on apoptosis were determined. The authors measured the mRNA levels of genes involved in TG synthesis, lipid deposition, fatty acid oxidation and the assembly and secretion of VLDL-TG in goose primary hepatocytes. The results indicated that palmitic acid can significantly reduce the activity of goose hepatocytes, and that palmitic acid had a significant effect on TG accumulation; however, with increasing palmitic acid concentrations, the extracellular TG and extracellular VLDL concentration gradually decreased. With increasing palmitic acid concentrations, the gene expression levels of DGAT1, DGAT2, PPARα, CPT-1, FoxO1 and MTTP (which regulate hepatic TG synthesis, fatty acid oxidation and the assembly and secretion of VLDL-TGs) first increased and then decreased; the change in PLIN gene expression was palmitic acid dose-dependent, similar to the regulatory mode of intracellular TG accumulation. In conclusion, this study clearly shows that palmitic acid can promote TG accumulation and induce apoptosis in goose primary hepatocytes, and this effect may be related to the lipid metabolism pathway.

Since January 2019, abnormal molting has been observed frequently in approximately 40-day-old Pekin ducks in China. To investigate the possible involvement of a virus, we tested the prevalence of duck circovirus (DuCV), goose hemorrhagic polyomavirus (GHPyV), and goose parvovirus (GPV) in 11 molt cases in two provinces. GPV was detected in all cases, particularly in all samples collected from the feather area. The complete genome sequences of three GPV strains were determined and found to have 52 nucleotide changes relative to GPVs associated with short beak and dwarfism syndrome of Pekin ducks. These data will enhance our understanding of GPV diversity and outcomes of GPV infection in Pekin ducks.

The use of near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) on a meat product is described in this report. The aim of the study was to develop calibration equations to predict the chemical composition of goose fatty liver (foie gras) with lipid contents greater than 40% of the fresh pate. Spectra of 52 foie gras samples were collected in the visible and NIR region (400 to 2,498 nm). Calibration equations were computed for DM, CP, lipids and fatty acids using modified partial least-squares regression. R2 values were high for the total lipid content (0.805) and DM (0.908) but were low for ash (0.151) and relatively low for protein content (0.255). For the major fatty acids, R2 ranged from 0.886 for palmitic acid to 0.988 for oleic acid. Oleic acid, the main fatty acid of the liver, and the stearic acid had higher R2 values than the less represented fatty acids. This study suggests that the NIRS technique can be used to predict lipid content and the fatty acid composition of goose fatty livers, but calibration must be built on a larger number of samples to generate accurate predictions.

The analysis of specificity of blastocysts was based on the data on host association and on experimental data. In experiments we failed to infect the geese (Anser anser) with Blastocystis galli taken from the fowl (Gallus gallus) and also failed to infect the fowl with B. suis taken from the pigs (Sus scrofa domestica). Experimental data and field observations of blastocysts distribution among different groups of hosts point out that the same species of blastocysts can not parasitize in hosts belonging to different classes and orders. The examination of 89 fish specimens belonging to 14 species of Osteichthyes taken from the Neman delta did not discover any blastocysts.

H5 influenza viruses have caused much alarm globally due to their high pathogenic potential. As yet we have not seen sustained spread of the virus amongst humans despite a high prevalence of the virus in avian populations. Nevertheless, isolated human cases of infection have demonstrated high mortality and there are substantial efforts being taken to monitor the evolution of the virus and to undertake preparedness activities. Here we review and discuss the evolution of the A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 (H5N1) virus with emphasis on recent events.

This study was carried out to induce out-of-season breeding, in the summer, and to achieve high reproductive performance using artificial photoperiod manipulation in the long-day breeding Yangzhou goose. Young geese were subject to a two-phase short-to-long (group A) or a three-phase (long-short-long; group B) photoperiod program February through October. Egg-laying was induced to start similarly in both groups in May, increased to a peak level in July, and then decreased gradually through to October. The peak and post-peak laying rates were higher with the three-phase than with the two-phase program. Plasma progesterone concentrations changed similarly in the two groups, increasing from low levels during the pre-lay periods until the peak laying stage, then decreasing with decline in the egg-laying rate. Plasma T3 concentrations increased from the beginning of the experiment to form the first peak under a short photoperiod, declined to a trough at peak lay and then progressively increased to high levels towards the end of the experiment. Plasma T4 concentrations increased throughout the experiment, showing little response to changes in photoperiod. GnIH mRNA expression level in the hypothalamus steadily decreased from high levels under the short photoperiod to a nadir at peak of lay, but was abruptly up-regulated by over a thousand-fold thereafter. This mRNA expression pattern was also shared by GnIHR, VIPR, TRHR, TSH, and PRL genes in the pituitary gland, and to lesser extent, by GnRH, VIP, and TRH genes in the hypothalamus. Pituitary GnRHR mRNA expression levels changed in a similar manner to that of reproductive activities of geese in both groups. FSH beta subunits mRNA expression levels increased to high levels after day 11 of the long photoperiod, and were higher in group B than in group A at peak laying. LH beta gene expression level was similarly upregulated by photoperiod and was higher in group B than in group A when used the multivariable and two-way analyses of variance. Taken together, photoperiod, through regulation of expression of an array of genes in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, synchronized stimulation and refractoriness of the reproductive system in Yangzhou geese. The higher out-of-season egg laying performance following the three-phase photo-program treatment was mediated by higher FSH beta and LH beta subunit mRNA expression levels.

Ten Canada geese (Branta canadensis), 24 snow geese (Chen caerulescens) and 22 white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons) from coastal Texas (USA) were examined for helminths. Three cestode, seven nematode, and three trematode species were collected. Gizzard nematodes (Amidostomum anseris, A. spatulatum and Epomidiostomum crami) infected 53 of 54 birds. Gross lesions were not attributed to helminth infections and the host population does not appear to be impaired by them.

B-cell activating factor (BAFF), belonging to the TNF family, is critical for B cell survival and maturation. cDNA of goose BAFF (gBAFF) was amplified from goose spleen by RT-PCR. The open reading frame (ORF) of gBAFF encodes a protein of 288-amino acid. The gBAFF shows 98, 92, 44 and 55% amino acid sequence identity with duck (dBAFF), chicken (cBAFF), mouse (mBAFF) and human BAFF (hBAFF), respectively. RT-PCR results showed that gBAFF mRNA is expressed in thymus and more highly expressed in the bursa of Fabricius and spleen. Recombinant soluble gBAFF (gsBAFF) expressed in Escherichia coli has molecular weight of approximately 19kDa. In vitro, purified gsBAFF was able to promote bursa B cells survival/proliferation in goose, duck and chicken. Furthermore, recombinant dsBAFF and csBAFF have a positive effect on goose, duck and chicken bursa B cells survival/proliferation. These findings indicate that gBAFF plays an important role in the survival/proliferation of goose B cells and, owing to its high evolutionary conservation, functional cross-reactivity exists between chicken, duck and goose BAFF.

CD3 is one of the most important cell surface markers of T lymphocytes which play an important role in signal transmission of antigen recognition. In this study, goose CD3ε gene was cloned by touchdown PCR with the template of goose thymus cDNA. The complete open reading frame of goose CD3ε encoded 178 amino acid residues with a 21 signal peptide. Sequence alignments showed that goose CD3ε had an amino acid sequence similarity to duck (80.3%) and chicken (66.3%). The extracellular domain of goose CD3ε was efficiently expressed as fusion protein in Escherichia coli, purified by a Ni-NTA agarose column, and the purified recombinant protein was used to produce anti-GoCD3εex polyclonal antibodies. The characteristics of PAb were identified by Western blot, cellular ELISA, IFA, FCM, and LSCM analysis. These results may be useful for a better understanding of goose CD3ε and have a foundation for the study of T cell mediated immune mechanism in waterfowl.

Most research in avian brain lateralisation has been done using birds under laboratory conditions rather than natural settings. I studied eye preference during feeding in coot and geese when head position only allows use of one eye for vigilance. Birds regularly interrupt feeding to be vigilant. This behaviour is directed towards detecting predators. Recently, evidence was found that birds might perform some kind of "low-cost" vigilance even during feeding. Because coot and geese often turn their head to either side during feeding, laterality in head turning is expected to follow a consistent pattern in which the eye used for detecting predators should be less often directed towards the obstructive ground. Coot and geese were digitally videotaped and the number of pecks with either side oriented towards the ground at an angle of at least 45 degrees was counted. I found a strong bias in swan geese oriented their left eye towards the ground and thus using the right eye for vigilance during feeding. Coot showed a similar but less pronounced pattern, while in greylag geese no preference could be detected.

Mycoplasma sp. 1220 can induce inflammation primarily in the genital and respiratory tracts of waterfowl, leading to serious economic losses. Adequate housing and appropriate antibiotic treatment are promoted in the control of the disease. The aim of the present study was to determine the in vitro susceptibility to thirteen different antibiotics and an antibiotic combination of thirty-eight M. sp. 1220 strains isolated from geese and a duck in several parts of Hungary, Central Europe between 2011 and 2015.

This study evaluated the heterocyclic aromatic amine (HAA) contents and quality characteristics of seven kinds of traditional smoked and roasted poultry products on the northern Chinese market. Harbin smoked chicken had the most abundant total HAAs, followed by Haroulian roasted chicken and Yishou smoked chicken. The contents of Norharman and Harman were much higher than those of other kinds of HAAs (P < 0.05). The water content of samples varied from 59.01% to 69.98% and the water activity varied from 0.953 to 0.976. The carbonyl content and TBARS values of the Beijing roasted duck and the Duiqing roasted goose were much higher than those of the other samples (P < 0.05). The sensory evaluation result of the Beijing roasted chicken was higher than that of the other samples (P < 0.05). Overall, the levels of HAAs in the industrial smoked and roasted products were lower than those in non-industrial products, which may provide a theoretical basis for the industrial production of smoked and roasted poultry products.

Since prehistoric times, the Bering Strait area (Beringia) has served as an avenue of dispersal between the Old and the New Worlds. On a field expedition to this area, we collected fecal samples from dabbling ducks, geese, shorebirds, and gulls on the Chukchi Peninsula, Siberia, and Pt. Barrow, Alaska, and characterized the subtypes of avian influenza virus present in them. Four of 202 samples (2%) from Alaska were positive for influenza A virus RNA in two independent polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based screening assays, while all shorebird samples from the Chukchi Peninsula were negative. Subtypes H3N8 and H6N1 were recorded once, while subtype H8N4 was found in two samples. Full-length sequences were obtained from the three unique isolates, and phylogenetic analysis with representative sequences for the Eurasian and North American lineages of influenza A virus showed that one HA gene clustered with the Eurasian rather than the North American lineage. However, the closest relative to this sequence was a North American isolate from Delaware described in 2002, indicating that a H6 spillover from Asia has established itself in North America.

1. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a multifunctional cytokine involved in lipid metabolism in adipose tissue. The objective of the study was to identify and characterize the IL-6 gene in the goose. 2. A full-length coding sequence (CDS) of the goose (Anser anser) IL-6 gene was cloned that encoded a 234-amino acid peptide containing a 38-amino acid signal peptide, an IL-6/G-CSF/MGF family consensus pattern and four conserved α-helices. The mature goose IL-6 showed 74% and 39% identities to that of chicken and human, respectively. 3. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that the goose IL-6 was predominantly expressed in liver and was up-regulated in adipocytes by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and oleic acid.

In two groups (eight individuals each) of socially acquainted, outdoor-kept, domestic ganders (male Hungarian white: Anser domesticus), basal and GnRH-stimulated plasma testosterone (T) concentrations were compared with fecal testosterone metabolites (TM) in and between three seasons, spring peak of reproductive activity, summer photorefractoriness, and fall sexual reactivation. Plasma was sampled 90 min following the challenge and T was analyzed by radioimmunoassay following the GnRH challenge. Fecal TM were measured by enzyme immunoassay using two group-specific antibodies against 17beta-OH-androgens or a novel antibody against 17-oxo groups, which was found to react with major testosterone metabolites without prior hydrolytic deconjugation. Baseline plasma T and systemic levels were high in spring and fall but low in summer. Plasma T increases in response to GnRH were followed by significantly elevated fecal TM levels 2 to 6 h following the challenge in spring and fall. In fall, at high plasma T levels, fecal TM levels were disproportionally lower than in spring. Variability of TM levels was two to five times higher in feces than in plasma, which explains why correlations between individual plasma T and fecal TM levels generally remained nonsignificant. This points to a low-level short-term relationship between the excreted TM and the plasma T levels. However, the reliability of the method was demonstrated by standard inter- and intraassay variabilities and by a high correspondence between results obtained by the two assays. It is suggested that, with appropriate sample size, fecal TM reflects plasma T increase. However, fecal TM was more variable than the plasma T, and fecal TM responses to GnRH did not always parallel the plasma T response. In addition, seasonal changes in androgen excretion regimes must be taken into account.

Thermotolerant fecal indicator organisms carried by migratory waterfowl may serve as reservoirs of antibiotic resistance. To determine the extent to which such antibiotic resistance markers were present in migratory Canada geese (Branta canadensis) on the Maryland Eastern Shore, we isolated Enterococcus spp. and Escherichia coli from fresh feces and examined the antibiotic resistance profiles of these bacteria. Samples were obtained in October 2002, January 2003, and March 2003. Thermotolerant E. coli counts ranged from 0 to 1.0x10(7) colony forming units (CFU)/0.1g (g-1) wet weight of feces, whereas Enterococcus spp. counts ranged from 1.0x10(2)-1.0x10(7) CFU g-1 wet weight of feces. Primary isolates of each indicator organism were tested against a panel of 10 antibiotics. Greater than 95% of E. coli isolates were resistant to penicillin G, ampicillin, cephalothin, and sulfathiazole; no E. coli were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Enterococcal isolates showed highest resistance to cephalothin, streptomycin, and sulfathiazole; no enterococci were resistant to chloramphenicol. The tetracyclines, streptomycin, and gentamycin provided the greatest discrimination among E. coli isolates; chlortetracycline, cephalothin, and gentamycin resistance patterns provided the greatest discrimination between enterococcal strains. Multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) profiles were calculated: fall (E. coli=0.499; enterococci=0.234), winter (E. coli=0.487; enterococci=0.389), and spring (E. coli=0.489; enterococci=0.348). E. faecalis and E. faecium, which are recognized human nosocomial pathogens, were cultured from winter (44 and 56%, respectively) and spring (13 and 31%, respectively) fecal samples.

1. It is proposed that a general biological pattern exists for chick weight increase with hen age for the various commercial species of poultry and that one general equation can be used for the estimation of chick weight increment. 2. The parameters estimated for this equation are based on (a) chick weights as a percentage of annual mean chick weight, and (b) age, from onset of lay, as a percentage of maximum age of the hen; both serving as common denominators. Hence, if the annual mean chick weight is known for any species, breed or strain, then the increase in chick weight can be predicted for the whole season, or for any particular hen age. 3. For early prediction, first-month chick weight can be used to estimate the annual mean weight and consequently the chick weight curve for the full season. Although such prediction will be somewhat less accurate, it still can be used for general planning. 4. Results indicate that chick weights of various avian species are normally distributed. Therefore, at each point of hen age, the chick weight distribution can be estimated by employing the computerised Burr's (1967) equation. This may be useful for segregating chicks by size, thus improving uniformity and reducing competition within the flock. 5. Computation results show that coefficient of variation (CV) of chick weights, originating from 22 and 62 week dam ages, is increased by up to about 75%. The CV may thus be used as a quality indicator.

Dynamics of fatty acid composition of geese liver lipids in embryogenesis and early postnatal period has been investigated. High nonsaturation of these tissues lipids is shown during all the period of researches. It is established, that in the second half of embryogenesis and in the beginning of postnatal period (first two weeks) the increase of oleic acid contents is observed with simultaneous decrease of the contents of the polynonsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) showing properties of endogenous bioregulators (arachidonic acid (AA), docosahexaenoic acid [figure: see text] (DHA). From the two-weeks age of gosling the contents of the mentioned acids changes in the opposite direction. The coordination of dynamics of TBA-active products with nonsaturation of fatty acids (FA) expressed in mEqu/g concerning double bonds, and also with respect to AA/DHA has been revealed.

Anaerobic bacterial, clostridial, and Clostridium perfringens spores were enumerated in raw goose liver samples taken after evisceration of the birds (EB) in the slaughterhouse and after removal of blood vessels from the liver (RBVL) in the cannery. The samples taken after RBVL had significantly higher (P < 0.05) spore counts than did those taken after EB, indicating contamination of livers during processing. The number of C. perfringens spores was one log cycle higher in the samples taken after RBVL than in those taken after EB (P < 0.05). The confirmation of C. perfringens according to the profiles of Rapid ID 32 A tests was carried out by means of the ATB Plus computer program. With an identification percentage of 99.9 and a T-value of 0.65, the suspect colonies proved to be C. perfringens. Therefore, the importance of an appropriate cleaning and sanitation program and of personnel hygiene should be emphasized in the industry.

When and where to move is a fundamental decision to migratory birds, and the fitness-related costs and benefits of migratory choices make them subject to strong selective forces. Site use and migration routes are outcomes of opportunities in the surrounding landscape, and the optimal migration strategy may be conservative or explorative depending on the variability in the environment occupied by the species. This study applies 25 years of resighting data to examine development in winter migration strategy of pink-footed geese divided among Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium, and analyse potential drivers of strategy change as well as individuals' likelihood to break with migratory tradition. Contrary with the general notion that geese are highly traditional in their winter site use, our results reveal that winter migration strategy is highly dynamic in this species, with an average annual probability of changing strategy of 54%. Strategy was not related to hunting pressure or winter temperature, but could be partly explained by a tracking of food resources in a landscape of rapid land use changes. The probability of individuals changing strategy from year to year varied considerably between birds, and was partly related to sex and age, with young males being the most likely to change. The annual probability of changing wintering strategy increased substantially from ≈40% to ≈60% during the study period, indicating an increasingly explorative behaviour. Our findings demonstrate that individual winter strategies are very flexible and able to change over time, suggesting that phenotypic plasticity and cultural transmission are important drivers of strategy choice in this species. Growing benefits from exploratory behaviours, including the ability to track rapid land use changes, may ultimately result in increased resilience to global change.

Fibrous media are functional and versatile materials, as demonstrated by their ubiquity both in natural systems such as feathers and adhesive pads and in engineered systems from nanotextured surfaces to textile products, where they offer benefits in filtration, insulation, wetting and colouring. The elasticity and high aspect ratios of the fibres allow deformation under capillary forces, which cause mechanical damage, matting self-assembly or colour changes, with many industrial and ecological consequences. Attempts to understand these systems have mostly focused on the wetting of rigid fibres or on elastocapillary effects in planar geometries and on a fibre brush withdrawn from an infinite bath. Here we consider the frequently encountered case of a liquid drop deposited on a flexible fibre array and show that flexibility, fibre geometry and drop volume are the crucial parameters that are necessary to understand the various observations referred to above. We identify the conditions required for a drop to remain compact with minimal spreading or to cause a pair of elastic fibres to coalesce. We find that there is a critical volume of liquid, and, hence, a critical drop size, above which this coalescence does not occur. We also identify a drop size that maximizes liquid capture. For both wetting and deformation of the substrates, we present rules that are deduced from the geometric and material properties of the fibres and the volume of the drop. These ideas are applicable to a wide range of fibrous materials, as we illustrate with examples for feathers, beetle tarsi, sprays and microfabricated systems.

A method was developed for the simultaneous determination of anserine, homocarnosine and carnosine in meat samples using ion chromatography (IC) with integrated pulsed amperometric detection (IPAD). The samples were separated on a high performance anion exchange AminoPac PA10 column (250 mm×2 mm) using 100 mmol/L NaOH as the eluent. The flow rate was kept at 0.2 mL/min and the column temperature was set at 30℃. The three target compounds were separated within 15 min, and there were no interferences from 17 tested amino acids in their determination. Under the optimal chromatographic conditions, anserine, homocarnosine and carnosine showed good linearity in the range of 0.05-5 mg/L with correlation coefficients (r) greater than 0.99. The limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantification (LOQs) were in the range of 8.9-22.1 μg/L and 29.6-73.6 μg/L, respectively. The proposed method was applied to the analysis of duck breast and goose breast meat samples. The average spiked recoveries ranged from 92.4% to 104.5%. This simple and sensitive method can be applied to the determination of related nutrients in meat products.

About 150 waterfowl died and another 250 became weak and lethargic from suspected salt poisoning after using White Lake, a highly saline lake in Mountrail County, North Dakota. Frigid temperatures made fresh water unavailable, forcing the birds to ingest the saline waters with resultant toxic effects. Sick birds recovered when removed from the salt water and released into fresh water marshes. Brain sodium levels were higher in dead geese submitted for necropsy than in controls.

Twenty-four Eastern Zhejiang White Geese were slaughtered, dry-cured by 2 different kinds of salt contents (12 geese with 4% low salt level [LS]; 12 geese with 8% high salt level [HS]) for one d, marinated in brine for one d, and air dry-ripened at 16 °C for 7 d. The effect of dry-curing salt contents on the changes in myofibril proteins, potential proteolysis activities, and total free amino acid (TFAA) in dry-cured goose was investigated. Compared to the raw, cathepsin B+L and calpains activities decreased at the end of dry-curing and the third d of dry-ripening. At the final products, the activities of cathepsin B+L and calpains were about half of those in raw meat. There was no difference in proteolysis activities except for the end of dry-curing (P < 0.05) and the 3 d of dry-ripening (P < 0.05) for cathepsin B+L, and the end of dry-curing (P < 0.05) for calpains (P < 0.05) between groups. Myosin light chain (MLC) and troponin-I were cleaved. Compared to the raw, TFAA increased by 36.64 and 31.82% in the final products for HS (P < 0.001) and LS (P < 0.01), respectively. The increase of TFAA could be attributed to the proteolysis of myofibril proteins and retained proteolysis activities. No significant difference on TFAA and MLC and troponin-I bands was observed between groups in final products. This means that different proteolysis activities during processing did not cause the difference in quality of final products between groups, and that 4% low salt can be used in future applications.

In many species, seasonal activities such as reproduction or migration need to be fine-tuned with weather conditions. Air pressure and temperature changes are the best parameters for such conditions. Adapting to climatic changes invariably involves physiological and behavioral reactions associated with the adrenals. In the present study, we investigated the effects of ambient temperature and air pressure on excreted immuno-reactive metabolites of corticosterone (BM) and androgens (AM). Focal individuals were 14 paired male greylag geese (Anser anser) from a semi-tame, unrestrained flock. BM and AM were measured in individual fecal samples over 25 days in November and December. Two different ACTH-validated assays were used for the assessment of BM: the first one cross-reacting with 11beta,21-diol-20-one structures ("old assay") and the second one with 5beta,3alpha,11beta-diol structures ("new assay"). With the "new assay," BM correlated negatively with the minimum ambient temperature of the night before, which may reflect corticosterone involvement in thermoregulation. BM also correlated positively with the minimum air pressure of the previous afternoon, which supports the value of air pressure for predicting weather conditions. Together, these reactions suggest a role of the adrenals in responding behaviorally and physiologically to changes in weather. Preliminary analysis indicated a higher sensitivity to the excreted glucocorticosteroid metabolites in the "new assay." As expected for outside the mating season, no relationships were found between excreted AM and the weather parameters considered. The gradual changes in BM excretion in parallel with weather conditions may be part of the fine-tuning of physiology and behavior by environmental clues.

Dicer plays a key role in the biogenesis of microRNAs and small interfering RNAs, which control the coordinated expression of multiple of genes during follicle development. In this study, the cDNAs encoding two Dicer isoforms (gDicer-a and gDicer-b, respectively) were isolated and cloned from goose ovary using RT-PCR. This is the first time a new Dicer splice variant has been characterized at the molecular level in vertebrates. Sequence analysis indicated that both of the two isoforms consist of seven conserved functional domains, where gDicer-b lacks a linker sequence between DEAD box and helicase C domain composed of 158 amino acids. Each domain of gDicer-a/gDicer-b showed higher than 89.5% identity to corresponding domain of Dicers from chicken, human, and mouse. The ubiquity of transcripts of gDicer-a/gDicer-b was found in all tested tissues by real time PCR with the pituitary, oviduct, and hypothalamus being the predominant site of expression of gDicer-a. A similar expression profile of the gDicer-a/gDicer-b mRNAs was found during follicle development. The abrupt changes in transcripts of gDicer in 2-4mm, 9-10mm, F5, and F1 follicles support its participation in the process of follicle recruitment, selection, dominance, and ovulation. However, high mRNA levels of gDicer-b and caspase-3 were detectable in atretic and post-ovulatory follicles, where expression of gDicer-a was considerably low. These findings suggest that gDicer is required for follicle development, and structural differences in the helicase domain of two gDicer isoforms might contribute to their different roles in controlling granulosa cell apoptosis.

Parasitological investigations carried out on birds in Iceland and France highlight the presence of four species of avian schistosomes from greylag geese (Anser anser L.): the european nasal species Trichobilharzia regenti and three visceral species, among which an unknown species isolated from blood vessels of the large intestine and liver. Morphological and molecular analyzes of different parasite stages (eggs, adults) revealed new species of Trichobilharzia genus – Trichobilharzia anseri sp. nov. Studies on host-parasite relationship under natural conditions, showed that the life-cycle includes the snail Radix balthica (syn. R. peregra) as intermediate host. The cercariae, already isolated in Iceland from two ponds of the Reykjavik capital area – the Family park and Tjörnin Lake – are the same as those isolated in 1999 by Kolářová et al. during the first study on Icelandic parasitic agents of cercarial dermatitis.

Campylobacter jejuni is the most common cause of bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide, with contaminated chicken meat considered to represent a major source of human infection. Biosecurity measures can reduce C. jejuni shedding rates of housed chickens, but the increasing popularity of free-range and organic meat raises the question of whether the welfare benefits of extensive production are compatible with food safety. The widespread assumption that the free-range environment contaminates extensively reared chickens has not been rigorously tested. A year-long survey of 64 free-range broiler flocks reared on two sites in Oxfordshire, UK, combining high-resolution genotyping with behavioural and environmental observations revealed: (i) no evidence of colonization of succeeding flocks by the C. jejuni genotypes shed by preceding flocks, (ii) a high degree of similarity between C. jejuni genotypes from both farm sites, (iii) no association of ranging behaviour with likelihood of Campylobacter shedding, and (iv) higher genetic differentiation between C. jejuni populations from chickens and wild birds on the same farm than between the chicken samples, human disease isolates from the same region and national samples of C. jejuni from chicken meat.

A polyphasic identification approach was used to investigate the taxonomic position of Campylobacter-like isolates recovered from barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) and Canada geese (Branta candensis). Seven strains were selected from a collection of 21 isolates and analyzed by extensive phenotypic testing; four strains were characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The results clearly identified the bird isolates as Helicobacter canadensis, recently described as an emerging human pathogen. This is the first report of an animal reservoir for this organism and of its presence in Europe and confirms the zoonotic potential of H. canadensis.

CD8 molecule is a key marker on T cell surface and is connected with the antigen recognition and activation of T lymphocytes. In order to provide a detection method for quantifying goose CD8α expression, this study raised the protein and antibody for goose CD8α and developed a feasible cell marker enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) method. Recombinant protein of the extracellular region gene of goCD8α was expressed in prokaryotic expression system, and specific polyclonal antibodies for goCD8α were raised and purified, which was further confirmed by Western-blot, immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and immunohistochemistry (IHC). A cell marker ELISA was established and optimized to detect the change of goCD8α expression between goose parvovirus (GPV)-infected and mock-infected goose peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which is consistent with our previously results of real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Cell marker ELISA can provide a new method to detect goCD8α in protein level and in a sensitive, specific, and simple way. This may provide a convenient and novel method for the detection of goCD8α expression.

Two hundred goose broilers originating from farms with different housing facilities were examined for helminth parasites. The farm of the first technological type consisted of halls with deep liter without a run and that of the second type had grass runs neighbouring with a sheet of water. The geese from the first farm harboured A. galli, H. gallinarum and C. obsignata; those from the second farm, D. lanceolata, H. dispar, A. anseris and C. obsignata. In the first case, the geese were infected by helminths from chickens. The incidence and intensity of infection, frequency of single and mixed infections and relation between the incidence and intensity of infection and the age of broilers were evaluated. The influence of breeding technology on the formation of helminth fauna and the significance of individual helminth species in goose breeding are discussed.

A specific Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) has been developed for the identification of goose (Anser anser), mule duck (Anas platyrhynchos x Cairina moschata), chicken (Gallus gallus), turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), and swine (Sus scrofa domesticus) in foie gras. A forward common primer was designed on a conserved DNA sequence in the mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA gene (rRNA), and reverse primers were designed to hybridize on species-specific DNA sequences of each species considered. The different sizes of the species-specific amplicons, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, allowed clear identification of goose, mule duck, chicken, turkey, and swine in foie gras. Analysis of experimental mixtures demonstrated that the detection limit of the assay was approximately 1% for each species analyzed. This genetic marker can be very useful for the accurate identification of these species, avoiding mislabeling or fraudulent species substitution in foie gras.

As part of aetiological studies, we tested 28 samples collected from domestic geese showing enteritis and sporadic death. A novel group of avastroviruses was found in six samples. One isolate was completely sequenced, which comprised 7,148 nucleotides. Pairwise comparisons and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the goose astrovirus is highly divergent from all previously described avastroviruses. Our data support the view that domestic geese can be infected by astroviruses with different genetic backgrounds, and have raised a concern about the role of domestic geese as reservoirs for diverse astroviruses.

A chemiluminescent dot-blot hybridization assay was developed for the detection of Muscovy duck parvovirus (DPV) by using a non-radioactive DPV DNA probe. A 1030bp HindIII-Bg/II fragment of DPV DNA was labelled with digoxigenin-labelled dUTP. The hybridized DPV DNA probes were detected by an immunoenzymatic reaction using anti-digoxigenin-antibody Fab fragments conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and visualized by chemiluminescent reaction. The assay proved to be sensitive since up to 3 fg of homologous DPV DNA and 10(0.4) EID50 mul-1 of DPV infected amino-allantoic fluid could be visualized. It appeared to be specific for the detection of different strains of DPV and Derszy's disease virus (DDV). Nevertheless, the dot-blot assay showed a lower sensitivity to detect DDV infected samples. No hybridization was noticed between DPV DNA probe and the two mammalian parvovirus strains tested (canine and porcine parvoviruses), emphasizing nucleotidic sequence heterologies. The use of the probe for DPV diagnosis purpose is discussed. To our knowledge, this work constitutes the first description of a dot-blot hybridization assay for the detection of an avian parvovirus.

1. The objective of the present study was to determine if the age of semen donors affects the susceptibility of spermatozoa to freezing and whether DMF (dimethyl formamide) inseminated with freeze-thawed gander semen decreases fertility. 2. Semen was collected 3 times a week by dorsal-abdominal massage from two groups of White Italian ganders: 3 and 2 years-old. Both samples were diluted, mixed with DMF to a final concentration of 6% (v/v), pre-frozen and transferred into LN2. 3. Twice a week, the freeze-thawed semen was used for insemination of two groups of geese at a dose of 4 to 16 million live morphologically normal spermatozoa. One group was inseminated immediately after thawing, the 2nd with semen from which the DMF was removed. 4. Donor age had no effect on the spermatozoa's aptitude for freezing. The differences in quality and quantity of fresh and freeze-thawed semen produced by 3 or 2 year-old ganders were not significant. 5. The presence of DMF in the inseminated freeze-thawed semen did not affect the reproductive efficiency of spermatozoa. The fertility rate obtained with semen inseminated either with or without the cryoprotectant averaged 92.9% and 87.2% respectively. The hatchability of set eggs was 81.1% and 79.9% and, the hatchability of fertile eggs amounted to 87.3% and 89.4%.

Since the first isolation from human, astroviruses have been detected in many species. Wide host range and occasional cross-transmission of astrovirus pose a risk for zoonotic infection. Here, novel astroviruses were identified from goslings with recent epidemic gout disease in China. A virus, designated as GD, was efficiently isolated from a diseased gosling using LMH cells. Genome of GD amplified using 5' and 3' RACE was 7183nt in full length. Sequence analysis revealed the genome of GD was <60.8% homology with others deposited in Genbank. Moreover, GD could be neutralized by goose convalescent sera, and the gout associated symptom in goslings could be reproduced by GD infection. Our data demonstrated the goose astrovirus could be one of the causative agents of the ongoing gosling gout disease in China. The identification of the goose astrovirus not only diversified the astrovirus species, but also broadened the disease patterns caused by astroviruses.

Urban populations of Canada geese, Branta canadensis, pose a nuisance problem throughout most of the eastern United States and in other parts of the United States and Canada. Puccinellia arctica is a species of arctic grass that is unpalatable to Canada geese on the North Slope of Alaska and may prove to be an effective long-term and nonlethal means of controlling the growing populations of urban Canada geese. A comparative study of the secondary metabolites of both P. arctica and Puccinellia langeana and Poa pratensis, two palatable grass species that Canada geese generally consume, revealed no significant differences. However, ellagitannin levels were higher in P. arctica than in the palatable grass species and may be contributing to its unpalatability to Canada geese. These results support the potential to use P. arctica in public areas to control geese intrusions.

The lipolytic effect of glucagon was measured in vitro with adipose tissue of "young" (4-8 wk) and "old" (over 1 yr) geese. The response of the young geese tissue was about twice that observed with tissue of old geese, for glucagon concentrations of 0.05, 0.5, and 5.0 mug/ml. Our estimates indicate that the number of adipose cells per g of adipose tissue of young geese was three times that of the old geese tissue. This suggests that the greater lipolytic response to glucagon, observed in young geese adipose tissue, may possibly be due to its greater cellularity, rather than to a greater lipolytic response of the individual adipocyte. The lipolytic effect of glucagon in vivo, for each of the doses between 1.0 and 20.0 mug/kg, was significantly greater in the old than in the young geese. The slope of the linear equation relating log10 of glucagon dose and elevation of plasma FFA 5 min after injection, was significantly greater for the old than for the young geese. In the goose, therefore, the influence of age on the adipokinetic effect of glucagon appears to be mediated by factors operating in the whole animal, more than by changes in the adipose cell itself. A slower removal rate of circulating FFA by the old geese, could be one of these factors.

The objective of our study was to identify Lactobacillus sp. strains of goose origin using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, ITS-PCR and ITS-PCR/RFLP. All three techniques proved to be valuable tools for identification of avian lactobacilli and produced comparable classification results. Lactobacillus strains were isolated from 100% of geese aged 3 weeks to 4 years, but from only 25% of chicks aged 1-10 days. Among the 104 strains isolated, we distinguished 14 Lactobacillus species. The dominant species was Lactobacillus salivarius (35.6%), followed by Lactobacillus johnsonii (18.3%), Lactobacillus ingluviei (11.5%) and Lactobacillus agilis (7.7%). The intact-cell MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry enabled rapid species identification of the lactobacilli with minimal pretreatment. However, it produced more than one identification result for 11.5% examined strains (mainly of the species L. johnsonii). ITS-PCR distinguished 12 genotypes among the isolates, but was not able to differentiate closely related strains, i.e. between Lactobacillus amylovorus and Lactobacillus kitasatonis and between Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus zeae. These species were differentiated by ITS-PCR/RFLP using the restriction enzymes TaqI and MseI. The results obtained indicate that ITS-PCR and ITS-PCR/RFLP assays could be used not only for interspecific, but also for intraspecific, typing.

The structure of goose egg-white lysozyme (GEWL) has been refined to an R-value of 15.9% at 1.6 A resolution. Details of the structure determination, the refinement and the structure itself are presented. The structure of a complex of the enzyme with the trisaccharide of N-acetyl glucosamine has also been determined and refined at 1.6 A resolution. The trisaccharide occupies sites analogous to the B, C and D subsites of chicken (HEWL) and phage T4 (T4L) lysozymes. All three lysozymes (GEWL, HEWL and T4L) display the same characteristic set of bridging hydrogen bonds between backbone atoms of the protein and the 2-acetamido group of the saccharide in subsite C. Glu73 of GEWL is seen to correspond closely to Glu35 of HEWL (and to Glu11 of T4L) and supports the established view that this group is critically involved in the catalytic mechanism. There is, however, no obvious residue in goose lysozyme that is a counterpart of Asp52 of chicken lysozyme (or of Asp20 in T4L), suggesting that a second acidic residue is not essential for the catalytic activity of goose lysozyme, and may not be required for the activity of other lysozymes.

The H5N1 influenza virus, which killed humans and poultry in 1997, was a reassortant that possibly arose in one type of domestic poultry present in the live-poultry markets of Hong Kong. Given that all the precursors of H5N1/97 are still circulating in poultry in southern China, the reassortment event that generated H5N1 could be repeated. Because A/goose/Guangdong/1/96-like (H5N1; Go/Gd) viruses are the proposed donors of the hemagglutinin gene of the H5N1 virus, we investigated the continued circulation, host range, and transmissibility of Go/Gd-like viruses in poultry. The Go/Gd-like viruses caused weight loss and death in some mice inoculated with high virus doses. Transmission of Go/Gd-like H5N1 viruses to geese by contact with infected geese resulted in infection of all birds but limited signs of overt disease. In contrast, oral inoculation with high doses of Go/Gd-like viruses resulted in the deaths of up to 50% of infected geese. Transmission from infected geese to chickens occurred only by fecal contact, whereas transmission to quail occurred by either aerosol or fecal spread. This difference is probably explained by the higher susceptibility of quail to Go/Gd-like virus. The high degree of susceptibility of quail to Go/Gd (H5N1)-like viruses and the continued circulation of H6N1 and H9N2 viruses in quail support the hypothesis that quail were the host of origin of the H5N1/97 virus. The ease of transmission of Go/Gd (H5N1)-like viruses to land-based birds, especially quail, supports the wisdom of separating aquatic and land-based poultry in the markets in Hong Kong and the need for continued surveillance in the field and live-bird markets in which different types of poultry are in contact with one another.

Lead exposure in waterfowl was studied using noninvasive fecal sampling in the Guadalquivir Marshes in Spain, an area affected by the 1998 Aznalcóllar mine disaster. Feces of greylag geese (Anser anser, n = 191) and purple gallinule (Porphyrio porphyrio, n = 91) were collected from three different impacted sites (Entremuros, Caracoles and Cerro de los Ánsares) during the winters of 2004 to 2008. Lead and aluminium (an indicator of sediment ingestion) and Pb isotope signatures (to discriminate between sources of Pb exposure) were analyzed in freeze-dried, acid digested samples. The concentrations of fecal porphyrins and biliverdin were determined as noninvasive biomarkers to study Pb exposure effects. Results showed a decrease in Pb exposure over time in wintering greylag geese. In contrast, for purple gallinule resident in the Entremuros a clear trend was not evident. For both species, sediment ingestion appeared to be the main source of exposure to Pb. In the Entremuros, some samples from purple gallinule were detected with higher Pb levels than expected for simple soil ingestion, and these had Pb isotopic profiles compatible with mining sludge or Pb shot. Whilst fecal Pb isotopic profiles were effective in differentiating between samples from sites with different levels and sources of pollution, the combined use of element ratios (such as Pb/Al) and other non-traditional stable isotope signatures may also prove worthwhile. Overall, the fecal Pb levels detected were below those described in feces for waterfowl from other uncontaminated areas(<10 µg/g d.w.). Despite this, for both species fecal Pb levels were positively correlated with porphyrin excretion, and for purple gallinule, with the coproporphyrin III/I ratio, suggesting some subtle effects on heme synthesis in birds. Ten years after the mine spill, Pb contamination in birds by this pollution source was still detectable and subtlethal effects may persist.

Salt marsh ecosystems are widely considered to be controlled exclusively by bottom-up forces, but there is mounting evidence that human disturbances are triggering consumer control in western Atlantic salt marshes, often with catastrophic consequences. In other marine ecosystems, human disturbances routinely dampen (e.g., coral reefs, sea grass beds) and strengthen (e.g., kelps) consumer control, but current marsh theory predicts little potential interaction between humans and marsh consumers. Thus, human modification of top-down control in salt marshes was not anticipated and was even discounted in current marsh theory, despite loud warnings about the potential for cascading human impacts from work in other marine ecosystems. In spite of recent experiments that have challenged established marsh dogma and demonstrated consumer-driven die-off of salt marsh ecosystems, government agencies and nongovernmental organizations continue to manage marsh die-offs under the old theoretical framework and only consider bottom-up forces as causal agents. This intellectual dependency of many coastal ecologists and managers on system-specific theory (i.e., marsh bottom-up theory) has the potential to have grave repercussions for coastal ecosystem management and conservation in the face of increasing human threats. We stress that marine vascular plant communities (salt marshes, sea grass beds, mangroves) are likely more vulnerable to runaway grazing and consumer-driven collapse than is currently recognized by theory, particularly in low-diversity ecosystems like Atlantic salt marshes.

Feathers are composed of a structure that, whilst being very light, is able to withstand the large aerodynamic forces exerted upon them during flight. To explore the contribution of molecular orientation to feather keratin mechanical properties, we have examined the nanoscopic organisation of the keratin molecules by X-ray diffraction techniques and have confirmed a link between this and the Young's modulus of the feather rachis. Our results indicate that along the rachis length, from calamus to tip, the keratin molecules become more aligned than at the calamus before returning to a state of higher mis-orientation towards the tip of the rachis. We have also confirmed the general trend of increasing Young's modulus with distance along the rachis. Furthermore, we report a distinct difference in the patterns of orientation of beta-keratin in the feathers of flying and flightless birds. The trend for increased modulus along the feathers of volant birds is absent in the flightless ostrich.

The role of Brachyspira bacteria in the aetiology of increased mortality observed in two breeder goose flocks (Flock A consisting of 1,500 and Flock B comprising 4,500 laying geese) at the end of the first egg-laying season, in the period of moulting, was studied. In Flock A 415 geese (28%) died during an 8-week period while in Flock B 834 geese (18%) died during a 12-week period. On gross pathological examination, the geese were found to have haemorrhagic-to-necrotic inflammation of the large intestine (colon and rectum) and fibrinonecrotic typhlitis accompanied by severe degeneration. Often, fibrosis of the kidneys, and in five of the geese secondary visceral urate deposition ("visceral gout") was also observed. Histopathological examination consistently demonstrated spirochaetes in the mucous membrane of the affected large intestine. This was confirmed by the results of immunohistochemical and electron microscopic examination. In addition, Trichomonas stages were also detected from the large intestine of 11 geese. On the basis of their cultural and biochemical properties, and PCR sequencing analysis, eight out of the nine spirochaete strains isolated from the geese by culture on special media under anaerobic conditions were identified as Brachyspira alvinipulli. This is the first report on the isolation of B. alvinipulli from laying geese affected with fibrinonecrotic typhlocolitis.

C-type lectin-like proteins are major components of the calcified eggshell of multiple avian species. In this study, two representative avian C-type lectin-like proteins, ovocleidin-17 and ansocalcin, were purified from decalcified chicken and goose eggshell protein extracts and investigated for carbohydrate binding activity as well as antimicrobial activity. Purified ovocleidin-17 and ansocalcin were found to bind bacterial polysaccharides, and were bactericidal against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomona aeruginosa. Bactericidal activity was found to be enhanced in the presence of calcium but was not dependent on its presence. The results suggest that avian C-type lectin-like proteins may play an important antimicrobial role in defence of the avian embryo.

A study of Blastocystis sp. from domestic birds was undertaken to determine if morphological differences occurred. Fresh faecal material from domestic chickens, ducks and geese and from commercially farmed ostriches was obtained. Blastocystis sp. from chickens was morphologically very different from that from the other hosts, having within the nucleus discrete spots of chromatin rather than a crescentic band (ducks and geese) or an elliptical band (ostrich). A thick surface coat surrounded all Blastocystis sp. cells in the faecal material, with isolates from the ostrich having the thickest surface coat relative to the cell diameter. Cysts were more commonly found in the chicken samples but were also detected in the duck and ostrich samples. This study suggests that three morphologically distinct groups are represented: one in the chicken, one in the ostrich and another in ducks and geese. These tentative conclusions require confirmation by molecular techniques.

We report the findings of a 12-year surveillance study (1977-89) of avian influenza A viruses in eastern Germany. Viruses were isolated directly from feral ducks (n = 236) and other wild birds (n = 89); from domestic ducks (n = 735) living on a single farm; and from white Pekin ducks (n = 193) used as sentinels for populations of wild aquatic birds; mainly sea birds. The efficiency of virus isolation was 9.9% overall, with considerable variability noted among species: 8.7% in wild ducks, 0.9% in other feral birds and 38% in Pekin ducks. Use of sentinel ducks in wild pelagic bird colonies improved virus detection rates fivefold, suggesting that this approach is advantageous in ecological studies. Among the 40 different combinations of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) subtypes we identified, H6N1 predominated (23.6% for all avian species), followed by H4N6 (11%). Among individual species, the frequency profiles favored H2N3 (20.8%) and H4N6 (20.3%) in feral ducks; H7N7 (22.3%), H4N6 (24.4%) and H2N3 (10.4%) in Pekin ducks used as sentinels; and H6N1 (34.8%) and H6N6 (15.1%) in domestic ducks maintained on a single farm. By relying on sentinel birds for serological assays, it was possible to trace an "influenza season" in feral swan populations, beginning in August and continuing through the winter months. Comparison of subtype distribution of influenza viruses for Europe and North America showed significant differences. This supports the fact of two geographically distinct gene pools of influenza viruses in birds connected with their distinct flyways of each hemisphere. The high frequency of isolation of H2 influenza viruses is of considerable interest to those interested in the recycling of this subtype in humans. Similarly the frequent isolation of H7N7 influenza viruses raises concern about reservoirs of potentially pathogenic influenza virus for domestic poultry. Our results confirm the existence of a vast reservoir of influenza A viruses in European aquatic birds, which possesses sufficient diversity to account for strains that infect lower animals and humans.

Goose parvovirus (GPV) is one of the most serious viral pathogens in goslings. Recently, a new pathogen to the Chinese mainland-duck-origin novel goose parvovirus (N-GPV)-was found to be 90.8-94.6% identical to the nucleotide sequence of GPV, and typically causes growth disorders and high infection rates in meat ducks. The spread of both of these viruses hinders the healthy development of the waterfowl breeding industry. In this study, recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) was combined with a vertical flow (VF) visualization strip to develop a universal assay for the rapid detection of GPV and N-GPV. A set of specific primers and probes were designed to target the VP3 gene. Detection was possible at a constant temperature of 37 °C within 5-10 min. The assay successfully detected GPV and N-GPV with high-specificity and did not exhibit cross-reactivity with other waterfowl viruses and bacteria. The analytical sensitivity of the GPV-RPA-VF assay was 2 × 102 copies of GPV plasmid. Validation of the GPV-RPA-VF assay-using 60 samples from the field--confirmed 100% similarity between the results of GPV-RPA-VF and conventional qPCR. The results indicate that the GPV-RPA-VF assay was accurate, sensitive, and specific. This assay can be performed with minimal equipment and training to rapidly detect GPV and N-GPV during the early phase of an outbreak, especially when timely veterinary diagnoses are needed in the field and in rural areas.

Two phenotypes of human influenza A(H1N1) virus are currently circulating in Japan. One (group 1) agglutinates both chicken and goose red blood cells (CRBC and GRBC), the other (group 2) agglutinates GRBC but not CRBC. In the 1995/6 season, group 2 viruses accounted for 70% of the H1N1 viruses isolated in MDCK cells. The 1995/6 viruses were located on two branches of the genetic tree. One branch contained both group 1 and group 2 viruses and the other branch contained only group 2 viruses. Group 2 viruses had aspartic acid at residue 225 in the haemagglutinin (HA) protein, the key amino acid residue for group 2 phenotype. The HA protein of group 1 viruses had a change from aspartic acid to asparagine at residue 225 and the expressed HA protein of these viruses adsorbed CRBC. Serial passage of group 2 viruses in MDCK cells or embryonated chicken eggs caused these viruses to gain the ability to agglutinate CRBC. MDCK-adapted viruses had the same amino acid sequences of HA polypeptide as the original ones, but egg-adapted viruses had changed amino acid sequences. The expressed HA protein from one egg-adapted virus that originally belonged to group 2 adsorbed CRBC.

Peculiarities of geographical distribution and distribution among hosts of the haemosporidian parasites, which cause lethal diseases in poultry, are specified. So far, 11 species of such parasites have been described. This represents about 5% of bird haemosporidian parasites. The haemosporidians cause the lethal epizooties in turkeys, chickens, ducks, geese, pigeons and domesticated ostriches. One species of parasites belongs to the family Haemoproteidae, six--to Plasmodiidae, and four--to Leucocytozoidae. The agents of lethal haemosporidioses have been recorded in domestic birds of the orders Galliformes, Anseriformes, Columbiformes and Struthiorniformes. The majority of these parasites (eight species of 73%) occurs in the galliform birds. Each other order obtaines only one species of parasites. Five species parasitize turkey, which is the main host of the agent of lethal haemosporidioses. The majority of highly virulent haemosporidian species have been recorded throughout a global territory, which includes the Holarctic, Ethiopian and Oriental zoogeorgaphical regions. Three species of these parasites have been found in the Neotropical region, while none species has been recorded in Australia. The majority of highly virulent haemosporidian species have quite clear outlined areas, that is important to know for the prophilactic purposes including the quarantine of bird introducing from endemic territories.

In an outbreak of avian cholera (Pasteurella multocida infection) in wildfowl on and around Chesapeake Bay during March and April of 1978, 31,295 carcasses were retrieved from Maryland and Virginia. Although other birds were involved, mortality was heavy among diving ducks (90% of the total), especially oldsquaw ducks (80% of the total). This is the second outbreak involving primarily diving ducks to be reported from this area of the Atlantic Flyway. It mimics in many respects the epornitic that occurred in 1970. Although mortality was heavy then, this occurrence appears much more severe and could be the largest recorded outbreak of avian cholera in North America.

Using radio-labelled microspheres, the authors studied bone blood flows in various segments of goose femurs (femoral head, trochanter, condyles). Experiments were conducted on three groups of geese: control, fatty liver induced and corticosteroid-treated animals. The preliminary results suggest that hyperlipemia and fatty liver conditions do not seem to obviously disturb intra osseous blood circulation in fatty geese, although corticosteroids might affect bone blood flows in condyles.

Canada geese (Branta canadensis) are numerous, highly visible, and widely distributed in both migratory and resident populations in North America; as a member of the order Anseriformes, they are often suggested as a potential reservoir and source for avian influenza (AI) viruses. To further examine the role of Canada Geese in the ecology of AI, we re-evaluated existing literature related to AI virus in this species and tested breeding populations of Canada Geese from three states (Georgia, West Virginia, and Minnesota, USA) by virus isolation and serology. The ability of AI virus to persist in goose feces under experimental conditions also was evaluated as an additional measure of the potential for this species to serve as an AI virus reservoir. Virus was not isolated from 1,668 cloacal swabs and type-specific antibody prevalence was low (4/335, 1.2%). Finally, under experimental conditions, AI virus persistence in goose feces and in water contaminated with goose feces was limited as compared to published estimates from duck feces and water. Our results are consistent with historic reports of a low prevalence of AI virus infection in this species, and we suggest that Canada Geese play a minor, if any, role as a reservoir for low pathogenic AI viruses that naturally circulate in wild bird populations.

Wetlands are important habitats for migratory birds but have been degraded by many anthropogenic factors including heavy metal contamination. Birds inhabiting wetlands are exposed to pollutants. In this study, a method for exposure risk assessment of migratory herbivorous birds and identification of priority pollutants/areas was developed and employed in East Dongting Lake wetland (EDT). Four heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Pb, and Cd) in sedge and soil samples from ten lesser white-fronted goose (Anser erythropus) habitats in EDT were investigated. Results showed that negative effect of Cr and Pb on lesser white-fronted goose may occur while the concentrations of Cu and Cd are considered to be relatively safe. Prioritize threats were decreased in the following sequence: Cr > Pb > Cu > Cd. Cr and Pb were considered to be the priority pollutants. Spatial interpolation based on geostatistical methods showed that Spring Breeze Lake should draw much attention. Furthermore, regions with high hazard index were identified to be priority areas of EDT for risk management.

The effectiveness of an alpha-chloralose (AC)-corn oil suspension, an AC-margarine mixture, and AC tablets were compared for immobilizing Canada geese (Branta canadensis). Responses to AC immobilization also were compared in male and female Canada geese. There was no difference in mean time to first effects or mean time to capture between male and female geese dosed with 30 mg/kg AC in orally-administered bread baits. Recovery times (< or = 24 hr) also were similar between sexes. Mean (+/-SE) time to first effects for geese immobilized with AC tablets in bread baits (19 +/- 3 min) was significantly less than mean time to first effects for geese immobilized with AC in margarine (28 +/- 6 min) or AC in corn oil (32 +/- 7 min) applied to bread baits (n = 12 geese/treatment). Respective mean times to capture geese immobilized with AC tablets, AC-margarine, and AC-corn oil were not significantly different at 62 +/- 25, 89 +/- 48, and 88 +/- 30 min, respectively. Ten, 11 and, seven geese immobilized with AC tablets, AC-margarine, and AC-corn oil recovered within 24 hr, respectively; all geese recovered within 28 hr. Male and female Canada geese respond similarly to AC immobilization, at least during molt, and AC mixed with margarine or AC in tablet form is at least as effective as the presently used AC-corn oil suspension. AC tablets or AC-margarine also would be more practical for some field situations. Additional development of AC tablets will be required prior to field use for capturing nuisance waterfowl.

1. Spot 14 alpha acts as a transcription factor involved in the regulation of adipogenic enzymes via three thyroid response elements in its promoter region. The objective of the current research was to clone and sequence the Spot 14 alpha gene in geese. 2. We cloned the cDNA sequence of goose Spot 14 alpha. The gene was predicted to encode a peptide of 128 amino acids, which has sequence identities of 87% cDNA and 84% amino acids, with the duck counterparts. High percentages of G and C nucleotides were found in exon and 3' untranslated region of the goose Spot 14 alpha cDNA. 3. A novel frameshift mutation that leads to a damaged leucine zipper motif was observed at nucleotide position 399-400. This can influence the homodimerisation of Spot 14 alpha, probably resulting in dysfunction in the Spot 14 family in vivo. 4. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that goose and duck Spot 14 alpha form a monophyletic group. The Spot 14 alpha mRNA was highly expressed in the liver and adipose tissue of geese. The mRNA concentration and polymorphism of Spot 14 alpha in the lipogenic tissues of geese were related to the fatness trait.

In 1998, we collected blood samples from 63 emperor geese (Chen canagica) on their breeding grounds on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (YKD) in western Alaska, USA. We studied the relationship between selenium concentrations in whole blood and the activities of glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase in plasma. Experimental studies have shown that plasma activities of these enzymes are useful biomarkers of selenium-induced oxidative stress, but little information is available on their relationship to selenium in the blood of wild birds. Adult female emperor geese incubating their eggs in mid-June had a higher mean concentration of selenium in their blood and a greater activity of glutathione peroxidase in their plasma than adult geese or goslings that were sampled during the adult flight feather-molting period in late July and early August. Glutathione peroxidase activity was positively correlated with the concentration of selenium in the blood of emperor geese, and the rate of increase relative to selenium was greater in goslings than in adults. The activity of glutathione reductase was greatest in the plasma of goslings and was greater in molting adults than incubating females but was not significantly correlated with selenium in the blood of adults or goslings. Incubating female emperor geese had high selenium concentrations in their blood, accompanied by increased glutathione peroxidase activity consistent with early oxidative stress. These findings indicate that further study of the effects of selenium exposure, particularly on reproductive success, is warranted in this species.

The genome of an Australian strain of duck hepatitis B virus (AusDHBV) was cloned from a pool of congenitally DHBV-infected-duck serum, fully sequenced and found by phylogenetic analyses to belong to the 'Chinese' DHBV branch of the avian hepadnaviruses. Sequencing of the Pre-S/S gene of four additional AusDHBV clones demonstrated that the original clone (pBL4.8) was representative of the virus present in the pool, and a head-to-tail dimer of the clone was infectious when inoculated into newly hatched ducks. When the published sequences of 20 avian hepadnaviruses were compared, substitutions or deletions in the polymerase (POL) gene were most frequent in the 500 nt segment encoding the 'spacer' domain that overlaps with the Pre-S domain of the Pre-S/S gene in a different reading frame. In contrast, substitutions and deletions were rare within the adjacent segment that encodes the reverse transcriptase domain of the POL protein and the S domain of the envelope protein, presumably because they are more often deleterious.

The results of cytochemical and electron-microscopic examinations show a similarity for age- and season-dependent changes in hormone secretion of the adenohypophysial gonadotropocytes and the arcuate nucleus function of the hypothalamus in geeze. Transition to sexual maturity and the reproductive period are connected with the intensive evacuation of secretory granules from the above-mentioned structures. The period of sexual quietness is characterized by the absence of secretory granules in the neurocytes of the arcuate nucleus and by a slow evacuation of secretion from gonadotropocytes.

Egg production in different goose breeds vary significantly, which is related with the physiology of reproduction. However, the knowledge of physiology of goose reproduction is not well documented. In the present study, the 3 breeds with significantly different egg production were selected to investigate the histological characteristics of follicles and reproductive hormone secretion during follicle development, which included Carlos geese (Anser anser), Zhejiang geese (Anser cygnoides), and Yangzhou geese (Anser cygnoides). The results indicated that there were significant differences in the morphology of ovary and follicles among different goose breeds. The mode of hierarchical follicles in Yangzhou geese was 5, and those were 3 and 4 in Zhejiang and Carlos geese, respectively. The numbers of prehierarchical follicles were 61 to 70, 69 to 75, and 28 to 39 in Yangzhou geese, Zhejiang geese, and Carlos geese, respectively. The thickness of granulosa layer of follicles was higher in the large yellow follicle than those in the other prehierarchical and hierarchical follicles, and Yangzhou geese were the highest among the 3 breeds. The concentration of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) ranged from 12.17 to 28.06 U/L, and 17β-Estradiol ranged from 27.01 to 49.39 pmol/L by the enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay. The level of FSH of Yangzhou geese reached to the highest in the hierarchical follicle (F1), while the other 2 geese did not show the similar feature. In addition, the level of luteinizing hormone (LH) and progesterone (PROG) in the prehierarchical follicles of Yangzhou geese was higher than those in Carlos and Zhejiang geese. In summary, the difference of histological characteristics of follicles and reproductive hormone in different goose breeds was not only reflected in the number of follicles and the thickness of the granulose cell layer, but also embodied the secretion LH and PROG. The more thickness of the granulose cell layer and high secretions of LH and PROG contributed to the development of prehierarchical follicles to hierarchical follicles, which may be due to the fact that Yangzhou geese (Anser cygnoides) has more egg production.

The goose pineal gland rhythmically produces two 5-methoxyindole compounds, namely melatonin and 5-methoxytryptophol. Melatonin concentrations were high at night and low during the day, while in contrast 5-methoxytryptophol levels were markedly higher during the day compared to the night-time values. Rhythmic oscillations in melatonin content, with high night-time values, have also been found in plasma and the retina of goose. The pineal and retinal melatonin rhythm mirrored oscillations in the activity of serotonin N-acetyltransferase (AA-NAT; the penultimate and key regulatory enzyme in the melatonin biosynthetic pathway). Acute exposure of geese to light at night markedly decreased melatonin levels in the pineal, plasma, and retina. In addition, this light exposure resulted in a significant increase in pineal 5-methoxytryptophol content. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, the ability of the goose pineal gland and retina to synthesise melatonin and 5-methoxytryptophol in a rhythmic manner.

Flanders virus (FLAV; family Rhabdoviridae) is a mosquito-borne hapavirus with no known pathology that is frequently isolated during arbovirus surveillance programs. Here, we document the presence of FLAV in Culex tarsalis mosquitoes and a Canada goose (Branta canadensis) collected in western North America, outside of the currently recognized range of FLAV. Until now, FLAV-like viruses detected in the western United States were assumed to be Hart Park virus (HPV, family Rhabdoviridae), a closely related congener. A re-examination of archived viral isolates revealed that FLAV was circulating in California as early as 1963. FLAV also was isolated in Nebraska, Colorado, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Saskatchewan, Canada. Phylogenetic analysis of the U1 pseudogene for 117 taxa and eight nuclear genes for 15 taxa demonstrated no distinct clustering between western FLAV isolates. Assuming the range of FLAV has been expanding west, these results indicate that FLAV likely spread west following multiple invasion events. However, it remains to be determined if the detection of FLAV in western North America is due to expansion or is a result of enhanced arbovirus surveillance or diagnostic techniques. Currently, the impact of FLAV infection remains unknown.

Minidesiccators were attached to the middle and to the blunt and pointed ends of avian eggs of six different species and from their mass change over time the regional shell gas conductance was determined. Later the pore density and shell thickness of these areas were measured. All species showed a decline in regional shell conductance and pore density from the blunt end to the pointed end. With the blunt end over the air cell as a reference point, the regional conductance of the middle and the pointed end declined to 88 and 63%, while pore density fell to 81 and 63%, respectively. The six species represent four orders of birds, and the results suggest that differences in regional conductance may be a relatively common characteristic of bird eggs, that differences in regional pore conductance are proportional to the pore density, and that therefore the conductance of individual pores in any one species is relatively constant.

Three divergent groups of duck astroviruses (DAstVs), namely DAstV-1, DAstV-2 (formerly duck hepatitis virus type 3) and DAstV-3 (isolate CPH), and other avastroviruses are known to infect domestic ducks. To provide more data regarding the molecular epidemiology of astroviruses in domestic ducks, we examined the prevalence of astroviruses in 136 domestic duck samples collected from four different provinces of China. Nineteen goose samples were also included. Using an astrovirus-specific reverse transcription-PCR assay, two groups of astroviruses were detected from our samples. A group of astroviruses detected from Pekin ducks, Shaoxing ducks and Landes geese were highly similar to the newly discovered DAstV-3. More interestingly, a novel group of avastroviruses, which we named DAstV-4, was detected in Pekin ducks. Following full-length sequencing and sequence analysis, the variation between DAstV-4 and other avastroviruses in terms of lengths of genome and internal component was highlighted. Sequence identity and phylogenetic analyses based on the amino acid sequences of the three open reading frames (ORFs) clearly demonstrated that DAstV-4 was highly divergent from all other avastroviruses. Further analyses showed that DAstV-4 shared low levels of genome identities (50-58%) and high levels of mean amino acid genetic distances in the ORF2 sequences (0.520-0.801) with other avastroviruses, suggesting DAstV-4 may represent an additional avastrovirus species although the taxonomic relationship of DAstV-4 to DAstV-3 remains to be resolved. The present works contribute to the understanding of epidemiology, ecology and taxonomy of astroviruses in ducks.

Chicken embryo cells infected with the HEP Flury strain of rabies virus adapted to tissue culture produced a hemadsorption (HAD) phenomenon by using goose erthyrocytes. The optimal conditions for HAD included the incubation of cell cultures at 37C for 3 days after virus inoculation, the use of a 0.4% suspension of goose erythrocytes in phosphate buffer adjusted at pH 6.2, and adsorption of erythrocytes at 4C. This phenomenon was inhibited with anti-rabies serum. Virus titer obtained with the HAD technique was almost the same as with the fluorescent antibody technique or the intracerebral inoculation of suckling mice. Results of the neutralization test by using the HAD technique could be easily determined 3 days after inoculation of chicken embryo cells with the mixture of 100 mean tissue culture infective doses of virus and diluted serum. The neutralizing antibody titers coincided with those obtained in mice.

Water contributes significantly to the binding of small molecules to proteins in biochemical systems. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation based programs such as WaterMap and WATsite have been used to probe the locations and thermodynamic properties of hydration sites at the surface or in the binding site of proteins generating important information for structure-based drug design. However, questions associated with the influence of the simulation protocol on hydration site analysis remain. In this study, we use WATsite to investigate the influence of factors such as simulation length and variations in initial protein conformations on hydration site prediction. We find that 4 ns MD simulation is appropriate to obtain a reliable prediction of the locations and thermodynamic properties of hydration sites. In addition, hydration site prediction can be largely affected by the initial protein conformations used for MD simulations. Here, we provide a first quantification of this effect and further indicate that similar conformations of binding site residues (RMSD < 0.5 Å) are required to obtain consistent hydration site predictions.

A severe epidemic, affecting mainly goose populations, broke out in early January 2015. The causative agents were identified as novel H5 avian influenza viruses carrying N2, N3, and N8 subtypes of the neuraminidase gene. From January 8 to February 11, 766 waterfowl and poultry farms were invaded by the H5 viruses, and more than 2.2 million geese died or were culled. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that these avian influenza viruses derived from the H5 viruses of clade 2.3.4.4 which were emerging in 2014 in East Asia, West Europe, and North America.

Water quality monitoring and microbial risk assessment are important to ensure safe water for drinking, recreational, and agricultural purposes. In this study, we applied a microfluidic quantitative PCR (MFQPCR) approach to simultaneously quantify multiple waterborne pathogens in a natural freshwater lake in Hokkaido, Japan, from April to November, 2012. Tens of thousands of geese stopped over at this lake during their migration in spring and fall. Because lake water is used for irrigation of the surrounding agricultural area, we assessed infection risks through irrigation water usage based on pathogen concentrations directly measured by MFQPCR. We detected various pathogens in the lake water, particularly during the bird migration seasons, suggesting that migratory birds were the main source of the pathogens. However, neither counts of geese nor fecal indicator bacteria were good predictors of pathogen concentrations. On the basis of quantitative microbial risk assessment, concentrations of Campylobacter jejuni and Shigella spp. in water samples were above the concentrations that can potentially cause 10(-4) infections per person per year when water is used to grow fresh vegetables. These results suggest that direct and simultaneous multipathogen quantification can provide more reliable and comprehensive information for risk assessment than the current fecal indicator-based approach.

We have determined amino acid sequences for the alpha-like and beta-like globin components of HbE, one of the two minor hemoglobins in early chick embryos. The complete primary structure of the epsilon chain differs at 18 positions from the adult chicken beta globin, but there are no changes in heme-binding residues, alpha 1 beta 2 contact positions, or allosteric regulatory sites. By amino acid sequence analysis, we have identified a new alpha-like globin that we have called alpha E. The alpha E globin chain differs from the major adult alpha A chain at 22 amino acid positions. This paper discusses the structural and implied functional characteristics of these globins and presents hypotheses regarding the possible role of minor embryonic hemoglobins.

Biological invasions greatly increase the potential for hybridization among native and non-native species. Hybridization may influence the palatability of novel hybrids to consumers potentially influencing invasion success; however, the palatability of non-native hybrids relative to the parent species is poorly known. In contrast, studies of native-only hybrids find they are nearly always more palatable to consumers than the parent species. Here, I experimentally demonstrate that an invasive hybrid cordgrass (Spartina) is dramatically less palatable to grazing geese than the native parent species. Using field and aviary experiments, I show that grazing geese ignore the hybrid cordgrass and preferentially consume native Spartina. I also experimentally demonstrate that reduced herbivory of the invasive hybrid may contribute to faster spread in a California estuary. These results suggest that biological invasions may increase future opportunities for creating novel hybrids that may pose a greater risk to natural systems than the parent species.

During the summers of 2013 and 2014, isolates of a novel Gram-stain-negative coccus in the genus Neisseriawere obtained from the contents of nonviable greater white-fronted goose (Anseralbifrons) eggs on the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska. We used a polyphasic approach to determine whether these isolates represent a novel species. 16S rRNA gene sequences, 23S rRNA gene sequences, and chaperonin 60 gene sequences suggested that these Alaskan isolates are members of a distinct species that is most closely related to Neisseria canis, Neisseriaanimaloris and Neisseriashayeganii. Analysis of the rplF gene additionally showed that the isolates are unique and most closely related to Neisseriaweaveri. Average nucleotide identity of the whole genome sequence of the type strain was between 71.5 and 74.6 % compared to close relatives, further supporting designation as a novel species. Fatty acid methyl ester analysis showed a predominance of C14 : 0, C16 : 0 and C16 : 1ω7c fatty acids. Finally, biochemical characteristics distinguished the isolates from other species of the genus Neisseria. On the basis of these combined data, the isolates are proposed to represent a novel species of the genus Neisseria, with the name Neisseria arctica sp. nov. The type strain is KH1503T (=ATCC TSD-57T=DSM 103136T).

Investigations were carried out on the basic and mineral composition of the liver of slaughtered birds. It was found that the water content of the liver depended on the age and sex, with broilers it being 73.09 g%, with laying hens--72.56 g%, and with cocks--70.62 g%. Proteins had highest percent in the liver of cocks, followed by those in the liver of hens, geese, broilers, and turkeys. The content of fats was highest in the liver of turkey, and in a descending order followed geese, broilers, hens, and cocks. Mineral salts varied from 1.20 to 1.35 g%; highest amounts of sodium were found in the liver of broilers, while highest levels of potassium, calcium, phosphorus, iron, zinc, and copper were established in the liver of turkeys.

An outbreak of Pasteurella anatipestifer infection in young wild waterfowl at the Niska Waterfowl Research Center resulted in losses of approximately 100 Blue and Snow Geese, one White-fronted Goose, five Mandarin Ducks, one Black Duck and one Wood Duck. Clinical signs included diarrhea, paralysis and tremors. Gross lesions were fibrin deposits on serosal surfaces, hemorrhages on the epicardium, consolidation of the lungs, cloudy or flaky deposits on the air sacs, and dark, swollen spleens. Microscopic lesions included fibrinous meningitis, pneumonitis, air saculitis and serositis. Swollen leg and foot joints were seen in some cases. Chloramphenicol treatment seemed to be of benefit in controlling the outbreak.

Since the first outbreak of H5N6 reported in Laos at 2013, there has been a dramatic increase in H5N6 strains isolated from waterfowl in China, particularly Southern China. However, pathogenicity and transmissibility of the virus in different birds remain largely unknown. In this study, a novel H5N6 virus, termed QY01, that belonged to group C in 2.3.4.4 was isolated from an apparently healthy domestic goose in Guangdong province, southern China in 2016. In order to simulate the natural transmission of different kinds of birds, we evaluated its pathogenicity and transmissibility in chickens, domestic geese and pigeons. To investigate the replication and shedding of QY01 in poultry, chickens, geese and pigeons were inoculated intranasally with 106 EID50 of virus. In addition, to measure intra-species transmission of QY01, three sentinel birds were housed with each group. The results demonstrated that QY01 exhibited a highly pathogenic phenotype, and was transmissible among in chickens and geese. However, the virus did not appear to be pathogenic in pigeons, indicating that this novel H5N6 virus exhibited different host ranges and tissue tropisms, and may pose a substantial risk for the chicken and goose industry. Therefore, continued surveillance for H5N6 AIVs is necessary, and increased attention should be paid to cross-species transmission between waterfowl and terrestrial birds.

Chewing lice (Phthiraptera) that parasitize the globally threatened swan goose Anser cygnoides have been long recognized since the early 19th century, but those records were probably biased towards sampling of captive or domestic geese due to the small population size and limited distribution of its wild hosts. To better understand the lice species parasitizing swan geese that are endemic to East Asia, we collected chewing lice from 14 wild geese caught at 3 lakes in northeastern Mongolia. The lice were morphologically identified as 16 Trinoton anserinum (Fabricius, 1805), 11 Ornithobius domesticus Arnold, 2005, and 1 Anaticola anseris (Linnaeus, 1758). These species are known from other geese and swans, but all of them were new to the swan goose. This result also indicates no overlap in lice species between older records and our findings from wild birds. Thus, ectoparasites collected from domestic or captive animals may provide biased information on the occurrence, prevalence, host selection, and host-ectoparasite interactions from those on wild hosts.

A live attenuated virus vaccine is being developed to protect against West Nile virus (WN) disease in humans. Previously, it was found that chimeric West Nile/dengue viruses (WN/DEN4 and WN/DEN4Delta30) bearing the membrane precursor and envelope protein genes of WN on a backbone of dengue type 4 virus (DEN4) with or without a deletion of 30 nucleotides (Delta30) in the 3' noncoding region of the DEN4 part of the chimeric genome were attenuated and efficacious in mice and monkeys against WN challenge. Here, we report the generation of a clinical lot of WN/DEN4Delta30 virus and its further preclinical evaluation for safety and immunogenicity in mice, geese and monkeys. The vaccine candidate had lost neuroinvasiveness in highly sensitive immunodeficient mice inoculated intraperitoneally and had greatly reduced neurovirulence in suckling mice inoculated intracerebrally (IC). Compared to the wild-type WN parent, the chimeric virus was highly restricted in replication in both murine and human neuroblastoma cells as well as in brains of suckling mice. The WN/DEN4Delta30 virus failed to infect geese, indicating that chimerization of WN with DEN4 completely attenuated WN for this avian host. This observation suggests that the WN/DEN4 chimeric viruses would be restricted in their ability to be transmitted from vaccinees to domestic or wild birds. In monkeys, the WN/DEN4Delta30 vaccine candidate was highly immunogenic despite its low level of replication with undetectable viremia. Furthermore, the WN/DEN4Delta30 vaccine virus was safe and readily induced neutralizing antibodies against WN in monkeys immune to each of the four serotypes of dengue virus. These studies confirm the attenuation of WN/DEN4Delta30 for non-human primates, including dengue-immune monkeys, and demonstrate both a highly restricted replication (>10(8)-fold decrease) in the brain of mice inoculated IC and an absence of infectivity for birds, findings that indicate this vaccine should be safe for both the recipient and the environment.

Studies have shown linoleate could not only promote cell viability but also affect lipid metabolism in mammals. However, to what degree these effects are mediated by steatosis in goose primary hepatocytes is unknown. In this study, the effect of linoleate on the lipid metabolic homeostasis pathway was determined. We measured the mRNA levels of genes involved in triglyceride synthesis, lipid deposition, β-oxidation, and assembly and secretion of VLDL-TGs in goose (Anser cygnoides) primary hepatocytes. Linoleate significantly increased goose hepatocyte viability, and linoleate at 0.125 mM, 0.25 mM, 0.5 mM and 1.0 mM all showed a significant effect on TG accumulation. However, with increasing linoleate concentrations, the extracellular TG concentration and extracellular VLDL gradually decreased. DGAT1, DGAT2, PPARα, PPARγ, FoxO1, MTP, PLIN and CPT-1 mRNA was detected by real-time PCR. With increasing linoleate concentrations, the changes in DGAT1, DGAT2, PPARα and CPT-1 gene expression, which regulates hepatic TG synthesis and fatty acid oxidation, first increased and then decreased. Additionally, FoxO1 and MTP gene expression was reduced with increasing linoleate concentrations, and the change in PLIN gene expression was increased at all concentrations, similar to the regulation of intracellular TG accumulation. In conclusion, linoleate regulated TG accumulation and increased hepatocyte viability. The data suggest that linoleate does promote goose hepatocyte viability and steatosis, which may up-regulate TG synthesis-relevant gene expression, suppress assembly and secretion of VLDL-TGs, and increase fatty acid oxidation properly to function of goose primary hepatocytes.

A total of 200 healthy 28-day-old male Jiangnan White geese were used to investigate the free radical scavenging ability, reduced glutathione (GSH) and thioredoxin systems, and the concentrations of reactive oxygen metabolites (ROM), malondialdehyde (MDA), and protein carbonyl (PC) in geese fed diets with organic selenium (Se) (Selenomethionine, SeMet) and inorganic Se (sodium selenite, SS). All geese were randomly allotted into 4 groups with 5 replicates of 10 geese each, and received basal diet supplemented with 0.3 mg Se/kg SS, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 mg Se/kg SeMet until 70 D of age, respectively. Geese in the SS and SeMet groups exhibited similar growth performance. Diet with SeMet increased the scavenging abilities of 2,2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt free radical (ABTS•+, P < 0.001) and superoxide radical (O2-•, P = 0.002) in the serum of geese, as well as the scavenging abilities of ABTS•+ (P = 0.023), hydroxyl radical (P = 0.009) and O2-• (P = 0.019) in the liver of geese. Compared to the SS group, SeMet increased hepatic GSH concentration (P = 0.002), the activities of glutathione peroxidase (P = 0.031), γ-glutamate cysteine ligase (P < 0.001), and thioredoxin reductase (P < 0.001), and decreased the concentrations of ROM, MDA, and PC in the serum and liver of geese (P < 0.05). In conclusion, dietary SeMet inclusion would be more effective than SS in increasing the antioxidant capacity of geese, possibly by improving GSH and thioredoxin systems, and 0.2 mg Se/kg SeMet in goose diet is recommended.

We present a historical account of the story behind the famous hawk/goose experiments of Lorenz and Tinbergen in a wider context of cognitive ethology. We discuss their significance, for ethological experimentation in general, and specifically for understanding innate constraints on cognition. As examples of the continuing significance of the hawk/goose paradigm of selective habituation, we discuss its relation to "exposure therapy" of human phobias and the use of hawk silhouettes as deterrents for songbirds. Finally we rephrase Uexküll's thesis of taxon-specific worlds ("Umwelten") as a "Theory of World."

Canada geese (Branta canadensis) faeces have been shown to contain pathogenic protozoa and bacteria in numerous studies over the past 15 years. Further, increases in both the Canada geese populations and their ideal habitat requirements in the United States (US) translate to a greater presence of these human pathogens in public areas, such as recreational freshwater beaches. Combining these factors, the potential health risk posed by Canada geese faeces at freshwater beaches presents an emerging public health issue that warrants further study. Here, literature concerning human pathogens in Canada geese faeces is reviewed and the potential impacts these pathogens may have on human health are discussed. Pathogens of potential concern include Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella Typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, Helicobacter canadensis, Arcobacter spp., Enterohemorragic Escherichia coli pathogenic strains, Chlamydia psitacci, Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia lamblia. Scenarios presenting potential exposure to pathogens eluted from faeces include bathers swimming in lakes, children playing with wet and dry sand impacted by geese droppings and other common recreational activities associated with public beaches. Recent recreational water-associated disease outbreaks in the US support the plausibility for some of these pathogens, including Cryptosporidium spp. and C. jejuni, to cause human illness in this setting. In view of these findings and the uncertainties associated with the real health risk posed by Canada geese faecal pathogens to users of freshwater lakes, it is recommended that beach managers use microbial source tracking and conduct a quantitative microbial risk assessment to analyse the local impact of Canada geese on microbial water quality during their decision-making process in beach and watershed management.

Here, for the first time, to colocalize new type gosling viral enteritis virus (NGVEV) with histological lesions and in situ apoptosis in the digestive organs (esophagus, proventriculus, gizzard, small intestine, cecum, rectum, liver, and pancreas) and the lymphoid organs (bursa of Fabricius, thymus, Harderian gland, and spleen) of experimentally infected goslings, portions of tissues were collected at sequential infection time points and examined by histopathology for histological lesions, immunohistochemical staining for viral antigens, ultrastructural observation by transmission electron microscope (TEM) for virus particles and apoptotic cells, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling assay for in situ apoptosis. The hyperemia, hemorrhage, infiltration of lymphocytes, progressive lymphoid depletion, apoptosis, and necrosis were readily observed in the lymphoid organs and intestine tract by histopathological examination. The NGVEV particles and viral antigens widely appeared in the small intestine and bursa of Fabricius as early as 2 d postinfection (PI) by TEM and immunohistochemical staining, and the presence and quantity of it reached a maximum during 6 to 12 d PI. The principal sites for NGVEV were endothelial cells, epithelia, mucosal cells, glandular cells, fibrocytes, macrophages, and lymphocytes. A series of apoptotic morphological changes including chromatin condensation and margination, cytoplasmic shrinkage, and formation of apoptotic body were observed by TEM, and the number of apoptotic cells was largely increased from 4 d PI and peaked at 9 d PI by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling analysis. The histological organ lesions and apoptosis in vivo were generally associated with sites of NGVEV localization, which can be regarded as the cause of death. This work may shed light on the pathogenesis of new type gosling viral enteritis and put new insight into the pathogenesis of goose adenovirus.

The goals of this study were to (i) identify issues that affect the ability of discriminant function analysis (DA) of antimicrobial resistance profiles to differentiate sources of fecal contamination, (ii) test the accuracy of DA from a known-source library of fecal Escherichia coli isolates with isolates from environmental samples, and (iii) apply this DA to classify E. coli from surface water. A repeated cross-sectional study was used to collect fecal and environmental samples from Michigan livestock, wild geese, and surface water for bacterial isolation, identification, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing using disk diffusion for 12 agents chosen for their importance in treating E. coli infections or for their use as animal feed additives. Nonparametric DA was used to classify E. coli by source species individually and by groups according to antimicrobial exposure. A modified backwards model-building approach was applied to create the best decision rules for isolate differentiation with the smallest number of antimicrobial agents. Decision rules were generated from fecal isolates and applied to environmental isolates to determine the effectiveness of DA for identifying sources of contamination. Principal component analysis was applied to describe differences in resistance patterns between species groups. The average rate of correct classification by DA was improved by reducing the numbers of species classifications and antimicrobial agents. DA was able to correctly classify environmental isolates when fewer than four classifications were used. Water sample isolates were classified by livestock type. An evaluation of the performance of DA must take into consideration relative contributions of random chance and the true discriminatory power of the decision rules.

Freshly excreted Canada goose faeces pose a public health risk as they contain pathogenic microorganisms. Accordingly, a study was carried out on the growth and survival of resident indicator bacteria (enterococci and Escherichia coli) and inoculated Campylobacter jejuni in freshly excreted faeces over summer and winter. Canada goose faeces were collected, mixed thoroughly and inoculated with 10⁸ g⁻¹ C. jejuni. The faeces were mixed again before making the Canada goose dropping. The simulated goose droppings (N = 70) were placed on pasture, and the concentrations of E. coli, enterococci and the pathogen, C. jejuni, were monitored. In summer only, the molecular marker of E. coli LacZ and the avian-associated bacteria E2 was also monitored. Results of the survival study indicated that significant growth of enterococci and E. coli occurred in summer, before concentrations decreased to less than 15% of the original concentration (day 77) for enterococci and 0.01% for E. coli. LacZ followed a similar pattern to E. coli, while the E2 marker dropped to below 0.1% of the original concentration within 4 days. In winter, enterococci grew slightly, while no growth of E. coli occurred. In both summer and winter, C. jejuni was rapidly inactivated. This research highlights the ability of bacterial indicators to replicate and survive in the environment when harboured by avian faeces, and the limited risk aged Canada goose faeces pose as an environmental source of Campylobacter spp.

The semen quality factor (SQF) takes into account 3 semen parameters as a means of predicting semen fertilizing ability: semen volume, semen concentration, and the percentage of live and morphologically normal spermatozoa. The objective of this study was to test the suitability of the SQF as an indicator of fertility for geese. Twenty-one ganders were divided into 3 groups based on their individual SQF values, and semen was pooled within each group. A fourth semen group was generated by diluting semen from the highest SQF group with 2 vol of diluent. Pooled semen was inseminated into 30 geese per treatment. Relationships between SQF and fertility were evaluated. Testosterone and estradiol levels in seminal plasma were determined by competitive immunoassays. The SQF values of the 4 diluted semen groups were 19.3, 11.3, 9.5, and 13.1, and the corresponding fertility values, determined by candling, were 83.9, 65.6, 56.8, and 74.3%, respectively. The correlation coefficient between SQF and fertility was 0.985 (P < 0.01), indicating that the SQF can be used as a good indicator of fertility for geese. The SQF values correlated well with the ratio of testosterone to estradiol in seminal plasma (r = 0.48, P < 0.05), which could also be a diagnostic tool for evaluating the reproductive potential of individual ganders.

This article discusses Bowlby's development of an ethological-evolutionary perspective, and its implications for psychotherapy with adults. According to Bowlby, attachment behavior is instinctive, having emerged throughout the course of evolution to ensure protection and actual survival. Because the environment affects how attachment behavior unfolds, adverse experiences can divert developmental pathways away from resilience, toward dysfunction and emotional distress. Psychotherapy offers the experience of an attachment relationship. Part of the process involves helping patients understand that feelings such as fear and anxiety are inherent responses to safeguard affectional relationships when they are endangered. As working models are re-appraised and revised, there is emphasis on clarifying the attachment experiences that may have intensified these natural feelings.

We investigated experimental transmission of duck hepatitis B virus to its original host, the domestic Pekin duck, and to three other avian species. Intramuscular injection of a standard inoculum of duck hepatitis B virus into 2- to 5-day-old Pekin ducklings hatched from a duck hepatitis B virus-free flock resulted in viremia in 100% of 107 animals, indicating that duck hepatitis B virus infection of young progeny of a defined duck hepatitis B virus-free flock occurs reproducibly. When the same inoculum was injected into chicks and Muscovy ducklings of the same age, no evidence of viral infection was detectable. In contrast, hatchlings of two domestic breeds of geese were readily infected by duck hepatitis B virus, developing viremia at a slower rate than Pekin ducklings, but a higher average titer of viremia 4 weeks or more after injection. Neither the pattern of restriction enzyme sites in the viral DNA nor the susceptibility of ducklings to the virus were detectably altered after passage in geese. As in duck hepatitis B virus-infected young ducklings, most of the experimentally infected goslings appeared to be persistently infected and those eventually laying eggs transmitted virus to the progeny. While ducklings exhibited a fairly uniform inflammatory response to the virus, duck hepatitis B virus inoculation of the goslings resulted in both inflammation and an altered hepatocellular morphology not seen in uninjected controls. The host range of duck hepatitis B virus appears to be limited to the primary host and a close taxonomic relative, similar to other members of the hepadnavirus family, hepatitis B virus and ground squirrel hepatitis virus.

Bird species show a high degree of variation in the composition of their preen gland waxes. For instance, galliform birds like chicken contain fatty acid esters of 2,3-alkanediols, while Anseriformes like goose or Strigiformes like barn owl contain wax monoesters in their preen gland secretions. The final biosynthetic step is catalyzed by wax synthases (WS) which have been identified in pro- and eukaryotic organisms.

The recent epizootic of West Nile fever in Israel affected predominantly young domestic geese between three and eight weeks old. Clinically, the birds presented paralytic signs while morbidity and mortality were severe in affected flocks. The condition was encountered from early September through late November on goose farms located throughout the country. Losses incurred by goose flocks were sufficiently great as to warrant investigation of ways to protect young geese against the neurological form of the disease. We have conducted a series of vaccination trials in which three-week old geese were immunized with an attenuated, commercial flavivirus vaccine derived from Israel turkey meningoencephalitis virus (TME). Birds were challenged two weeks later with a low Vero cell passage of West Nile virus by the intracerebral route. In a second group of experiments, inactivated and live TME vaccines were given in tandem at an interval of two weeks and challenged two weeks later. The third vaccination trial was based on West Nile virus (WNV) harvested from infant mouse brain, inactivated with formalin and oil adjuvanted. A single injection given either subcutaneously or intramuscularly resulted in 75% protection of the vaccinated groups, while two injections spaced two weeks apart resulted in 94% protection. Groups of geese, vaccinated at the farms and challenged under controlled conditions in the laboratory, showed levels of protection ranging from 39% to 72% for TME vaccine and 52% and 80% for WNV vaccine. The lower levels of protection are attributable to flocks being affected with intercurrent infections at the time of vaccination.

Lead and zinc poisoning have been recorded in a variety of bird species, including migrating waterfowl such as Canada Geese (Branta canadensis), at sites contaminated with mine waste from lead and zinc mines in the Tri-State Mining District, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri, USA. The adverse health impacts from mine waste on these birds may, however, be more extensive than is apparent from incidental reports of clinical disease. To characterize health impacts from mine waste on Canada Geese that do not have observable signs of poisoning, four to eight apparently healthy birds per site were collected from four contaminated sites and an uncontaminated reference site, and examined for physical and physiologic evidence of metals poisoning. Tissue concentrations of silver, aluminum, arsenic, barium, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, lead, selenium, thallium, vanadium, and zinc were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. Adverse health effects due to lead were characterized by assessing blood δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) enzyme activity. Adverse effects associated with zinc poisoning were determined from histologic examination of pancreas tissues. Elevated tissue lead concentrations and inhibited blood ALAD enzyme activities were consistently found in birds at all contaminated sites. Histopathologic signs of zinc poisoning, including fibrosis and vacuolization, were associated with elevated pancreatic zinc concentrations at one of the study sites. Adverse health effects associated with other analyzed elements, or tissue concentrations indicating potentially toxic exposure levels to these elements, were not observed.

A common form of evolutionary variation between vertebrate taxa is the different numbers of segments that contribute to various regions of the anterior-posterior axis; cervical vertebrae, thoracic vertebrae, etc. The term 'transposition' is used to describe this phenomenon. Genetic experiments with homeotic genes in mice have demonstrated that Hox genes are in part responsible for the specification of segmental identity along the anterior-posterior axis, and it has been proposed that an axial Hox code determines the morphology of individual vertebrae (Kessel, M. and Gruss, P. (1990) Science 249, 347-379). This paper presents a comparative study of the developmental patterns of homeobox gene expression and developmental morphology between animals that have homologous regulatory genes but different morphologies. The axial expression boundaries of 23 Hox genes were examined in the paraxial mesoderm of chick, and 16 in mouse embryos by in situ hybridization and immunolocalization techniques. Hox gene anterior expression boundaries were found to be transposed in concert with morphological boundaries. This data contributes a mechanistic level to the assumed homology of these regions in vertebrates. The recognition of mechanistic homology supports the historical homology of basic patterning mechanisms between all organisms that share these genes.

A severe infectious disease characterized with gout, haemorrhage and swellings of kidneys has affected goslings around the major goose-producing regions in China since November 2016. A Novel goose-origin astrovirus (AStV), designated as AStV/SDPY/Goose/1116/17 (AStV-SDPY) strain, was isolated from diseased goslings, and experimental reproduction of gout was successful using the AStV-SDPY strain. Additionally, the AStV-SDPY was conducted for its full genome sequencing characterization using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technique on Illumina HiSeq platform. A complete genome of the AStV-SDPY was 7,252 nt in length and encoded three viral proteins. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that AStV-SDPY strain belongs to an independent branch of avian astroviruses, and the nucleotide homology among AStV-SDPY and other classic avian astrovirus strains was only 48.8%-68.2%. Results of above data indicated the causative agent of the gosling gout occurring in China is a novel divergent goose astrovirus.

Despite the chicken being one of the most genetically mapped of all animals, its karyotype remains poorly defined. This is primarily due to microchromosomes that belie assignment by conventional methods. To address this problem, we have developed chromosome-specific paints using flow cytometry and microdissection. For the microchromosomes it was necessary to amplify and label DNA from single microdissected chromosomes.

Geese and ducks were photosensitized by the ingestion of Ammi majus seeds, and exposure to sunlight. Mydriasis was a characteristic clinical feature of this syndrome in both species. Histologically the iris of the affected birds showed vacuolisation and varying degrees of atrophy of the muscle of the sphincter pupillae. The effect of pilocarpine and physostigmine on the normal and mydriatic eyes was studied. The possible mode of action of photosensitization and the significance of these findings in the light of the use of psoralens in human medicine is discussed.

According to condemnation lists collected from 6 poultry slaughterhouses in northern Jutland there has been an increase in condemnation rate for broilers from 0.8 to 1.0% (Table I). The most important causes of condemnation have been emaciation, CRD, hock disorder and enteritis (Table II). Only a few slaughterhouses were involved in processing of hens, turkeys and web-footed birds showing inconstant distributions (Tables III and IV). Variation among slaughterhouses appears from Tables II-IV. The cause of variation and the value of central disease recording are discussed.

The synaptonemal complex (SC) is a protein structure which binds two homologues during prophase of the first meiotic division and assures the correct course of genetic recombination. The demonstration and identification of SCs in European domestic goose Anser anser was the aim of the current research. Standard techniques of SC identification do not allow for an analysis of their molecular structure. In meiotic cells of one-day-old nestlings and 17-week-old geese the haploid number of bivalents, darkly stained kinetochores and subtelomeric regions may be evidence for the presence of SCs. Experimental chromosome staining with the DAPI fluorochrome permitted the observation of the characteristic ladder-like structure of SCs and the course of synapsis formation within homologues from early leptotene to their degradation in late pachytene. The detailed molecular structure of synaptonemal complexes can be analysed with an electron or scanning microscope only. Because the bivalent is a direct result of the complex's presence, in the literature the presence of bivalents is equivalent to the term "synaptonemal complex". However, the bivalent and the SC are two different structures.

Using Jamin-Lebedeff interference microscopy, we measured the wavelength dependence of the refractive index of butterfly wing scales and bird feathers. The refractive index values of the glass scales of the butterfly Graphium sarpedon are, at wavelengths 400, 500 and 600 nm, 1.572, 1.552 and 1.541, and those of the feather barbules of the white goose Anas anas domestica are 1.569, 1.556 and 1.548, respectively. The dispersion spectra of the chitin in the butterfly scales and the keratin in the bird barbules are well described by the Cauchy equation n(λ) = A + B/λ(2), with A = 1.517 and B = 8.80·10(3) nm(2) for the butterfly chitin and A = 1.532 and B = 5.89·10(3) nm(2) for the bird keratin.

Gizzards from 64 hunter-shot Canada geese (Branta canadensis) were collected in southern Illinois (USA) in December 1991 and January 1992 to determine the prevalence and intensity of gizzard nematodes. Three species of gizzard nematodes were recovered: Amidostomum anseris, Amidostomum spatulatum, and Epomidiostomum crami. The prevalence of infection was 98%. Mean intensity was 17.8 nematodes per host and was significantly greater for immature geese (40.3 nematodes/host) than for adult geese (10.9 nematodes/host). The intensity of both A. anseris and E. crami was greater in immature geese, but even the most heavily infected birds did not display serious lesions. Despite a dramatic increase in the population of geese, mean intensity in adult geese was similar to mean intensity reported from earlier studies at the same site. Mean intensity in immature geese in 1991 and 1992 was greater than in earlier studies.

In goose salt gland slices incubated in bicarbonate-buffered medium which contained 170 mEq of Na(+)/liter, net total tissue Na(+), expressed as milliequivalents per kilogram, was, in the presence of either acetylcholine (plus eserine) or ouabain, significantly higher than that of the bathing fluid. Acetylcholine caused an increase in the tissue Na(+) content as compared with untreated slices; there was an approximately equivalent decrease in K(+) and a significant decrease in Cl(-). The calculated net intracellular concentrations of Na(+), expressed as milliequivalents per liter of intracellular water, in unstimulated, acetylcholine-stimulated, and ouabain-treated slices were 2.1, 3.1, and 2.7 times higher, respectively, than the concentration of Na(+) in the bathing fluid. The net intracellular concentration of Na(+), expressed as milliequivalents per liter of intracellular water, in slices incubated in the presence of acetylcholine was 531 mEq/liter; this is approximately the same as the concentration of Na(+) in the secreted fluid of the goose salt gland (515 mEq/liter). The results indicate that the main concentration gradient for Na(+) could be established across the basal membrane. The data do not indicate whether this involves active transport of Na(+) per se. A second stage which might involve Na-K ATPase activity at the luminal membrane is discussed. The sum of the total tissue Na(+) and K(+) was approximately 250 mEq/kg, whereas the Cl(-) content was only approximately 130 mEq/kg.

Newcastle disease virus (NDV) has only a single serotype but diversified genotypes. Genotype VII strains are the prevalent currently circulating genotype worldwide, and in particular, these strains cause outbreaks in waterfowl. In this study, a reverse genetics system for highly virulent NDV isolated from goose flocks was developed independent of conventional T7 RNA polymerase. Infectious virus was successfully generated by an RNA polymerase II promoter to drive transcription of the full-length virus antigenome. A green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing virus was generated by inserting an additional transcription cassette coding for the enhanced GFP between the P and M genes of the genome. The expression of GFP was confirmed by western blotting and fluorescence microscopy. The replication kinetics and pathogenicity of the recombinant viruses are indistinguishable from the parental wild-type virus. This reverse genetics system will provide a powerful tool for the analysis of goose-origin NDV dissemination and pathogenesis, as well as preparation for genotype-matched NDV attenuated vaccines.

A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and dot blot hybridization (DBH) test have been developed for the diagnosis of infection by a novel circovirus of geese (GoCV). These tests were applied to samples of bursae of Fabricius from sick and dead birds from commercial goose farms in Hungary. In this second report of the occurrence of circovirus infection in diseased geese, 103 of 214 (48.1%) and 37 of 150 (24.6%) birds, and 49 of 76 (64.5%) and 18 of 76 (23.7%) flocks were positive by PCR and DBH respectively. The sensitivity of the PCR test was such that 0.10 fg of virus DNA was detectable. The DBH test was less sensitive, only detecting larger amounts (40 pg) of DNA, but was used as a semi-quantitative method for detecting the presence of virus. The incidence of infection was affected by factors such as the age of the birds and rearing methods.

Peculiarities of antioxidant homeostasis of geese brain tissue during embryogenesis and early postnatal period have been studied. It has been shown that the cerebrum and hindbrain tissues are characterized by a higher level of lipid peroxidation compared to liver. Main antioxidative enzymes' activity (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase) in the brain already reaches its maximum in the middle period of embryogenesis. We have found that brain tissues are characterized by a lower activity of intracellular enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase) but increased glutathione peroxidase activity as compared to liver. The rate of Fe2+ initialized lipid peroxidation and coefficient of antioxidative activity were used as a criterion for evaluation of antioxidative system's status. According to the dynamics of these factors the highest tension of antioxidative system in the brain appears in the period of the contour (28 days) and juvenile (49 days) feather formation.

Dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH) is a critical enzyme in the biosynthesis of catecholamines. This enzyme's role in neuroendocrine regulation is well known, but there are some indications that it may also modulate reproduction and endocrine in mammals and birds. We selected goose (Anas cygnoides) as an ideal model species for investigating the role of DBH in avian reproduction.

In mammals, Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is an important membrane-bound receptor triggered by antiviral compounds and single-stranded RNA. It is implicated in the immune response to viruses such as influenza virus. It was not known whether geese, a natural host for avian influenza viruses, possess a homologue of mammalian TLR7 for recognizing avian influenza virus. In this study, we cloned the full-length of goose TLR7 and partial sequences of its adaptor protein, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), some antiviral molecules such as RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS). Goose TLR7 has a protein secondary structure identical to that of mammals, consisting of several leucine-rich domains, a transmembrane domain, and Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain. To further understand whether the MyD88-dependent pathway of TLR7 is involved in the antiviral innate immune response against highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) infection in geese, we inoculated geese with an H5N1 HPAIV isolated from ducks in 2004. The virus, A/Duck/Guangdong/212/2004, replicated in various tissues resulting in 40% mortality. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed upregulation of mRNA transcripts for TLR7, MyD88, PKR and OAS in the lungs of geese at 1, 2 and 3 days post-inoculation. Therefore, the MyD88-dependent pathway of TLR7 was involved in the early stage of antiviral innate immune response in geese during H5N1 HPAIV infection.

Day-old chicks were susceptible to pigeon herpes encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) by intracerebral (i/c) inoculation. Infected birds developed neurologic signs starting from 2 to 15 days post-infection, and 85% died. The virus was recovered from the brains of diseased chicks in titers ranging between 104 and 105.5 EID 50/0.2 ml. Inoculated birds shed the virus in their droppings throughout the 2 weeks observation period. Day-old chicks given the virus by the intranasal (i/n) or oral routes did not develop any specific signs but shed the virus also in their droppings throughout the observation period. Ducklings and goslings inoculated intravenously (i/v), i/n or orally were resistant. Day-old chicks and ducklings, goslings and quails inoculated by different routes with pigeon herpesvirus (PHV) did not show respiratory or nervous signs.

A research-and-economic experiment was carried out with a total of 8,621 geese of local breeds of 3.964 kg average body mass, fattened forcedly with steamed grain maize in the course of 20-30 days. The dynamic of a number of qualities was followed up with special emphasis on the live weight from the beginning to the end of the fattening period, the weight gain, the mass and quality of liver, and the intake of feed per kg of gain and per kg of liver mass. Determined was also the nutritive value of proteins contained in the liver as judged by the index of the amino acid ratio (tryptophan to hydroxyproline). It was found that local geese could be characterized by good fattening capacity, yielding high-quality liver of excellent organoleptic indices and high nutritive value at a comparatively low intake of feed.

Formal nomenclature is proposed for five methanogens, isolated from horse, pig, cow, goose and sheep faeces, that represent four novel species of the genus Methanobrevibacter. The four species, Methanobrevibacter gottschalkii sp. nov., Methanobrevibacter thaueri sp. nov., Methanobrevibacter woesei sp. nov. and Methanobrevibacter wolinii sp. nov., are distinguished from each other by a lack of genomic DNA reassociation and from previously described members of the genus on the basis of differences in the sequences of the 16S rRNA genes.

The role of wild birds in the epidemiology of the Asian lineage highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus subtype H5N1 epizootic and their contribution to the spread of the responsible viruses in Eurasia and Africa are unclear. To better understand the potential role of swans and geese in the epidemiology of this virus, we infected 4 species of swans and 2 species of geese with an HPAI virus of Asian lineage recovered from a whooper swan in Mongolia in 2005, A/whooper swan/Mongolia/244/2005 (H5N1). The highest mortality rates were observed in swans, and species-related differences in clinical illness and viral shedding were evident. These results suggest that the potential for HPAI (H5N1) viral shedding and the movement of infected birds may be species-dependent and can help explain observed deaths associated with HPAI (H5N1) infection in anseriforms in Eurasia.

The pathobiology of H5N1 high-pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) virus infection in wild waterfowl is poorly understood. This study examined the pathobiology of A/chicken/Korea/IS/06 (H5N1) HPAI in 5 migratory waterfowl species--mute swans (Cygnus olor), greylag geese (Anser anser), ruddy shelducks (Tadorna ferruginea), mandarin ducks (Aix galericulata), and mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos)--following intranasal inoculation or contact exposure, from which all birds became infected. In mute swans, this virus had strong vascular endothelial cell tropism, producing acute severe disease and 100% mortality; the virus was detected in various parenchymal cells; and necrotic and inflammatory changes were noted in a range of organs, including pancreas, brain, spleen, heart, oral cavity, adrenal gland, lung, and liver. The ruddy shelducks had 100% mortality, but time to death was delayed, and the lesions were primarily restricted to the brain, heart, pancreas, and spleen. The mandarin ducks had only a single mortality, with lesions similar to those in ruddy shelducks. The greylag geese became infected, developed neurological signs, and had residual meningoencephalitis when examined at termination but lacked mortality. The mallards had asymptomatic infection. These results indicate variation in the pathobiology of H5N1 virus infections in different species of wild waterfowl, ranging from severe, acute systemic disease with 100% mortality to asymptomatic infection of respiratory and gastrointestinal systems.

In a Muscovy duck breeding-growing farm in Aomori prefecture, most of ducklings hatched during spring in 1994 died within two-week-old. The mortality was nearly 100%. In most cases, birds died without clinical signs and some with leg weakness. By serological and virological tests, the outbreak was identified as a goose parvovirus infection. In pathological test, however, no typical manifestations of goose parvovirus infections (hepatitis and intranuclear inclusion bodies in hepatic cells) were detected.

Bar-headed goose (Anser indicus), a species endemic to Asia, has become one of the most popular species in recent years for rare bird breeding industries in several provinces of China. There has been no information on the gut metagenome configuration in both wild and artificially reared Bar-headed geese, even though the importance of gut microbiome in vertebrate nutrient and energy metabolism, immune homeostasis and reproduction is widely acknowledged. In this study, metagenomic methods have been used to describe the microbial community structure and composition of functional genes associated with both wild and artificially reared Bar-headed goose. Taxonomic analyses revealed that Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the four most abundant phyla in the gut of Bar-headed geese. Bacteroidetes were significantly abundant in the artificially reared group compared to wild group. Through functional profiling, we found that artificially reared Bar-headed geese had higher bacterial gene content related to carbohydrate transport and metabolism, energy metabolism and coenzyme transport, and metabolism. A comprehensive gene catalog of Bar-headed geese metagenome was built, and the metabolism of carbohydrate, amino acid, nucleotide, and energy were found to be the four most abundant categories. These results create a baseline for future Bar-headed goose microbiology research, and make an original contribution to the artificial rearing of this bird.

A trypsin inhibitor of Kazal type has been isolated from goose pancreas by affinity chromatography on immobilized anhydrotrypsin, anion exchange and reverse phase HPLC. It inhibits bovine beta-trypsin with the association constant (Ka) of 5.99 x 10(8) M-1. The complete amino-acid sequence was determined following CNBr treatment. The protein comprised a total of 69 amino-acid residues, corresponding to a molecular mass of 7.7 kDa. The P1-P'1 reactive site bond of the inhibitor was localized at position Lys25-Met26. The amino-acid sequence of GPTI shows extremely high homology to that of other inhibitors isolated from pancreas of birds.

Immunoreactive (ir-) adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and beta-endorphin (beta E) levels were determined in seven brain regions, in the three pituitary lobes, and in the plasma of the domestic gander by specific radioimmunoassays. In the brain regions studied the relative concentrations of ir-ACTH and ir-beta E were the highest in the mediobasal hypothalamus and in the paraventricular nucleus. There were lower levels of these peptides in the supraoptic nucleus, in the septum, and in the dorsal thalamus. Very low ir-ACTH and -beta E contents were found in the archistriatum and in the lobus parolfactorius. In the pars distalis of the pituitary gland the cephalic lobe contained about 10 times more ir-ACTH (3596 pmol/lobe) and 4 times more ir-beta E (867 pmol/ lobe) than the caudal lobe (383 pmol/lobe and 189 pmol/lobe, respectively). Sephadex G-50 chromatography of pooled cephalic and caudal lobe extracts resulted in two distinct ir-beta E peaks, with elution volumes corresponding to the mammalian beta-lipotropin and beta E, and three ir-ACTH peaks, the second one coeluting with mammalian ACTH. In the neural lobe the ir-ACTH/-beta E concentrations were similar to those in the hypothalamus. Resting plasma ir-ACTH (12.8 +/- 1.47 pmol/ml) but not ir-beta E (31.4 +/- 1.22 pmol/ml) levels were significantly increased following castration (to 41.4 +/- 1.11 pmol/ml). Serial blood sampling indicated pulsatile ir-beta E secretion (mean, coefficients of variation, and minimum-maximum range: 17.5, 62.78, and 2.9-49.7, respectively, for gander 1 and 23.3, 62.85, and 5.00-61.5, respectively, for gander 2).

Traditionally, the epidemiology of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in wild birds has been defined by detection of virus or viral RNA through virus isolation or reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Our goals were to estimate AIV antibody prevalence in Canada geese (Branta canadensis) and measure effects of age and location on these estimates. We collected 3,205 samples from nine states during June and July 2008 and 2009: Georgia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Washington, and West Virginia. Serum samples were tested for AIV antibodies with the use of a commercial blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Overall, 483 (15%) Canada geese had detectable antibodies to AIV. Significantly higher prevalences were detected in geese collected from northeastern and upper midwestern states compared with southeastern states. This trend is consistent with results from virus isolation studies reporting AIV prevalence in North American dabbling ducks. Within Pennsylvania, significantly higher antibody prevalences were detected in goose flocks sampled in urban locations compared to flocks sampled in rural areas. Antibody prevalence was significantly higher in after-hatch-year geese compared to hatch-year geese. No significant differences in prevalence were detected from 10 locations sampled during both years. Results indicate that Canada geese are frequently exposed to AIVs and, with resident populations, may potentially be useful as sentinels to confirm regional AIV transmission within wild bird populations.

We compared the receptor specificity of Newcastle disease viruses from a variety of avian species, including chickens and wild waterfowl, using hemagglutination tests with erythrocytes from different animal species. All isolates from wild waterfowl agglutinated horse erythrocytes, while the chicken isolates did not. The results showed that the receptor specificity of Newcastle disease viruses is different, depending on the avian species from which the viruses are isolated.

Surface waters frequently have been contaminated with human enteric viruses, and it is likely that animal enteric viruses have contaminated surface waters also. Bovine enteroviruses (BEV), found in cattle worldwide, usually cause asymptomatic infections and are excreted in the feces of infected animals in large numbers. In this study, the prevalence and genotype of BEV in a closed herd of cattle were evaluated and compared with BEV found in animals in the immediate environment and in environmental specimens. BEV was found in feces from 76% of cattle, 38% of white-tailed deer, and one of three Canada geese sharing the same pastures, as well as the water obtained from animal watering tanks, from the pasture, from streams running from the pasture to an adjacent river, and from the river, which emptied into the Chesapeake Bay. Furthermore, BEV was found in oysters collected from that river downstream from the farm. These findings suggest that BEV could be used as an indicator of fecal pollution originating from animals (cattle and/or deer). Partial sequence analysis of the viral genomes indicates that different viral variants coexist in the same area. The possibility of identifying the viral strains found in the animals and in the contaminated areas by sequencing the RNA genome, could provide a tool to find the origin of the contamination and should be useful for epidemiological and viral molecular evolution studies.

Toxoplasma gondii, a zoonotic protozoan parasite, infects mammals and birds worldwide. Infection in humans is often asymptomatic, though illnesses can occur in immunocompromised hosts and the fetuses of susceptible women infected during pregnancy. In Nunavik, Canada, 60% of the Inuit population has measurable antibodies against T. gondii. Handling and consumption of wildlife have been identified as risk factors for exposure. Serological evidence of exposure has been reported for wildlife in Nunavik; however, T. gondii has not been detected in wildlife tissues commonly consumed by Inuit.

Migratory birds have been implicated in the long-range spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A virus (H5N1) from Asia to Europe and Africa. Although sampling of healthy wild birds representing a large number of species has not identified possible carriers of influenza virus (H5N1) into Europe, surveillance of dead and sick birds has demonstrated mute (Cygnus olor) and whooper (C. cygnus) swans as potential sentinels. Because of concerns that migratory birds could spread H5N1 subtype to the Western Hemisphere and lead to its establishment within free-living avian populations, experimental studies have addressed the susceptibility of several indigenous North American duck and gull species. We examined the susceptibility of Canada geese (Branta canadensis) to HPAI virus (H5N1). Large populations of this species can be found in periagricultural and periurban settings and thus may be of potential epidemiologic importance if H5N1 subtype were to establish itself in North American wild bird populations.

Fifty samples of chicken, duck and geese faeces were obtained from 13 wet markets in Kuala Lumpur to study the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) among local market poultry. Biotyping of colonies grown on azide agar incubated at 45 degrees C yielded E. pseudoavium, E. faecalis, E. faecium and E. gallinarum from chicken faeces and E. malodoratus, E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. gallinarum, E. hirae/dispar, and E. durans from goose and duck faeces. On agar containing 6 mg/ l of vancomycin, one strain of E. flavescens was identified, giving a VRE detection rate of 2.0%. This isolate had a vancomycin M.I.C. of 8 mg/l as determined by the Etest, and the van C-3 gene that was identified by PCR followed by sequence analysis. The prevalence of VRE among poultry sold in local markets appears to be low, and may reflect the infrequent use of antimicrobials in our poultry farms. Nevertheless, the possibility of human acquisition of microbes via the food chain cautions against the use of antimicrobials in animal husbandry that may encourage the emergence and spread of multi-drug resistant organisms like the VRE among animal microbial flora.

Goose hemorrhagic polyomavirus (GHPV) is not a naturally occurring infection in geese in China; however, GHPV infection has been identified in Pekin ducks, a domestic duck species. Herein, we investigated the prevalence of GHPV in five domestic duck species (Liancheng white ducks, Putian black ducks, Shan Sheldrake, Shaoxing duck, and Jinyun Sheldrake) in China. We determined that the Jinyun Sheldrake duck species could be infected by GHPV with no clinical signs, whereas no infection was identified in the other four duck species. We sequenced the complete genome of the Jinyun Sheldrake origin GHPV. Genomic data comparison suggested that GHPVs share a conserved genomic structure, regardless of the host (duck or geese) or region (Asia or Europe). Jinyun Sheldrake origin GHPV genomic characterization and epidemiological studies will increase our understanding of potential heterologous reservoirs of GHPV.

Biophys. 201, 313-321) only the low affinity binding site was found. Graphical analyses of the data strongly suggest that each peptide of fatty acid synthetase contains one keto reductase domain with low affinity for NADPH and one enoyl reductase domain with high affinity for NADPH.

Ducks and geese were experimentally infected with the Mycobacterium avium. It was demonstrated that intramuscular and peroral infection causes morphological tuberculous changes. The first microscopically detectable changes induced by intramuscular infection occurred within 12 days. After 70 days from infection the affected organs were densely covered with tuberculous lesions. The development of microscopic changes is continuous and the development of affections is accompanied by an increase in the number of mycobacteria detectable in the sections. In ducks this trend is more pronounced than in geese. In both methods of infection liver and spleen are the first and the most frequent organs to be affected.

By HPLC, a taurine-conjugated bile acid with a retention time different from that of taurocholate was found to be present in the bile of the black-necked swan, Cygnus melanocoryphus. The bile acid was isolated and its structure, established by (1)H and (13)C NMR and mass spectrometry, was that of the taurine N-acyl amidate of 3alpha,7alpha,15alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholan-24-oic acid. The compound was shown to have chromatographic and spectroscopic properties that were identical to those of the taurine conjugate of authentic 3alpha,7alpha,15alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholan-24-oic acid, previously synthesized by us from ursodeoxycholic acid. By HPLC, the taurine conjugate of 3alpha,7alpha,15alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholan-24-oic acid was found to be present in 6 of 6 species in the subfamily Dendrocygninae (tree ducks) and in 10 of 13 species in the subfamily Anserinae (swans and geese) but not in other subfamilies in the Anatidae family. It was also not present in species from the other two families of the order Anseriformes. 3alpha,7alpha,15alpha-Trihydroxy-5beta-cholan-24-oic acid is a new primary bile acid that is present in the biliary bile acids of swans, tree ducks, and geese and may be termed 15alpha-hydroxy-chenodeoxycholic acid.

Waterfowl parvoviruses are divided into Muscovy duck parvoviruses (MDPVs) and goose parvoviruses (GPVs). Phylogenetic analysis based on structural gene nucleotide sequences showed that the strains of three GPVs (DY, PT and D strains) and two MDPVs (GX5 and SAAH-SHNH) are closely related and formed one cluster. Recombination analysis showed that recombination between GPV-GDFsh and MDPV-89384/FRANCE strains led to five recombinant strains: GPV-DY, GPV-PT, GPV-D, MDPV-GX5 and MDPV-SAAH-SHNH. The recombinant event was confirmed using the Simplot program and phylogenetic analysis. This is the first comprehensive investigation of recombination between MDPV and GPV structural genes.

Central corneal endothelia in a variety of lower- and higher vertebrate animals were photographed with a widefield specular microscope and analysed with either fixed-frame or computer-assisted morphometric analysis. The endothelium of the dogfish shark, an elasmobranch, contained 2300 cells mm-2 and demonstrated a very delicate irregular 'reversal pattern'. The goldfish, a teleost, had 432 cells mm-2 and displayed a jigsaw-puzzle-like pattern. The bullfrog, an amphibian, and the gecko, a reptile, had 550- and 481 cells mm-2, respectively, and a relatively uniform polygonal endothelial pattern similar to that observed in mammals. The goose, a bird, had a cell density of 2410 cells mm-2 with a uniform hexagonal pattern (79%) which was similar to mammalian (rat, 58-76%; rabbit, 71%; dog, 78%; human, 61-75%) hexagonal patterns. The findings on the endothelial appearance in these vertebrate animals suggest that a correlation exists between endothelial morphology, vertebrate phylogeny and their respective functional and structural capacity.

Amino acid sequences of the first half of MSEL- and VLDV-neurophysins from goose and chicken have been determined. Identical substitutions in positions 17, 18, 35, 36 and 41 of both neurophysins of a given species when compared with their mammalian counterparts suggest a gene conversion between vasotocin--MSEL-neurophysin and mesotocin--VLDV-neurophysin genes. This event, which has already been observed for three mammalian species, seems recurrent and would link the evolution of the two neurohypophysial hormone precursors.

Losses greater than 3% were incurred in a large flock of domestic geese on summer pasture. Necropsy of the sick birds revealed no significant bacterial or viral isolates. The trematodes Echinostoma revolutum and Notocotylus attenuatus were present in considerable numbers, respectively in the small and large intestines.

Neurological signs characterized by marked progressive weakness and convulsions culminating in death were observed in 3 goats over a 24-h period. Affected animals were in a group of 5 goats confined toa fenced paddock: a domestic goose within the paddock was also found dead. Present in the same paddock, but unaffected, were 2 other goats and an adult cow. Five days prior to the animals' deaths, the owner had trimmed the surrounding brush and had thrown the cuttings into the enclosure. Post mortem examination of 2 of the dead goats and the goose revealed reduced muscle mass and fat stores, serous atrophy of adipose tissue, and reduced gastrointestinal contents, which included numerous leaves identified as Carolina jessamine (Gelsemium sempervirens). Histologic lesions included mild diffuse neuronal degeneration and cerebellar Purkinje cell loss in all animals with mild multifocal vacuolation of brainstem and cerebral white matter in 1 goat, and myofiber atrophy with perimyseal fibrosis in the goose. Preexisting malnutrition and lack of adequate alternative forages likely resulted in ingestion of Carolina jessamine and subsequent toxicosis. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of Carolina jessamine toxicosis in goats and geese.

Mammalian retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) is a chief antiviral gene sensing viral RNA molecules including Newcastle disease virus (NDV). In this study, goose RIG-I gene (gRIG-I) was identified. The 2805 bp-long gene encodes a gRIG-I protein that exhibits 93.8% amino acid identity to duck RIG-I. DF-1 chicken fibroblast cells transfected with full-length of gRIG-I or CARD domain of gRIG-I plasmids respond significantly to the agonist of 21-mer 5'ppp RNA, evident through enhancement of IFN-β promoter activity. Goose RIG-I transfected 293T/17 cells were then tested for the response to NDV infection, resulting in up-regulated activity of IFN-β promoter, and mRNA levels of IRF-3 and IFIT1, but decreased virus titer. Similar results were obtained in transfected DF-1 chicken fibroblast cells and goose embryo fibroblast cells in response to NDV infections Animal experiments further support a role of gRIG-I in goose innate immunity against NDV infections by showing increased gRIG-I mRNA levels and decreased virus titer in geese lung and air sac post-infection.

Twelve-week-old Landes male geese were overfed with corn for 21 d in order to induce liver steatosis (fatty liver). Lipid composition of hepatocyte plasma membranes from fatty livers was compared to that of lean livers obtained from geese fed a normal diet. The ratio cholesterol/phospholipids was higher in fatty hepatocyte plasma membranes (0.63 vs. 0.47), whereas the phospholipid/protein ratio was less than half. Overfeeding induced changes in fatty acid composition of hepatocyte plasma membranes, including a greater than twofold increase in the percentage of oleic acid (29.7 vs. 13.8%) and a somewhat lesser increase in lauric, palmitic, and palmitoleic acid contents of plasma membrane lipids of fatty livers. A concomitant reduction in the proportion of stearic acid (18.4 vs. 25.1%) was also observed. In fatty livers, the increased ratio of saturated to polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (1.5 vs. 1.0) was related to a significant decrease in PUFA content. Among all the PUFA, only the eicosatrienoic acid (20:3n-9) percentage was increased by liver steatosis. Overfeeding with corn appeared to induce competition between de novo synthesized and dietary fatty acids incorporated in hepatocyte plasma membranes. This resulted in an accumulation of de novo synthesized monounsaturated and derived fatty acids in plasma membranes from overfed birds. A defect in the incorporation of linoleic acid and linoleic- and linolenic-derived PUFA was observed despite the high proportion of these essential fatty acids in the diet. It was concluded that in overfed palmipeds, de novo hepatic lipogenesis prevails over dietary lipid intake to modulate lipid composition of the fatty liver plasma membrane.

Antibodies to Newcastle disease virus (NDV) as measured by hemagglutination-inhibition and virus-neutralization tests were detected in 40/236 Canada geese captured while in their southward migration or in their wintering grounds. Antibodies were also found in 37/267 wild ducks and in 20/31 domestic geese. Adult geese were readily infected by several routes. Inapparent disease usually resulted, and only 1/13 cases were fatal. Goose embryos responded differently to inoculation with selected NDV strains than did chicken embryos of comparative developmental stages. Some goslings that hatched from inoculated embryos died and were found to have virus, whereas others survived and developed active antibodies. Four strains of virus isolated from migratory ducks of the Pacific flyway were characterized. All 4 strains were lentogenic but differed from lentogenic strains prevalent in chickens by being thermostable. It is proposed that wild waterfowl neither receive their ND infection from domestic poultry nor pass their disease to poultry. The virus reservoir probably exists in nature.

To facilitate the cloning of delta-crystallin gene, the product of which is a major lens protein present in the avian and reptilian lenses, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed to amplify cDNAs constructed from the poly(A)+RNA of goose lenses. The PCR product was then subcloned into pUC19 vector and transformed in E. coli strain JM109. Plasmids purified from the positive clones were prepared for nucleotide sequencing by dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method. Sequencing several clones containing 1.4 kb DNA inserts encoding delta-crystallin constructed a complete and unambiguous full-length reading frame of 1401 base pairs covering a deduced protein sequence of 465 amino acids excluding the universal translation-initiating methionine. The goose delta-crystallin shows 88, 94, 88 and 69% sequence identity to pigeon delta, duck delta 2, chicken delta 1 crystallins and human argininosuccinate lyase respectively. It is also shown that, similar to duck delta 2 and in contrast to pigeon delta crystallin, goose delta-crystallin appears to possess high argininosuccinate lyase activity despite the fact that a highly homologous structure is shared among these homologous proteins. Structural analysis and comparison of these closely related delta-crystallin homologues with or without enzymatic activity should be of value in unraveling the intriguing evolutionary process leading to the development and evolution of active enzymatic crystallins in the lenses of certain avian species.

In the study of the mechanism of lysozyme-catalyzed reactions, it has been assumed that the rate constants in the catalytic process, the catalytic activity of catalytic group Glu 35, are independent of the degree of polymerization (size) of the substrate. The characteristics of substrate binding subsite F have recently been reexamined and the substrate binding mode at this subsite has been demonstrated to be more complex than expected from a model based on an X-ray analysis of the lysozyme-substrate complex. In the present study, the time courses of the lysozyme-catalyzed reactions with the substrates chitotetraose [(GlcNAc)4], chitopentaose [(GlcNAc)5], and chitohexaose [(GlcNAc)6], of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranose (GlcNAc), were obtained experimentally with high-performance liquid chromatography. From the experimental time courses, the values of the rate constants, k+1 (the cleavage of glycosidic linkage) and k-1/k+2 (relative efficiency of transglycosylation), were obtained by a data-fitting method with computer simulation of the lysozyme-catalyzed reaction (A. Masaki et al. (1981) J. Biochem. 90, 1167-1175). As a result, it was found that the k+1 value is dependent on the substrate size and the value of the binding free energy of subsite F is considerably smaller than previously estimated. The substrate size dependence of the k+1 value is considered to relate closely to the fine structure of the binding and catalytic sites.

Various farm animal breeds have been domesticated and bred for thousands years, and they provide adequate animal-derived proteins to meet the human nutrition requirement. Although quantitative genetics was applied in animal breeding, which launched a technological revolution in the past century, a number of complex traits remain difficult to be selected based on pedigree derived breeding, due to complicated animal genetics and development mechanisms. Farm animal's genetic potential hasn't yet to be fully exploited. The concept and technology from the Human Genome Project have greatly promoted farm animal genomic researches. It is possible to fine map the causal variations at the whole genome level and then exploit their biological functions, thus providing the theoretical basis for molecular designed breeding. In this review, we summarize the genomics research progress of main farm animals during the past decade, including pigs, cattle, yaks, goats, sheep, chickens, ducks and geese. We focus on the reference genome sequencing and follow-up population-level genomic studies based on high throughput resequencing technologies, and meanwhile envision the future work of farm animal genomics.

Embryonal central nervous system (CNS) tumor is a rare malignant neoplasm that arises from the neural crest. Herein we describe an embryonal tumor in the brain of an adult male domestic goose ( Anser anser) that was euthanized after a short history of wandering and lethargy. Grossly, a focal, bright-red, soft plaque was present on the ventral aspect of the brain, extending from the optic chiasm to the midbrain, as well as into the dorsal neuroparenchyma. Histologically, the nodule consisted of a poorly demarcated population of neoplastic cells arranged in streams and bundles, and occasionally palisading around small capillaries (pseudorosettes). Neoplastic cells were elongate and had scant, finely granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm, and elongate nuclei with dense chromatin. Mitoses were uncommon. Scattered foci of intratumoral necrosis and microvascular proliferation were present. Neoplastic cells were immunoreactive for doublecortin and neuronal nuclei. Ultrastructurally, neoplastic cells had elongated-to-polyhedral cytoplasm with short processes, scarce intermediate filaments, and small round mitochondria and rough endoplasmic reticulum. The cell membrane had varied numbers of intercellular anchoring-like junctions, and nuclei were round-to-elongate and had marginal aggregates of heterochromatin. Morphologic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural findings in our case are consistent with a poorly differentiated embryonal tumor.

Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) are genetically separated by geographical barriers, resulting in the independent evolution of North American and Eurasian lineages. In the present study, to determine whether AIVs possessing the North American-origin nonstructural (NS) gene were previously introduced into South Korea, we performed a genetic analysis of AIVs isolated from fecal samples of migratory birds. We detected seven viruses possessing the North American-origin NS allele B among 413 AIV-positive samples obtained during AI surveillance between 2012 and 2017. We found evidence for the intercontinental transmission of at least three genetically distinct clusters of the B allele of the North American-origin NS gene into Eurasia at a low frequency. The host species of three viruses were identified as the greater white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons) using a DNA barcoding technique. Moreover, we used GPS-CDMA-based telemetry to determine the migration route of the greater white-fronted goose between the Far East of Russia and South Korea and found that this species may play an important role as an intermediate vector in the intercontinental transmission of AIVs. To improve our understanding of the role of wild birds in the ecology of AIVs, advanced AIV surveillance is required in the Far East of Russia as well as in Alaska region of Beringia accompanied by host identification and wild bird tracking.

Goose hemorrhagic polyomavirus (GHPV) is the causative agent of hemorrhagic nephritis enteritis of geese (HNEG), one of the major diseases of domestic geese in Europe. This case report describes a persistent outbreak of a GHPV infection on a Belgian goose farm. Clinical symptoms, necropsy lesions, and histopathologic lesions observed were compatible with previous reports of HNEG outbreaks. PCR analysis confirmed the diagnosis of GHPV. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an outbreak of a GHPV infection on a Belgian goose farm. This is evidence that GHPV is not only present in countries known for extensive waterfowl production, but disease outbreaks also occur in countries with less extensive goose production.

The role of the two disulfide bonds (Cys4-Cys60 and Cys18-Cys29) in the activity and stability of goose-type (G-type) lysozyme was investigated using ostrich egg-white lysozyme as a model. Each of the two disulfide bonds was deleted separately or simultaneously by substituting both Cys residues with either Ser or Ala. No remarkable differences in secondary structure or catalytic activity were observed between the wild-type and mutant proteins. However, thermal and guanidine hydrochloride unfolding experiments revealed that the stabilities of mutants lacking one or both of the disulfide bonds were significantly decreased relative to those of the wild-type. The destabilization energies of mutant proteins agreed well with those predicted from entropic effects in the denatured state. The effects of deleting each disulfide bond on protein stability were found to be approximately additive, indicating that the individual disulfide bonds contribute to the stability of G-type lysozyme in an independent manner. Under reducing conditions, the thermal stability of the wild-type was decreased to a level nearly equivalent to that of a Cys-free mutant (C4S/C18S/C29S/C60S) in which all Cys residues were replaced by Ser. Moreover, the optimum temperature of the catalytic activity for the Cys-free mutant was downshifted by about 20 degrees C as compared with that of the wild-type. These results indicate that the formation of the two disulfide bonds is not essential for the correct folding into the catalytically active conformation, but is crucial for the structural stability of G-type lysozyme.

To identify molecule(s) with the properties of rubella virus (RV) receptor, goose erythrocyte membranes were isolated and tested for their ability to complete with whole cells for viral binding and fusion. Solubilized membranes showed a dose-dependent inhibiting activity on either rubella virus attachment or its fusion with erythrocytes at acidic pH. The inhibitory activity was enhanced by trypsin and neuraminidase, and inactivated by phospholipase A2 digestion, pointing towards the involvement of lipid structures as receptor sites for RV. After isolation of the different membrane components, only the lipid moiety, specifically phospholipids and glycolipids, was found to inhibit viral biological activities. When the major membrane lipids were examined separately, phosphatidylserine and cerebroside sulfate showed a strong inhibiting activity on viral hemagglutination and subsequent hemolysis. The capacity of several pure phospholipids (phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin) to inhibit the hemolysis but not the binding of the virus to the erythrocytes indicated that different membrane lipid components are involved in the attachment and the fusion step. Enzymatic and chemical modifications of whole erythrocytes confirmed the role of membrane lipid molecules in the cell surface receptor for RV.

Duck virus enteritis occurred in the spring of 1982 among domesticated mallards, Pekin ducks and geese producing eggs for the same hatchery. Wild mallards may have introduced the infection to the domestic birds. High mortality occurred in one flock of Pekin ducks and in young geese. Mallards were also affected, but less severely. Gross and microscopic lesions were in general typical for DVE. Virus was demonstrated by electron microscopy of Bursa fabricii from experimentally infected ducklings. Neutralizing antibodies were found in serum from ducks, surviving an acute outbreak in the flock. Vaccination was performed and hygienic precautions taken, and transmission from infected flocks to progeny was negligible.

Surveillance of avian influenza virus and paramyxovirus in migratory waterfowl and shorebirds was conducted in the San-in district of western Japan from the winter of 2001 to 2008. From 4,335 fecal samples from wild birds, 41 avian influenza viruses of 12 different HA and NA combinations, including two H5N3 strains, and 13 avian paramyxoviruses were isolated. Phylogenetic analysis of HA genes revealed that H5N3 strains clustered in a different branch from the recent highly pathogenic H5N1 isolates in Japan; however, the introduction of new highly pathogenic avian influenza virus by migratory birds cannot be ignored. Therefore, it is necessary to continue surveillance of these potentially serious pathogens in waterfowl and shorebirds.

A model-based proton resonance frequency shift (PRFS) thermometry method was developed to significantly reduce the temperature quantification errors encountered in the conventional phase mapping method and the spatiotemporal limitations of the spectroscopic thermometry method. Spectral data acquired using multi-echo gradient echo (GRE) is fit into a two-component signal model containing temperature information and fat is used as the internal reference. The noniterative extended Prony algorithm is used for the signal fitting and frequency estimate. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the advantages of the method for optimal water-fat separation and temperature estimation accuracy. Phantom experiments demonstrate that the model-based method effectively reduces the interscan motion effects and frequency disturbances due to the main field drift. The thermometry result of ex vivo goose liver experiment with high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) heating was also presented in the paper to indicate the feasibility of the model-based method in real tissue.

Geese are extremely adept in utilizing plant-derived roughage within their diet. However, the intestinal microbiome of geese remains limited, especially the dietary effect on microbial diversity. Cassava foliage was widely used in animal feed, but little information is available for geese. In this study, the geese were fed with control diet (CK), experimental diet supplemented with 5% cassava foliage (CF5) or 10% (CF10) for 42 days, respectively. The cecal samples were collected after animals were killed. High-throughput sequencing technology was used to investigate the microbial diversity in the caecum of geese with different dietary supplements. Taxonomic analysis indicated that the predominant phyla were distinct with different dietary treatments. The phyla Firmicutes (51.4%), Bacteroidetes (29.55%) and Proteobacteria (7.90%) were dominant in the CK group, but Bacteroidetes (65.19% and 67.29%,) Firmicutes (18.01% and 17.39%), Proteobacteria (8.72% and 10.18%), Synergistete (2.51% and 1.76%) and Spirochaetes (2.60% and 1.46%) were dominant in CF5 and CF10 groups. The abundance of Firmicutes was negatively correlated with the supplementation of cassava foliage. However, the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria were positively correlated with the supplementation of cassava foliage. Our study also revealed that the microbial communities were significantly different at genus levels. Genes related to nutrient and energy metabolism, immunity and signal transduction pathways were primarily enriched by the microbiome.

Follicular atresia in the ovary of the domestic goose was investigated by light microscopic, steroid RIA and lysosomal enzyme activity measuring methods during the spring reproduction cycle. Degenerative processes are associated with the transformation and proliferation of granulosa, internal and external thecal cells in the follicle. Seven types of atretic follicles were identified on the basis of the presence, absence or dominance of cells containing lipids and synthesizing steroids. Conclusive evidence for the relation between cell type and hormone content was found only in one type: in type 6, stromal glandular cells show an extremely intensive PROG synthesizing activity. In the other types it was shown that glandular type of cells which become proliferative during atresia possess a relatively uniform steroid synthesizing ability. This uniformity is also seen in the high activity of lysosomal enzymes regardless of the size and type of atretic follicles.

West Nile virus (WNV) caused disease outbreaks in Israel in the 1950s and the late 1970s. In 1998 an outbreak of WNV in goose farms and evidence of infection in dead migratory birds were reported. Consequently, human diagnostic services for WNV were resumed, including virus isolation, serology, and RT-PCR. Risk factors for infection were assessed by a serological survey in 1999, which revealed a seroprevalence of (a) 86% in people who had close contact with sick geese, (b) 28% in people in areas along bird migration routes, and (c) 27% in the general population. Following two fatal cases in Tel Aviv in September 1999 and one encephalitis case in the southern Eilot region, a regional serological survey was initiated there. The survey revealed two more WNV-associated acute encephalitis cases, an IgG seroprevalence of 51%, and an IgM seroprevalence of 22%. In the summer of 2000, acute cases of WN disease were identified in the central and northern parts of Israel, involving 439 people. The outbreak started in mid-August, peaked in September, and declined in October, with 29 fatal cases, primarily in the elderly. During the outbreak, diagnosis was based on IgM detection. Four virus isolates were subsequently obtained from preseroconverted frozen sera. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of 1662 bases covering the PreM, M, and part of the E genes revealed two lineages. One lineage was closely related to a 1999 Israeli bird (gull) isolate and to a 1999 New York bird (flamingo) isolate, and the other lineage was closely related to a 1997 Romanian mosquito isolate and to a 1999 Russian human brain isolate.

The goal of this study was to assess the contributions of the most important acid glycosidases to the processes connected with testes involution (in the summer) and spermatogenesis during the reproductive season (the spring) in ganders. Statistically significant increases in the specific activity of N-acetyl-beta-D-hexosaminidase, alpha-D-galactosidase, beta-D-galactosidase, and alpha-L-fucosidase during the period of testes involution were detected. Alpha-D-galactosidase, beta-D-galactosidase, and alpha-D-glucosidase showed an increase in the relative contribution of those multiple forms which are characterized by less acidic values of the pI during the reproductive season. It is suggested that the observed increases in the specific activity of beta-HEX, alpha-GAL, beta-GAL and alpha-FUC may be connected with the catabolism of glycoconjugates, when the spermatogenic activity of the testes declines. The increases in the relative contribution of less acidic forms of alpha-GAL, beta-GAL, and alpha-GLU during the reproductive season may be linked to the rise in the number of spermatocytes, spermatids and spermatozoa during spermatogenesis.

The roles of Glu(73), which has been proposed to be a catalytic residue of goose type (G-type) lysozyme based on X-ray structural studies, were investigated by means of its replacement with Gln, Asp, and Ala using ostrich egg-white lysozyme (OEL) as a model. No remarkable differences in secondary structure or substrate binding ability were observed between the wild type and Glu(73)-mutated proteins, as evaluated by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and chitin-coated celite chromatography. Substitution of Glu(73) with Gln or Ala abolished the enzymatic activity toward both the bacterial cell substrate and N-acetylglucosamine pentamer, (GlcNAc)(5), while substitution with Asp did not abolish but drastically reduced the activity of OEL. These results demonstrate that the carboxyl group of Glu(73) is directly involved in the catalytic action of G-type lysozyme. Furthermore, the stabilities of all three mutants, which were determined from the thermal and guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) unfolding curves, respectively, were significantly decreased relative to those of the wild type. The results obtained clearly indicate the crucially important roles of Glu(73) in the structural stability as well as in the catalytic activity of G-type lysozyme.

This article has been retracted: please see Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal (http://www.elsevier.com/locate/withdrawalpolicy). This article has been retracted at the request of the Authors. It has come to the attention of the corresponding author that there are two errors in Section 3.1 of the Results section titled “Effect of overfeeding on gene expression and enzyme activity of several genes in liver”. The first error is that the article contains the wrong number of overfeeding days. The second error is that there are incorrect correlations between liver weight, lipids content in live and plasma metabolic substrates because of the wrong overfeeding days. The authors take responsibility for them and apologize to the readership of Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology.

Embden goose (GEWL) and Barbary duck (DEWL) egg white lysozymes possess different amino acid sequences corresponding to the g-type and c-type, respectively. GEWL was shown to be a better immunogen than DEWL in both rabbits and mice. The antigenicity of the two lysozymes was tested using different techniques (i.e. indirect ELISA, inhibition tests and immunoabsorption experiments). Injection of either GEWL or DEWL into rabbits and mice induced both specific antibodies and cross-reacting antibodies. Moreover, anti-GEWL antibodies, in contrast to anti-DEWL antibodies, did not cross-react with hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL), a c-type lysozyme. While the structure of GEWL was not modified after binding to plastic, DEWL was denaturated, but it did keep some native epitopes. It was concluded that g-type and c-type lysozymes, which have different amino acid sequences, exhibit strong common antigenic properties.

A total of 607 Pasteurella multocida strains were isolated in Israel from turkeys, geese, and chickens. Serotyping was carried out by the gel-diffusion precipitin test. The antigens were heat-stable saline extracts of the organisms, and the diagnostic sera were produced in chickens using formalinized bacterins. Among 31 serotypes containing one to five antigenic factors, serotypes 1 and 3 accounted for 58.1%, 80.8%, and 88.9% isolants from turkeys, geese, and chickens, respectively. On the basis of the incidence of these serotypes in the flocks examined, serotype 1 was predominant. The variety of antigenic components was greatest for strains from turkeys, with some untypable. The record of isolants from various flocks indicated the wide distribution of many of the strains. Attention was drawn to strains with multiple antigenic factors and the possible implication of their presence in the preparation and use of vaccines.

We examined seroprevalence (presence of detectable antibodies in serum) for avian influenza viruses (AIV) among 4,485 birds, from 11 species of wild waterfowl in Alaska (1998-2010), sampled during breeding/molting periods. Seroprevalence varied among species (highest in eiders (Somateria and Polysticta species), and emperor geese (Chen canagica)), ages (adults higher than juveniles), across geographic locations (highest in the Arctic and Alaska Peninsula) and among years in tundra swans (Cygnus columbianus). All seroprevalence rates in excess of 60% were found in marine-dependent species. Seroprevalence was much higher than AIV infection based on rRT-PCR or virus isolation alone. Because pre-existing AIV antibodies can infer some protection against highly pathogenic AIV (HPAI H5N1), our results imply that some wild waterfowl in Alaska could be protected from lethal HPAIV infections. Seroprevalence should be considered in deciphering patterns of exposure, differential infection, and rates of AIV transmission. Our results suggest surveillance programs include species and populations with high AIV seroprevalences, in addition to those with high infection rates. Serologic testing, including examination of serotype-specific antibodies throughout the annual cycle, would help to better assess spatial and temporal patterns of AIV transmission and overall disease dynamics.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ACTH, phytoestrogens (genistein, daidzein, biochanin A and coumestrol), and animal estrogens (estradiol and estrone) on corticosterone secretion by isolated adrenocortical cells of the ganders in breeding (April) and nonbreeding seasons (July). ACTH stimulated corticosterone output in the breeding season. In July (photorefractoriness and postbreeding molt) ACTH had no effect on corticosterone production. Coumestrol reduced corticosterone secretion by the cells obtained in nonbreeding season. Other examined phytoestrogens did not affect corticosterone production. Estrogens showed differentiated effects. Estradiol stimulated the corticosterone output in breeding season; estrone inhibited corticosterone release in July. The season can probably affect sensitivity of isolated gander adrenal cells, especially to ACTH. It seems that goose adrenocortical cells, in contrast to the mammalian cells, can be weakly sensitive to phytoestrogens.

Nicarbazin (NCZ), a coccidiostat commonly used in the poultry industry, causes reduced hatchability and egg quality in layer hens at a concentration of 125 ppm (8.4 mg/kg) in the feed. Although this effect is undesirable in the poultry industry, NCZ could provide a useful wildlife contraception tool for waterfowl, particularly urban geese. We tested the absorption of NCZ in chickens (Gallus gallus), mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), and Canada geese (Branta canadensis) gavaged with 8.4 mg of NCZ/kg per bird each day for 8 d. Plasma levels of 4,4'-dinitrocarbanilide (DNC) differed significantly among species. Peak plasma DNC levels were 2.87 +/- 0.15 microg/mL, 2.39 +/- 0.15 microg/mL, and 1.53 +/- 0.15 microg/ mL in chickens, mallards, and Canada geese respectively. It took 6 d to obtain peak DNC levels in chickens as opposed to 8 d in mallards and Canada geese. The half life of DNC in plasma was 1.43 d in chickens, 0.72 d in mallards, and 1.26 d in Canada geese. Mallards eliminated 100% of plasma DNC 4 d post-treatment, whereas Canada geese eliminated 100% of plasma DNC 8 d post-treatment. Chickens had only eliminated 99% of plasma DNC 8 d post-treatment. Mallard plasma DNC levels were highly correlated with Canada goose plasma DNC levels. This research showed mallards are an ideal model species for the Canada goose for future reproductive studies on NCZ in a laboratory setting. However, levels higher than 8.4 mg/kg must be fed to waterfowl in order to obtain a plasma level comparable to chickens.

S-Acyl fatty acid synthase thioester hydrolase, the enzyme responsible for release of short-chain fatty acids from fatty acid synthase, was purified to homogeneity in 50-60% yield by a procedure involving affinity chromatography with fatty acid synthase as the affinity ligand attached to Sepharose. This procedure gave a 10- to 12-fold increase in yield over the previously available method.

Most migratory birds depend on stopover sites, which are essential for refueling during migration and affect their population dynamics. In the East Asian⁻Australasian Flyway (EAAF), however, the stopover ecology of migratory waterfowl is severely under-studied. The knowledge gaps regarding the timing, intensity and duration of stopover site usages prevent the development of effective and full annual cycle conservation strategies for migratory waterfowl in EAAF. In this study, we obtained a total of 33,493 relocations and visualized 33 completed spring migratory paths of five geese species using satellite tracking devices. We delineated 2,192,823 ha as the key stopover sites along the migration routes and found that croplands were the largest land use type within the stopover sites, followed by wetlands and natural grasslands (62.94%, 17.86% and 15.48% respectively). We further identified the conservation gaps by overlapping the stopover sites with the World Database on Protected Areas (PA). The results showed that only 15.63% (or 342,757 ha) of the stopover sites are covered by the current PA network. Our findings fulfil some key knowledge gaps for the conservation of the migratory waterbirds along the EAAF, thus enabling an integrative conservation strategy for migratory water birds in the flyway.

The possibility of the determination of rabies antibodies by the serological method has been demonstrated, involving the use of culture rabies virus, strain Vnukovo-32, concentrated and purified by high speed centrifugation, for the sensitization of anserine erythrocytes. The neutralization test in mice and the passive hemagglutination test showed a correlation in rabies antibody titers in the sera of animlas immunized with rabies vaccines. The advantages of the passive hemagglutination test consist in the rapidity of obtaining the results, in a simple and economic method of carrying out the test.

In a novel adherence model using tracheal rings removed from Papio anubis, we have demonstrated a functional role for the fimbriae of Bordetella pertussis. When compared to wild-type strains, B. pertussis mutants specifically deficient in fimbriae adhered less well to the tracheal rings but better to Vero (Green monkey kidney) cells. In contrast, mutants deficient in filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA) production had reduced adherence to both Vero cells and the tracheal rings. These observations indicate that the fimbriae of B. pertussis, like those of many other bacterial pathogens, may play an important role in the initial stages of colonisation.

In recent years, emerging pathogens have received special attention due to their consequences for public health. Given that Arcobacter has been isolated in Costa Rica from commercial meat poultry samples, the aim of this research was to determine its isolation frequency from laying hens, broilers, ducks, and geese and to compare two types of samples, namely, cloacal swabs and stool collection. Arcobacter was isolated from 22 (11%) of the 200 samples examined. Fifteen (55%), eight (30%), and four (15%) of the isolated strains were identified as A. butzleri, A. cryareophilus, and Arcobacter spp., respectively. Also, there is a statistically significant difference among the isolation frequencies of Arcobacter for the types of samples evaluated, yielding more isolates from stool samples than from cloacal swab collection. This work describes the distribution of Arcobacter in farm animals as potential sources for its spread from animal-derived products.

Following a recent incident of human philophthalmosis in Israel, the intramolluscan larval trematode fauna in snails randomly collected from the suspected water source was checked. Of the snails examined, only Melanopsis praemorsa shed cercariae, including a Philophthalmus cercaria. To identify the philophthalmid species involved, chicks were experimentally infected with metacercariae of the trematode, subsequently yielding mature trematodes resembling those of P. palpebrarum. The majority of trematodes obtained, whether from one-worm infections or from multiple-worm infections resulting in a single trematode in one of the eyes, were relatively small and showed only immature eggs in their uteri. This finding suggests that the existing descriptions of two species of Philophthalmus purportedly harbouring eggs with non-oculate miracidia, namely P. palpebrarum and P. nyrocae, are actually based on immature specimens from one-worm infections that precluded cross-fertilisation. If this be true, then all species of the genus Philophthalmus produce eggs that, when mature, contain oculate miracidia. The species encountered in Israel is thus most likely P. palpebrarum.

An outbreak of disease in a White Rhine laying goose flock was characterized by increased water uptake, increased mortality, production of eggs with abnormal shells, a 25% drop in egg production and 40% embryo mortality. Affected dead or sacrificed birds had sero-fibrinogranulocytic peritonitis and salpingitis, infiltration of the lamina propria in the uterus and heterophil granulocytes in the isthmus and magnum of the oviduct. Mycoplasmas, mainly identified as Mycoplasma sp. strain 1220, were isolated from the airsac, liver, ovary, magnum and peritoneum of some affected geese. Strain 1220 was originally isolated from a Hungarian gander with phallus inflammation and, according to detailed biochemical and serological examinations, it is expected to represent a new avian species within the genus Mycoplasma.

To explore the mutation characteristic of growth hormone (GH) gene in geese, all the exons and introns of the gene were amplified by 20 pairs of primers, and then single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and subsequently confirmed by sequencing. There were six SNPs per 1000 nucleotides in exons compared to two SNPs per 1000 nucleotides in intron regions. The variant in exons contained only one non-synonymous mutation and three synonymous mutations. The results show that its sequence identity with chicken and duck were 77.54% and 92.38%, respectively, which may be concluded that the GH gene was highly conservative in phylogenesis, although there were differences between waterfowls and chicken in their evolution process.

1. Total pancreatectomy in the goose, in addition to the effects previously described (fatal hypoglycaemia and impaired tolerance), increases markedly the plasma amino-acid level. This increase corresponds to a significant rise in individually tested plasma amino-acids. In addition, pancreatectomy suppresses the hyperglycaemia which normally follows arginine treatment. 2. Oral administration of arginine induces hyperglycaemia in normal, but not in depancreatized geese. Therefore, the arginine effect upon the blood glucose level could be mediated by glucagon. Plasma glucose and glucagon changes, in normal animals with oral administration or i.v. infusion (Khemiss and Sitbon, 1982), agree with this conclusion. 3. Conversely, alanine elicits hyperglycaemia in normal animals, and such hyperglycaemia persists in pancreatectomized geese. Therefore, in the goose, in contrast to the duck, alanine appears to be a strong gluconeogenic amino-acid. These experiments with alanine indicate that closely related species, such as ducks and geese, may present important physiological differences.

The present study focused on carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) and organic loading rate (OLR) optimization of goose manure (GM) and wheat straw (WS). Dealing the anaerobic digestion of poultry manure on industrial scale; the question of optimum C/N (mixing ratio) and OLR (daily feeding concentration) have significant importance still lack in literature. Therefore, Batch and CSTR co-digestion experiments of the GM and WS were carried out at mesophilic condition. The alkali (NaOH) solubilization pretreatment for the WS had greatly enhanced its anaerobic digestibility. The highest methane production was evaluated between the C/N of 20-30 during Batch experimentation while for CSTRs; the second applied OLR of (3g.VS/L.d) was proved as the optimum with maximum methane production capability of 254.65ml/g.VS for reactor B at C/N of 25. The C/N and OLR regression optimization models were developed for their commercial scale usefulness.

Ivage geese were fattened for 6 weeks; 3-5 weeks later, with diminished food intake, they developed degenerative ultrastructural changes of the myocardium: frequent myelin-like bodies, fragmentation and sometimes contractive bundles of myofibrils, lipid droplets, nuclear lobulation and focal cytolysis were observed. Adaptive changes included hypermetabolic mitochondria with many crists, dilated endoplasmic reticulum and plenty of pinocytotic vacuoles in capillary endothelium.

Lysozymes (3.2.1.17) from goose (Anser anser) egg white, turkey (Melagris gallopavo) egg white, phage T4 and human milk were compared with hen egg white lysozyme in their ability to clear a suspension of Micrococcus lysodeikticus. All of the lysozymes, except hen egg white lysozyme, catalysed the clearing of the Micrococcus lysodeikticus suspension in a biphasic fashion. Compared to hen egg white lysozyme, the total absorbance or transmission change over 5 and 20 minutes was less in all cases, except for human lysozyme. Human lysozyme was, therefore, a potential alternative, more rapid signal generator for the measurement of urinary estrone glucuronide excretion rates because of its structural similarity to hen egg white lysozyme. The apparent K(M) values for hen egg white lysozyme increased with the enzyme concentration.

'Brachyspira hampsonii' is a recently proposed new species within the Brachyspira genus, which produces a dysentery-like disease in pigs. This study aims at investigating whether a 'B. hampsonii' isolate recovered from a migrating waterfowl was capable of colonizing pig intestines, inducing clinical signs of dysentery and being transmitted among pigs. Eleven 7-week-old pigs were randomly assigned into two separate groups which were orally administered an avian isolate of 'B. hampsonii' (inoculated group, n = 5) or BHI broth (control group, n = 6). After inoculation, three pigs from the control group were placed in the inoculated pen and served as sentinel pigs. Our results show the capacity of this avian 'B. hampsonii' isolate to colonize the large intestine of pigs and to be transmitted among pigs. According to this, migrating birds could play a role in the epidemiology of 'B. hampsonii' as a possible source of infection in swine populations.

The peptidergic melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) system was investigated by immunocytochemistry in several birds. MCH perikarya were found in the periventricular hypothalamic nucleus near the paraventricular organ and in the lateral hypothalamic areas. Immunoreactive fibers were very abundant in the ventral pallidum, in the nucleus of the stria terminalis, and in the septum/diagonal band complex, where immunoreactive pericellular nets were prominent. Many fibers innervated the whole preoptic area, the lateral hypothalamic area, and the infundibular region. Some fibers also reached the dorsal thalamus and the epithalamus. The median eminence contained only sparse projections, and the posterior pituitary was not labeled. Thus, in birds, a neurohormonal role for MCH is not likely. Immunoreactive fibers were observed in other regions, such as the intercollicular nucleus, stratum griseum periventriculare (mesencephalic tectum), central gray, nigral complex (especially the ventral tegmental area), reticular areas, and raphe nuclei. Although no physiological investigation concerning the role of MCH has been performed in birds, the distribution patterns of the immunoreactive perikarya and fibers observed suggest that MCH may be involved in functions similar to those described in rats. In particular, the projections to parts of the limbic system (ventropallidal ganglia, septal complex, hypothalamus, dorsal thalamus, and epithalamus) and to structures concerned with visceral and other sensory information integration suggest that MCH acts as a neuromodulator involved in a wide variety of physiological and behavioral adaptations (arousal) with regard to feeding, drinking, and reproduction.

During the latter stages of the lethal H5N2 influenza eradication program in domestic poultry in Pennsylvania in 1983-84, surveillance of waterfowl was done to determine if these birds harbored influenza viruses that might subsequently appear in poultry. From late June to November 1984, 182 hemagglutinating viruses were isolated from 2043 wild birds, primarily ducks, in the same geographical area as the earlier lethal H5N2 avian influenza outbreak. The virus isolates from waterfowl included paramyxoviruses (PMV-1, -4, and -6) and influenza viruses of 13 antigenic combinations. There was only one H5N2 isolate from a duck. Although this virus was antigenically related to the lethal H5N2 virus, genetic and antigenic analysis indicated that it could be discriminated from the virulent family of H5N2 viruses, and it did not originate from chickens. Many of the influenza viruses obtained from wild ducks were capable of replicating in chickens after experimental inoculation but did not cause disease. These studies show that many influenza A virus strains circulating in waterfowl in the vicinity of domestic poultry in Pennsylvania did not originate from domestic poultry. These influenza viruses from wild ducks were capable of infecting poultry; however, transmission of these viruses to poultry apparently was avoided by good husbandry and control measures.

Tembusu virus (TMUV) is a member of the genus Flavivirus. Outbreak of this virus infection in duck flocks was first observed in China in April 2010, causing severe egg drop and neurological signs in laying ducks. Recently reported duck infections in southeastern Asia highlighted the need for well-validated diagnostic methods of TMUV surveillance to understand its epidemiological characteristics and maintenance in nature. Several enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the detection of TMUV infection have been reported, but none have been applied to high-throughput diagnostics.

Intracranial injections of 6-OHDA were used to destroy the following brain areas of male geese: bilateral VMH-mamillary (BL-VMH), unilateral VMH (UL-VMH), septal area, and bilateral hypothalamic areas located dorsal, lateral, caudal and rostral to the VMH. The brain damage was nonspecific, destroying cell bodies as well as axons. The effects of these lesions were determined on food intake, body weight, abdominal adipose tissue, liver weight and fat content, and on selected endocrine gland weights. The highest food intake, obesity and liver weight and its fat content were exhibited by the BL-VMH lesioned geese. The UL-VMH and the septal lesioned geese showed moderate increase in food intake, which eventually decreased in the UL-VMH but remained constant in the septal lesioned ones. The liver fat content of the latter groups of geese was higher than the controls. No differences were found between the controls and the group of geese lesioned in the various hypothalamic areas - excluding the VMH - in all parameters measured. While no significant differences were found in pituitary, thyroid and adrenal weights among all groups of geese, a decrease in testes weight was noted in the lesioned groups of geese as compared to the controls. The interrelationships between body weight, food intake, adiposity and liver weight are discussed.

Total chicken erythrocyte histones were separated by reversed-phase h.p.l.c. using a multi-step acetonitrile gradient in a very short time (35 min). The proteins were eluted in the following order: H1, H5, H2B, H2A.2, H4, H2A.1 and H3.2. Applying a special gradient system adapted for the separation of very-lysine-rich histones, chicken erythrocyte H5 was resolved into two subfractions. Their electrophoretic mobilities were identical in both SDS and acetic acid/urea/Triton polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, but different in free-flow electrophoresis. Amino-acid-sequence analyses revealed that the two components only differ with respect to position 15, one having glutamine in that position and the other arginine. A separation of histones prepared from goose erythrocytes disclosed no H5 subfractionation. Furthermore, histones obtained from anaemic-chicken blood were analysed by the above-mentioned h.p.l.c. conditions. An alteration in the relation of H1 to H5 was detected, but no further differences in the number and quantity of the histones and histone variants were observed as compared with the corresponding proteins processed from normal-chicken blood.

The effect of norepinephrine analogue (NA) and norepinephrine antagonists on luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) secretion in geese was investigated by monitoring serum levels of LH. Twenty non-laying geese were selected and randomly assigned to 4 groups of 5 each. The geese received a single intraventricular injection of saline (control), NA (12 microg/6 microl), phentolamine (1 microg/6l) plus NA or yohimbine (10 microg/6 microl). Phentolamine, a non-selective adrenoreceptor blocker was given 5 min before NA, but yohimbine, an alpha2-adrenoreceptor blocker, was delivered without NA injection. The results showed that serum levels of LH began to increase 20 min after injection of NA, and that high serum levels of LH were maintained until 105 min, followed by a decline to the basal level 125 min later. Significantly high levels of serum LH were observed at 50 and 105 min after the injection as compared with the respective control. Treatment with phentolamine completely blocked the stimulatory effect of NA on serum levels of LH in NA treated geese. Serum levels of LH increased by yohimbine treatment 5 min after the injection and the high levels of serum LH were maintained until 125 min later. Five out of 8 points were significantly high as compared with their respective control values. The present study also suggested that there is presynaptic modulation in the a-noradrenergic neural pathways which mediate the release of LHRH, and that this modulation may be carried out by alpha2-adrenoreceptor blocker.

Six Bifidobacterium strains, i.e., Goo31D, Ham19E, Rab10A, Tam1G, Uis4E and Uis1B, were isolated from domestic goose (Anser domesticus), European hamster (Cricetus cricetus), European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), emperor tamarin (Saguinus imperator) and pygmy marmoset (Callithrix pygmaea). Cells are Gram-positive, non-motile, non-sporulating, facultative anaerobic and fructose 6-phosphate phosphoketolase-positive. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA, ITS-, multilocus- sequences and the core genome revealed that bifidobacterial strains Goo31D, Ham19E, Rab10A, Tam1G, Uis4E and Uis1B exhibit close phylogenetic relatedness with Bifidobacterium choerinum LMG 10510, Bifidobacterium hapali DSM 100202, Bifidobacterium saguini DSM 23967 and Bifidobacterium stellenboschense DSM 23968. Genotyping based on the genome sequence of the isolated strains combined with phenotypic analyses, clearly show that these strains are distinct from each of the type strains of the so far recognized Bifidobacterium species. Thus, Bifidobacterium anseris sp. nov. (Goo31D=LMG 30189T=CCUG 70960T), Bifidobacterium criceti sp. nov. (Ham19E=LMG 30188T=CCUG 70962T), Bifidobacterium imperatoris sp. nov. (Tam1G=LMG 30297T=CCUG 70961T), Bifidobacterium italicum sp. nov. (Rab10A=LMG 30187T=CCUG 70963T), Bifidobacterium margollesii sp. nov. (Uis1B=LMG 30296T=CCUG 70959T) and Bifidobacterium parmae sp. nov. (Uis4E=LMG 30295T=CCUG 70964T) are proposed as novel Bifidobacterium species.

Receptors for vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) in the goose cerebral cortex were characterized using two approaches: (1) in vitro radioreceptor binding of [(125)I]-VIP, and (2) effects of peptides from the VIP/PACAP/secretin family on cyclic AMP formation. The binding of [(125)I]-VIP to goose cortical membranes was rapid, stable, and reversible. Saturation analysis resulted in a linear Scatchard plot, suggesting binding to a single class of receptor binding sites with a high affinity (K(d)=0.76 +/- 0.13 nM) and high capacity (B(max)=70 +/- 7 fmol/mg of protein). Various peptides displaced the specific binding of 0.12 nM [(125)I]-VIP to the goose cerebral cortical membranes in a concentration-dependent manner. The relative rank order of potency of the tested peptides to inhibit [(125)I]-VIP binding to the goose cerebrum was: PACAP(38) asymptotically equal to mammalian VIP > or = PACAP(27) asymptotically equal to chicken VIP >>> PHI (peptide histidine-isoleucine) >> secretin (inactive). About 52% of specific [(125)I]-VIP binding sites in the goose cerebral cortex was sensitive to 5'-guanylimidodiphosphate [Gpp(NH)p], a nonhydrolyzable analogue of GTP. PACAP(38) and PACAP(27) potently stimulated cyclic AMP formation in the goose cerebral cortical slices in a concentration-dependent manner, displaying EC(50) values of 45.5 nM and 51.5 nM, respectively. Chicken VIP was markedly less potent than both forms of PACAP, mammalian VIP only weakly affected the nucleotide production, while effects evoked by PHI were negligible. It is concluded that the cerebral cortex of goose contains VPAC type receptors that are labeled with [(125)I]-VIP and are positively linked to cyclic AMP formation. In addition, the observed stronger action of PACAP, when compared to VIP, on cyclic AMP production in this tissue suggests its interaction with both PAC(1) and VPAC receptors.

Goose erythrocyte membranes were isolated and tested for their ability to compete with red cell receptors for vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) attachment and fusion at acidic pH. Crude membranes, solubilized with Triton X-100, Tween 80 and octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside, showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on virus binding and haemolysis. The chemical nature of the active molecules was investigated by enzyme digestion and by separation of purified components. Only the lipid moiety, specifically phospholipid and glycolipid, was found to inhibit VSV attachment; a more detailed analysis of these molecules showed that phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine and GM3 ganglioside were responsible for the inhibitory activity and could therefore represent VSV binding sites on goose erythrocyte membranes. Removal of negatively charged groups from these molecules by enzymic treatment significantly reduced their activity, suggesting that electrostatic interactions play an important role in the binding of VSV to the cell surface. Enzymic digestion of whole erythrocytes confirmed the involvement of membrane lipid molecules in the cell surface receptor for VSV.

The haemagglutinins (HAs) of five H3 influenza A viruses isolated from domestic ducks and one from a goose in southern China were analysed antigenically and genetically. The patterns of reactivity of two of the duck viruses and the goose virus with a panel of monoclonal antibodies to 10 different epitopes on the H3 HA were similar to those of influenza viruses isolated from wild ducks and pigs, as well as those of the earliest human H3 viruses. The other three isolates from domestic ducks were different from each other and from these viruses antigenically. Sequence analysis revealed that the HA genes of the two duck viruses and the goose virus were closely related to those of isolates from wild ducks and pigs; the identities between the deduced amino acid sequence of the HA of one of the isolates from domestic ducks and those of isolates from a wild duck and a pig were 98.7% and 99.5%, respectively. The antigenic and genetic similarity between these H3 HAs suggests that in southern China, the hypothetical influenza epicentre, domestic ducks may have played a role in the introduction of avian influenza viruses to pigs from feral ducks. The findings also support the hypothesis that the pig was a 'mixing vessel', producing a new human pandemic strain, A/Hong Kong/68 (H3N2), by genetic reassortment.

Bacteriologic examinations of the phallus-tissues and cloacal mucous membranes of healthy juvenile ganders showed microorganisms of the same genera or family, except Mycoplasma and Candida spp. Pathogenesis and possibilities of treating phallus-inflammations in ganders are discussed.

Up-to-date the flavivirus infection in avian taxa is not clearly defined. Several reports have demonstrated that many viruses belonging to Flaviviridae may cause diseases in poultry species; however, the susceptibility of other avian species is variable and still unclear. In human and mice, the 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) proteins are associated with resistance to the flavivirus infection as well as other virus infections. However, the avian OAS proteins are rarely studied. In our previous studies, we confirmed that the chicken OAS-like protein (chOASL) expressed OAS-enzymatic activity (the classical OAS/RNase L-dependent pathway) as well as the anti-flavivirus activity (the putative OAS/RNase L-independent pathway). Therefore, the current study aimed at functional analysis of avian OAS proteins from duck, goose, and ostrich. The duOASL, goOASL, and osOAS1 proteins expressed enzymatic activity as well as chOASL, whereas osOASL expressed little enzymatic activity. On the other hand, duOASL, goOASL, and osOASL possessed significant antiviral activity against West Nile virus (WNV)-replicon replication as well as chOASL, whereas osOAS1 did not. In addition, similar to chOASL, their antiviral activity was independent of RNase L activation. These results suggest that OASL is the only OAS protein in the duck and goose as well as chicken and possesses both OAS-enzymatic and anti-flavivirus activities, whereas the ostrich possesses both OAS1 and OASL proteins with sharing the functional activities, OAS-enzymatic and anti-flavivirus activities, respectively. It is of interest that the ostrich undergoes differential process in OAS gene evolution from other poultries and thus possesses different molecular mechanism in antiviral activity.

The effect of antigenic competition on various parameters of humoral antibody formation and cellular immunity was studied in mice. Several pairs of antigens were employed in the investigation of the competitive aspects of induction of humoral antibody formation. Induction of a primary immune response to hemocyanin in Swiss white female mice moderately suppressed the induction of both 19S and 7S antibody formation to goose or rat erythrocytes. Suppression of 7S antibody formation was maximal when a time interval of 1-3 days separated the sequence of injections, although suppression was noted for intervals of up to 14 days. The induction of a primary immune response to rat RBC, the second of the two antigens in sequence, also suppressed The induction of both 19S and 7S antibody formation to goose RBC when appropriate intervals of 1-3 days were employed between injections. The induction of a secondary immune response to rat RBC totally suppressed the primary induction of both 19S and 7S antibody formation to goose RBC administered in the appropriate time sequence. Subsequently, it was shown that the secondary immune response to the suppressed antigen (goose RBC) elicited 30 days after induction of a primary immune response (5 days after secondary immunization with rat RBC) was characterized by deficient 19S and 7S antibody production. These levels were suppressed even in comparison with a normal primary immune response to this antigen. The results were interpreted in part on the basis of a deficiency of formation of primed cells associated with immunological memory. Alternatively, evidence was obtained for the development of a split type of immunological tolerance in 6 of 10 animals studied, since a total suppression of 7S antibody production was obtained in association with deficient 19S antibody synthesis (titers < 1/10). The induction of a primary immune response to several antigens in A/J female mice suppressed the processes of cellular immunity as manifested by prolonged survival of skin grafts from C57 BL/6J female donors. These results were interpreted as evidence for the existence and utilization of processing cells by the initial immune stimulus yielding a deficiency of cells available for processing the second antigen administered in sequence.

Andes virus (ANDV) and ANDV-like viruses are responsible for most hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) cases in South America. Recent studies in Chile indicate that passive transfer of convalescent human plasma shows promise as a possible treatment for HPS. Unfortunately, availability of convalescent plasma from survivors of this lethal disease is very limited. We are interested in exploring the concept of using DNA vaccine technology to produce antiviral biologics, including polyclonal neutralizing antibodies for use in humans. Geese produce IgY and an alternatively spliced form, IgYΔFc, that can be purified at high concentrations from egg yolks. IgY lacks the properties of mammalian Fc that make antibodies produced in horses, sheep, and rabbits reactogenic in humans. Geese were vaccinated with an ANDV DNA vaccine encoding the virus envelope glycoproteins. All geese developed high-titer neutralizing antibodies after the second vaccination, and maintained high-levels of neutralizing antibodies as measured by a pseudovirion neutralization assay (PsVNA) for over 1 year. A booster vaccination resulted in extraordinarily high levels of neutralizing antibodies (i.e., PsVNA80 titers >100,000). Analysis of IgY and IgYΔFc by epitope mapping show these antibodies to be highly reactive to specific amino acid sequences of ANDV envelope glycoproteins. We examined the protective efficacy of the goose-derived antibody in the hamster model of lethal HPS. α-ANDV immune sera, or IgY/IgYΔFc purified from eggs, were passively transferred to hamsters subcutaneously starting 5 days after an IM challenge with ANDV (25 LD50). Both immune sera, and egg-derived purified IgY/IgYΔFc, protected 8 of 8 and 7 of 8 hamsters, respectively. In contrast, all hamsters receiving IgY/IgYΔFc purified from normal geese (n=8), or no-treatment (n=8), developed lethal HPS. These findings demonstrate that the DNA vaccine/goose platform can be used to produce a candidate antiviral biological product capable of preventing a lethal disease when administered post-exposure.

Thermal stabilities of chicken, grey lag goose (Anser anser), turkey as avian hemoglobins (Hbs); and human, bovine, sheep and horse as mammalian Hbs in hemolysate form were investigated and compared with oxygen affinities taken from literature. The thermal stability was obtained from thermal profiles using temperature scanning spectrophotometry. The buffer conditions were 50 mM Tris, pH 7.2, and 1 mM EDTA. The average of the inverse temperature transitions, average hydrophobicity, total van der Waals volume, partial molal volume and hydration potential were calculated by computational methods. The hemolysed avian Hbs have a lower oxygen affinity, higher thermal stability and higher self association than the mammalian Hbs. These observations are based on amino-acid composition, influence of ionic effectors, and the presence of Hb D in several avian Hbs. The results indicate that the avian Hbs have a more tense (T) conformation than the mammalian Hbs.

Bangladesh has reported repeated outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5) viruses in poultry since 2007. Because of the large number of live poultry markets (LPM) relative to the population density of poultry throughout the country, these markets can serve as sentinel sites for HPAI A(H5) detection. Through active LPM surveillance during June 2016-June 2017, HPAI A(H5N6) viruses along with 14 other subtypes of influenza A viruses were detected. The HPAI A(H5N6) viruses belonged to clade 2.3.4.4 and were likely introduced into Bangladesh around March 2016. Human infections with influenza clade 2.3.4.4 viruses in Bangladesh have not been identified, but the viruses had several molecular markers associated with potential human infection. Vigilant surveillance at the animal-human interface is essential to identify emerging avian influenza viruses with the potential to threaten public and animal health.

The aim was to search for proteins differentiating the six species (cattle, pig, chicken, turkey, duck and goose) and relatively stable during the meat aging and only slightly degraded in ready-made products. The two-dimensional electrophoresis was used for analysis of the protein profiles from raw meat and frankfurters and sausages (15 products). The observed species-specific differences in protein expression in raw meat were retained in processed products after finishing the entire technological process. Regulatory proteins, metabolic enzymes, some myofibrillar and blood plasma proteins were identified, which were characterised by the electrophoretic mobility specific to the given species. Large differences in the primary structure were observed in serum albumin, apolipoprotein B, HSP27, H-FABP, ATP synthase, cytochrome bc-1 subunit 1 and alpha-ETF. Some of these proteins have potential to be used as markers in authentication of meat products.

The objective of this research was to investigate the effects of electrical and gas stunning on the meat and liver quality characteristics of liver geese. Sixty birds were slaughtered at 12 wk of age, in groups of 20 at three different times. Thirty birds each were subjected to one of the two stunning methods. Deboned breast fillets and thigh muscles were evaluated for hemorrhaging, amount of blood in the veins, and color by using a visual grading system. Livers were removed from carcasses during evisceration and were subsequently graded. Besides external color and hemorrhaging, the degree of liver weight loss due to removal of blood vessels was also determined. The use of controlled atmosphere stunning significantly reduced the incidence of muscle hemorrhages when compared to electrical stunning. However, no significant difference was found for color or amount of blood remaining in the veins of muscles between geese receiving electrical or controlled atmosphere stunning. The hemorrhaging and color scores of livers from gas-stunned birds did not differ from those of electrically stunned birds. As for the liver weight loss caused by removal of veins and capillaries, stunning treatment had no significant effect on this parameter. These results suggest that controlled atmosphere stunning produced slightly better quality goose meat but did not improve liver quality when compared to the electrical stunning method used.

Trypsinized human group O erythrocytes were found to be a suitable alternative to gander cells in hemagglutination (HA) and hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) tests for Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus. In the HAI test, no cross-reactions against JE virus were observed with immune sera containing antibody to taxonomically related or unrelated viruses, with mouse brain antigen, or with nonantibody serum inhibitors; specific antibody rise could be detected in an immunized rabbit. Gander and trypsinized human group O cells gave comparable titers in the HAI test, but the latter were preferable since (i) they required less challenging HA antigen, being more sensitive to agglutination by JE virus, and (ii) all human and some animal sera investigated were devoid of natural agglutinins for these cells, thereby eliminating or reducing the need for prior adsorption with packed cells.

Oocysts of Eimeria stigmosa isolated from a wild juvenile lesser snow goose (Anser caerulescens caerulescens) were used in experimental infections of laboratory-reared geese. The structure of oocysts is described; a peculiar bumpy surface and a calyx-like thickening around the micropyle are illustrated by scanning electron microscopy. Experimentally infected geese had reduced feed intake and passed blood in their feces. Six days post-inoculation (p.i.) oocysts were passed for about 24 hr. Oocyst production was not increased in dexamethasone-treated geese. Complete sporulation of oocysts occurred after about 3.5 days. Developmental stages in lesser snow geese were occasionally present throughout the intestine, but were concentrated at Meckel's diverticulum, and at foci in the ileum and colon. Meronts were found 2, 3 and 4 days p.i. and gamonts and developing oocysts were observed 4, 5 and 5.5 days p.i. All endogenous stages of E. stigmosa were present in the nucleoplasm of enterocytes, primarily at the apical half of villi. Nuclear hypertrophy occurred in infected cells and nuclei containing gamonts were enlarged up to 4 times their normal size. Mild lesions were observed in the intestine of infected geese. Patent infections were established in lesser snow, Canada (Branta canadensis) and domestic (Anser anser domesticus) geese, but oocysts were not passed by inoculated ducks.

Two bluetongue virus (BTV) serotypes isolated in Australia and two selected reassortants derived from cells coinfected with these viruses have been used to identify the gene coding for the virus hemagglutinin. The parent viruses had characteristic hemagglutination patterns: BTV type 20 agglutinated sheep erythrocytes only; and BTV type 21 agglutinated sheep, bovine, human, and goose erythrocytes. Analysis of the two virus clones that had reassorted in genes coding for the outer capsid polypeptides demonstrated that hemagglutination and hemagglutination inhibition are functions associated with the outer capsid protein (VP2), which is encoded by genome segment 2.

Five new hepadnaviruses were cloned from exotic ducks and geese, including the Chiloe wigeon, mandarin duck, puna teal, Orinoco sheldgoose, and ashy-headed sheldgoose. Sequence comparisons revealed that all but the mandarin duck viruses were closely related to existing isolates of duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV), while mandarin duck virus clones were closely related to Ross goose hepatitis B virus. Nonetheless, the S protein, core protein, and functional domains of the Pol protein were highly conserved in all of the new isolates. The Chiloe wigeon and puna teal hepatitis B viruses, the two new isolates most closely related to DHBV, also lacked an AUG start codon at the beginning of their X open reading frame (ORF). But as previously reported for the heron, Ross goose, and stork hepatitis B viruses, an AUG codon was found near the beginning of the X ORF of the mandarin duck, Orinoco, and ashy-headed sheldgoose viruses. In all of the new isolates, the X ORF ended with a stop codon at the same position. All of the cloned viruses replicated when transfected into the LMH line of chicken hepatoma cells. Significant differences between the new isolates and between these and previously reported isolates were detected in the pre-S domain of the viral envelope protein, which is believed to determine viral host range. Despite this, all of the new isolates were infectious for primary cultures of Pekin duck hepatocytes, and infectivity in young Pekin ducks was demonstrated for all but the ashy-headed sheldgoose isolate.

We have been the first to investigate whether long-lived geese and ducks can detect and avoid a large offshore wind farm by tracking their diurnal migration patterns with radar. We found that the percentage of flocks entering the wind farm area decreased significantly (by a factor 4.5) from pre-construction to initial operation. At night, migrating flocks were more prone to enter the wind farm but counteracted the higher risk of collision in the dark by increasing their distance from individual turbines and flying in the corridors between turbines. Overall, less than 1% of the ducks and geese migrated close enough to the turbines to be at any risk of collision.

Susceptibility of New World waterfowl to the Lake Andes strain of duck plague virus (DPV) was assessed by intramuscular inoculation of adult muscovies (Cairina moschata), mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), Canada geese (Branta canadensis), wood ducks (Aix sponsa), redheads (Aythya americana), gadwalls (Anas strepera), blue-winged teal (Anas discors), and pintails (Anas acuta). The relative virulence of DPV strains isolated from five United States and one Canadian location was established in muscovies, mallards, and Canada geese. Differences in DPV strain virulence were detected by formation of plaques in cell culture. Two strains that consistently formed plaques killed adult mallards while non-plaque forming strains killed hatchling but not adult mallards. Based on mortality after exposure to the Lake Andes strain, blue-winged teal, then wood ducks and redheads were highly susceptible, muscovies and gadwalls moderately susceptible, mallards and Canada geese less susceptible, and pintails the least susceptible. Mean death times were significantly (P < 0.01) different between adult muscovies (4.5 days) versus mallards and Canada geese (5.8 days each). Mean death time of the virulent Lake Andes and Minnesota strains were shorter (P < 0.05) than for the other four, less virulent DPV strains. Four of the less virulent strains killed hatchling but not adult mallards. Susceptibility to mortality was dependent upon age and route of inoculation. The intramuscular route of inoculation required the least amount of virus to kill mallard and muscovy ducks, the intranasal and conjunctival routes required more virus, and the oral route the most virus. This study was conducted from 1974 to 1977 between the months of September and April, with the exception of two titrations conducted in early May at the University of Wisconsin Department of Veterinary Science and the Charmany research facility of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

This paper was aimed at following up the course of glucose in the liver of protein underfed geese. Compared to normally fed geese, liver carbohydrate metabolism in protein underfed animals can be characterised by lowering of free glucose content of in vitro glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis and reduction of carbohydrates in total oxidation. Glycogen content of the liver and rate of glucose oxidation were also lowered, but these differences were not statistically significant. Summing up our results and taking into consideration some literature data, an overall reduction of hepatic carbohydrate metabolism in protein underfed birds may be assumed.

A rapid and reliable bacterial source tracking (BST) method is essential to counter risks to human health posed by fecal contamination of surface waters. Genetic fingerprinting methods, such as repetitive sequence based-PCR (rep-PCR), have shown promise as BST tools but are time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this work, we investigate the ability of MALDI-TOF-MS to characterize and discriminate between closely related environmental strains of Escherichia coli and to classify them according to their respective sources. We compared the performance of a rapid MALDI-TOF-MS-based method to a commonly used rep-PCR-based method that employs the BOX-A1R primer. Among the criteria evaluated were repeatability and the ability of each method to group E. coli isolates according to their respective sources. Our data suggest that the MALDI-TOF-MS-based approach has a lower repeatability level compared to rep-PCR but offers an improved ability to correctly assign E. coli isolates to specific source groups. In addition, we have identified five biomarkers that appear conserved among avian species. We conclude that MALDI-TOF-MS may represent a promising, novel and rapid approach to addressing the problem of fecal contamination of surface waters and warrants further investigation.

Two hemoglobin components HbA (alpha A2 beta 2) and (alpha D2 beta 2) have been detected by analytical electrophoresis in the lysed erythrocytes of the adult Black-Headed Gull (Larus ridibundus). We report the complete primary structure of the alpha A- and beta-chains of the major hemoglobin component HbA. Following the chain separation and isolation of the tryptic peptides by RP-HPLC, the amino-acid sequence was established by automatic Edman degradation in spinning cup and gas-phase sequencers. The primary structures of alpha A- and beta-chains from the Black-Headed Gull HbA differ by 11 and by 6 amino-acid residues from the corresponding chains of Greylag Goose. These changes are randomly distributed over both alpha-helical and interhelical regions. The presence of beta/beta'-chains is indicated by the observation of Ile/Leu at position beta 78. An exchange at position beta 55 (D6)Leu-Asn which is known to be involved in the alpha 1 beta 1-interface with alpha 119(H2)Pro has been found. It is suggested that packing contacts in the alpha 1 beta 1-interface are important for high altitude respiration in birds.

Goose parvovirus (GPV), newcastle disease virus (NDV), goose herpesvirus (GHV) and goose adenovirus (GAV) are considered collectively to be four of the most important and widespread viruses of geese. Because all of these viruses cause similar pathological changes, histological differentiation among these viruses is difficult. A reliable, specific and sensitive multiplex PCR (mPCR) assay was developed for the combined detection of GPV, NDV, GHV and GAV in clinical samples of geese. Using the mPCR technique, single infections with GPV (28/76; 36.8%), NDV (9/76; 11.8%), GHV (3/76; 3.9%) and GAV (12/76; 15.8%) were identified in the samples; co-infections with GAV and either GPV or NDV (31.6%; 24/76) were also identified with this approach. The results for all of the samples tested were the same in both the uPCR and mPCR systems. The mPCR approach is considered to be useful for routine molecular diagnosis and epidemiological applications in geese.

A monoclonal antibody (MAb) against the antigenic determinant of the constant region of goose immunoglobulin light chain (GoIgCL) was produced and characterized for the first time here. Goose immunoglobulin (Ig) in serum was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography and the resulting protein was used as immunogen to immunize BALB/c mice. At the same time, the GoIgCL gene was expressed and purified as the screening antigen for selecting MAb against GoIgCL. One hybridoma that produces antibodies against GoIgCL was selected by indirect ELISA. Then the characterization of the MAb was analyzed by ELISA, Western blot, and flow cytometry. It was found to be IgG1 with κ light chain; the MAB has high specificity to Ig in goose serum, bile, and B lymphocytes from peripheral blood, reacts only with the light chain of goose Ig, and can distinguish Ig from other birds. Therefore, the MAb generated in this study can be used as a specific reagent for detection of goose disease-specific antibodies and as a powerful tool for basic immunology research on geese.

Increasingly, birds are recognised as important hosts for the ubiquitous parasite Toxoplasma gondii, although little experimental evidence exists to determine which tissues should be tested to maximise the detection probability of T. gondii. Also, Arctic-nesting geese are suspected to be important sources of T. gondii in terrestrial Arctic ecosystems, but the parasite has not previously been reported in the tissues of these geese. Using a domestic goose model, we applied a multi-scale occupancy framework to demonstrate that the probability of detection of T. gondii was highest in the brain (0.689, 95% confidence interval=0.486, 0.839) and the heart (0.809, 95% confidence interval=0.693, 0.888). Inoculated geese had an estimated T. gondii infection probability of 0.849, (95% confidence interval=0.643, 0.946), highlighting uncertainty in the system, even under experimental conditions. Guided by these results, we tested the brains and hearts of wild Ross's Geese (Chen rossii, n=50) and Lesser Snow Geese (Chen caerulescens, n=50) from Karrak Lake, Nunavut, Canada. We detected 51 suspected positive tissue samples from 33 wild geese using real-time PCR with melt-curve analysis. The wild goose prevalence estimates generated by our multi-scale occupancy analysis were higher than the naïve estimates of prevalence, indicating that multiple PCR repetitions on the same organs and testing more than one organ could improve T. gondii detection. Genetic characterisation revealed Type III T. gondii alleles in six wild geese and Sarcocystis spp. in 25 samples. Our study demonstrates that Arctic nesting geese are capable of harbouring T. gondii in their tissues and could transport the parasite from their southern overwintering grounds into the Arctic region. We demonstrate how a multi-scale occupancy framework can be used in a domestic animal model to guide resource-limited sample collection and tissue analysis in wildlife. Secondly, we confirm the value of traditional occupancy in optimising T. gondii detection probability in tissue samples.

Seasonal fluctuations in the activity of bird testes are regulated by a complex mechanism where androgens play a key role. Until recently, the role played by estrogens in males has been significantly underestimated. However, there is growing evidence that the proper functioning of the testes is associated with optimal estradiol (E2) concentration in both the plasma and testes of many mammalian species. Estrogens are gradually emerging as very important players in hormonal regulation of reproductive processes in male mammals. Despite the previously mentioned, it should be noted that estrogenic action is limited by the availability of specific receptors--estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and estrogen receptor beta (ERβ). Interestingly, there is a general scarcity of information concerning the estrogen responsive system in the testes of male birds, which is of particular interest in exploring the phenomenon of seasonality of reproduction. To address this question, we have investigated for the first time the simultaneous expression of testicular ERα and ERβ genes and proteins with the accompanying plasma and testicular E2 concentrations during the annual reproductive cycle of male bird. The research model was the domestic goose (Anser anser f. domestica), a species whose annual reproductive cycle can be divided into 3 distinct phases characterized by changes in testicular activity. It has been revealed that the stable plasma E2 profile did not correspond to changing intratesticular E2 profile throughout the experiment. The expression of ERα and ERβ genes and proteins was detected in gander testes and it fluctuated on a seasonal basis with lower level in breeding and sexual reactivation stages and higher level during the nonbreeding stage. Our results demonstrated changes in testicular sensitivity to estrogens in male domestic goose during the annual reproductive cycle. The seasonal pattern of estrogen receptors (ERs) expression was analyzed against the hormonal background and a potential mechanism of ERs regulation in bird testes was proposed. The present study revealed seasonal variations in the estrogen responsive system, but further research is needed to fully explore the role of estrogens in the reproductive tract of male birds.

Of various published theories of adaptive control of progeny sex ratio only two are plausible, a physiological theory by Trivers & Willard, and a demographic theory by Verner. The first applies to species in which sons and daughters impose different costs on parents, and in which only one or very few young are produced at once. They ought to show positive correlations in the sex of successive offspring and high sex-ratio variance among progenies. Verner's theory postulates a minimization of competition for mates in neighbourhoods subject to random fluctuation in sex ratio. Optimal progenies would exactly match the population's evolutionary equilibrium sex ratio. There would be little variance among progenies. Evidence from vertebrates is unfavourable to either theory and supports, instead, a non-adaptive model, the purely random (Mendelian) determination of sex. The apparent absence of parental control of progeny sex ratio is a serious theoretical difficulty.

Experiments have been carried out by inducing enzymatic modifications on the surface of intact cells and following the interaction between VSV and treated cells. Results obtained indicate that the removal of mannose, galactose and fucose from cell membranes reduces the attachment of the virus to cell receptors.

To elucidate this evolutionary mechanism, a reverse genetics manipulation specific for class I NDV is indispensable.

In cochlear implants (CIs), different talkers often produce different levels of speech understanding because of the spectrally distorted speech patterns provided by the implant device. A spectral normalization approach was used to transform the spectral characteristics of one talker to those of another talker. In Experiment 1, speech recognition with two talkers was measured in CI users, with and without spectral normalization. Results showed that the spectral normalization algorithm had small but significant effect on performance. In Experiment 2, the effects of spectral normalization were measured in CI users and normal-hearing (NH) subjects; a pitch-stretching technique was used to simulate six talkers with different fundamental frequencies and vocal tract configurations. NH baseline performance was nearly perfect with these pitch-shift transformations. For CI subjects, while there was considerable intersubject variability in performance with the different pitch-shift transformations, spectral normalization significantly improved the intelligibility of these simulated talkers. The results from Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrate that spectral normalization toward more-intelligible talkers significantly improved CI users' speech understanding with less-intelligible talkers. The results suggest that spectral normalization using optimal reference patterns for individual CI patients may compensate for some of the acoustic variability across talkers.

4,4'-Dinitrocarbanilide (DNC) was extracted from chicken, duck, goose, and snake eggs and isolated by reversed-phase liquid chromatography. DNC was detected by ultraviolet absorbance at 347 nm and quantitated by comparison with a calibration standard. Recoveries of DNC from fortified control chicken, duck, goose, and snake egg samples were determined for DNC levels of 0.16, 10, and 16 microg/g. The mean recoveries from chicken, duck, goose, and snake eggs were 92 +/- 4, 88 +/- 9, 87 +/- 7, and 95 +/- 6%, respectively. The method limits of detection for DNC in chicken, duck, goose, and snake eggs ranged from 0.015 to 0.035 microg/g. The reported method is much simpler than and equally efficient as previous methods developed for the determination of DNC residues in egg contents.

The mature segment gene of prolactin (PRL) in White Goose was amplified from pituitary by RT-PCR and then cloned into the pMD18-T vector. Sequencing analysis showed that the cDNA has a length of 690 bp including the termination codon and encodes a protein composed of 230 amino acids, which differs from the published PRL cDNA sequence. There is a homology of 99.57% in base and 99.56% in amino acids with that of Wanxi White Goose, respectively. A prokaryotic expression vector, pET-32a(+), was used to construct the recombinant plasmid pET-32a(+)-PRL to produce protein. Having been induced by IPTGthe host cell carrying the recombinant plasmid expressed the recombinant PRL. The optimal condition for expression is 1 mmol/L IPTG at 37. Based on this condition, the expression rose to the highest level by 4 h of induction, accounting for 28.96% of the total bacterial protein.

Hammerhead ribozyme RzF598 and its dysfunctional mutant dRzF598 targeting to the (F) gene of goose paramyxovirus SF02 have been designed. The transgenic plasmids pcDNA-RzF598 and pcDNA-dRzF598 were constructed by inserting ribozyme genes into eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3. The plasmid pcDNA3 that lacks full ribozyme gene was used as a control. Plasmids pcDNA-RzF598, pcDNA-dRzF598 and pcDNA3 were transfected into chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs). The concentration of virus released by infected CEFs and the survival percentages of CEFs were identified. The results indicated that RzF598 successfully suppressed the replication of SF02 in CEFs. Survival percentage of CEFs being transfected with pcDNA-RzF598 and infected SF02 was up to 78.8%, while the survival percentages of untransfected CEFs and CEFs transfected with pcDNA3 after infection with SF02 were only about 5%.

Marek's disease (MD) virus (MDV) is known to cause malignant lymphomas in chickens. In 2001, we first reported an MD case in a white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons) in Japan. Therefore, the prevalence of MDV in the wild geese was surveyed by nested PCR using feather-tip samples in Japan and the Far East region of Russia, breeding habitats of geese migrating to Japan. MDV was detected in about 30% of analyzed white-fronted geese. Furthermore, by nucleotide sequence analysis, we confirmed that this MDV shows high homology to very virulent MDV, suggesting that highly virulent MDV is widespread in white-fronted geese migrating between Japan and Far East region of Russia.

The presence of a social partner may significantly contribute to coping with stressful events, whereas dyadic separation generally increases glucocorticoid levels and, thereby, might also affect immune function and health. To study the covariation between social factors, immuno-reactive corticosterone metabolites, haematology and parasite product excretion patterns in a free-living, long-term monogamous bird, we separated pair mates in Greylag geese (Anser anser). We isolated the males of eight pairs for 48h to examine behavioural, adrenocortical, haematological and parasitological responses to mate removal in the female partners, and to social isolation in the males. Females showed no elevated levels of corticosterone metabolites in their droppings, but their haematocrit decreased during mate removal, whereas leucocyte number and heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio remained unchanged. In contrast, the socially isolated males excreted significantly elevated levels of corticosterone metabolites compared to baseline and showed a decrease in haematocrit as well as elevated leucocyte number and H/L ratio. In both sexes, the excretion of coccidian oocysts increased within 48h of the start of the separation, remained high one week after separation, and returned to baseline four weeks later. Described effects were generally more pronounced in males than in females. Our results suggest relatively swift potential health effects of mate loss and social isolation in an unfamiliar confinement in free-living geese.

A selective enrichment procedure, using two new selective media, was developed to isolate Pasteurella multocida from wild birds and environmental samples. These media were developed by testing 15 selective agents with six isolates of P. multocida from wild avian origin and seven other bacteria representing genera frequently found in environmental and avian samples. The resulting media--Pasteurella multocida selective enrichment broth and Pasteurella multocida selective agar--consisted of a blood agar medium at pH 10 containing gentamicin, potassium tellurite, and amphotericin B. Media were tested to determine: 1) selectivity when attempting isolation from pond water and avian carcasses, 2) sensitivity for detection of low numbers of P. multocida from pure and mixed cultures, 3) host range specificity of the media, and 4) performance compared with standard blood agar. With the new selective enrichment procedure, P. multocida was isolated from inoculated (60 organisms/ml) pond water 84% of the time, whereas when standard blood agar was used, the recovery rate was 0%.

Five avian paramyxoviruses of serotype 8 (APMV-8) were isolated during a study monitoring wild birds in Kazakhstan in 2013 and each was further characterized. The viruses were isolated from three White-fronted geese (Anser albifrons), one Whooper swan (Cygnus cygnus), and one Little stint (Calidris minuta). Before our study, only two complete APMV-8 sequences had been reported worldwide since their discovery in the USA and Japan in the 1970s. We report the complete genome sequences of the newly detected viruses and analyze the genetic evolution of the APMV-8 viruses over four decades.

The chemical characteristics of tracheal mucus obtained directly from the epithelial surface of the trachea indicate that the mucus from each animal source consists of a group of sulphated sialic acid-containing glycoproteins. Fractionation of the native glycoprotein from the cat by gel chromatography in the presence of urea and dithiothreitol suggests a value of about 3 X 10(6) for the molecular weights. The chief monosaccharide constituents are N-acetylneuraminic acid, N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine, fucose and galactose. In the goose tracheal mucin, mannose is present (serum proteins being absent). Doubly labelled cat mucus, obtained by giving Na235SO4 and [3H]glucose simultaneously into the lumen of the trachea, is massively released by parasympathetic agents, e.g. pilocarpine. The resulting mucus has a high content of 35S and is derived largely from submucosal gland cells. Subsequent exposure to an irritant, ammonia, releases a low sulphation fraction, highly labelled with 3H, arising from goblet cells. Evidence supports the view that the overall mucus is composed of mixed secretions, chemically distinct, from different cellular synthesizing sites. Differential nervous stimulation of the various sites may cause far-reaching changes in the chemical and physical properties of the mucus by selective action on the secretion of one or more of the contributing glycoproteins.

Human erythrocytes pretreated with fungal semialkali protease or trypsin became susceptible to hemagglutination by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and rabies virus. Both viruses exhibited extensive hemolytic and fusion activities against erythrocytes pretreated with these enzymes. The hemolysis and fusion were pH dependent and the activities were most apparent at pH 5.0 and decreased with increase in pH. However, VSV still exhibited slight hemolytic activity at neutral pH. Hemolysis was also dependent on the dose of virus and was inhibited by treatment of the viruses with antiviral antibody. Results of sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of erythrocyte membranes suggested that most of the carbohydrates were removed from the membrane proteins by the treatment with proteolytic enzymes.

The greylag goose (Anser anser), which lives on lowlands and cannot tolerate hypoxic conditions, presents a striking contrast to its close relative the bar-headed goose (A. indicus), which lives at high altitude and possesses high-altitude hypoxia adaptation. There are only four amino-acid residue differences at alpha18, alpha63, alpha119 and beta125 between the haemoglobins of the two species. The crystal structure of greylag goose oxy haemoglobin was determined at 3.09 A resolution. Its quaternary structure is slightly different from that of the bar-headed goose oxy haemoglobin, with a rotation of 2.8 degrees in relative orientation of the two dimers. Of the four mutations, those at alpha119 and beta125 produce contact changes in the alpha(1)beta(1) interface and may be responsible for the differences in intrinsic oxygen affinity between the two species; those at alpha18 and alpha63 may be responsible for the differences in quaternary structure between the two species.

Duck hepatitis type 1 virus (DHV-1) causes a fatal disease in ducklings but there is no report of DHV-1 isolation from goose. Recently, cases of a new disease in overfeeding geese were reported from China. The cases were characterized by haemorrhagic hepatitis lesions on liver after post mortem examinations. The flocks showed about 20-40% morbidity and less than 5% mortality. The histopathological lesions showed destroyed structure of hepatocytic tissue, severe vacuolation and necrosis of hepatocytes. Viral antigen could be detected by monoclonal antibody against duck hepatitis type 1 virus (DHV-1) in the cytoplasm of positive hepatocytes. PCR amplified viral sequences with primers specific for recent Korean-like duck hepatitis type 1 virus (DHV-1C). Alignment of the complete sequence demonstrated that the isolated JT strain from goose exhibiting 95.9% identity to DHV-1C AP-03337 strain, and only 75.3% to classical DHV-1 virus. 80% goslings developed haemorrhagic hepatitis after infection with JT strain. This is the first report on the involvement of a DHV-1 virus in goose.

The primary structure of the major hemoglobin component, HbA (alpha(A)- and beta-chain), from Tufted duck (Aythya fuligula) is presented. The separation of the globin subunits was achieved by ion exchange chromatography on CM-cellulose in 8 M urea. The amino acid sequence was determined by automatic Edman degradation of native chains as well as tryptic and hydrolytic peptides in a gas-phase sequencer. The automated homology model was generated by the protein structure modeling package WHAT IF using the crystal structure coordinates of Bar-headed goose hemoglobin. The 3D structure prediction enables alpha99Arg and beta101Glu to emerge as a new intersubunit contact site not found in the hemoglobin structure of any other species. alpha99Arg forms a complex salt bridge network involving alpha99Arg-beta101Glu-beta104Arg-beta108Asp. Also the substitution at alpha34 --> Ile, alpha38 --> Gln and beta55 --> Leu serves to stabilize the oxy-structure, leading to higher oxygen affinity.

Salmonellosis is a common food-borne illness in humans caused by Salmonella-contaminated poultry and their products. In hatcheries, 110 Salmonella isolates were identified, mostly from first enrichment, and few from delayed enrichment. The Salmonella prevalence in goose and duck hatcheries was higher when measured by four multiplex PCR methods than by traditional culture (73.8% vs. 44.35%, P < 0.05); 97.3% of 110 isolates were Salmonella Potsdam of serogroup C1 and other isolates were Salmonella Montevideo of C1 and Salmonella Albany of C2. Plasmid and pulsed field gel electrophoresis genetic analysis revealed that isolates from duck hatcheries were more diverse than those from goose hatcheries. In Salmonella Potsdam, host species-specific genotypes were observed in geese for genotypes 3, 4, and 5 and in ducks for genotypes 7, 8, and 9, suggesting that Salmonella Potsdam may evolve into goose- and duck-specific isolates. An examination of 1121 eggs found that only Salmonella Potsdam was identified in 1.8% (7/591) of eggs from chickens fed on the ground, not housed in cages, and in egg content (6/7) as well as eggshell membrane (1/7). In conclusion, Salmonella Potsdam may be a major Salmonella infection in waterfowl and chicken eggs.

Individual differences in gander Anser anser L. reaction to semen collection procedure, quality and quantity of fresh semen and its susceptibility to the freezing process are discussed. Semen was collected individually by dorso-abdominal massage, from 1-year old White Koluda ganders (n = 12) every 2-3 days. Ganders' reactions to massage were observed during the entire reproductive cycle (from 11 February to 13 June, from every male 40 semen collections were performed). For individual evaluation and freezing purpose semen was collected 13 times from every male. In the fresh semen, the following parameters were evaluated: ejaculate volume, color, density, blood or fecal contamination, motility, concentration and morphology of spermatozoa. Motility and spermatozoa morphology were evaluated in the frozen-thawed semen. Semen diluted in 2:1 ratio with EK diluent was frozen with 6% of dimethyl-formamide (DMF) to -140 degrees C at a rate 60 degrees C/min. Semen was thawed by placing the straws in a 60 degrees C water-bath for 4-5 s. Ten out of 12 ganders had from 67.5 to 100.0% positive reactions resulting in semen ejaculation. Significant (P < or = 0.01) differences in fresh semen quality of particular ganders were observed for all evaluated traits. In 1-year-old gander semen morphologically intact spermatozoa constitute only 27.8-45.2% of all cells. Therefore, the sperm quality factor (SQF), proposed by the authors, which includes ejaculate volume, sperm concentration and the percentage of live normal spermatozoa, seems to be a good predictor of gander semen fertilizing ability. The SQF of individual ganders varied from 7.7 to 11.5. The percentage of live normal spermatozoa in the frozen-thawed semen depended mainly on fresh semen quality. In relation to the fresh semen average from 57.2 to 63.2% of spermatozoa survived freezing process and from 23.9 to 38.5% remained morphologically intact.

In the present study, we investigated the oxidative biotransformation of 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47) and 2,2',4,4',5-pentabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-99) by liver microsomes from wild lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) and domesticated Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica). Formation of hydroxy-metabolites was analyzed using an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based method. Incubation of BDE-47 with avian liver microsomes produced sixteen hydroxy-metabolites, eight of which were identified using authentic standards. The major metabolites formed by liver microsomes from individual lesser snow geese were 4-hydroxy-2,2',3,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (4-OH-BDE-42), 3-hydroxy-2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (3-OH-BDE-47), and 4'-hydroxy-2,2',4,5'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (4'-OH-BDE-49). By comparison, 4-OH-BDE-42 and 4'-OH-BDE-49, but not 3-OH-BDE-47, were major metabolites of Japanese quail liver microsomes. Unidentified metabolites included monohydroxy- and dihydroxy-tetrabromodiphenyl ethers. Incubation of BDE-99 with avian liver microsomes produced seventeen hydroxy-metabolites, twelve of which were identified using authentic standards. The major metabolites formed by lesser snow goose liver microsomes were 2,4,5-tribromophenol, 3-OH-BDE-47, 4'-OH-BDE-49, 4-hydroxy-2,2',3,4',5-pentabromodiphenyl ether (4-OH-BDE-90), and 5'-hydroxy-2,2',4,4',5-pentabromodiphenyl ether (5'-OH-BDE-99). By comparison, the major metabolites produced by liver microsomes from Japanese quail included 6-hydroxy-2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (6-OH-BDE-47) and 2-hydroxy-2',3,4,4',5-pentabromodiphenyl ether (2-OH-BDE-123), but not 3-OH-BDE-47. Unidentified metabolites consisted of monohydroxy-pentabromodiphenyl ethers, monohydroxy-tetrabromodiphenyl ethers and dihydroxy-tetrabromodiphenyl ethers. Another difference between the two species was that formation rates of BDE-47 and BDE-99 metabolites were greater with liver microsomes from male than female Japanese quail, but a sex difference was not observed with lesser snow geese.

Leptin was known as a pivotal regulator for the control of food intake and energy expenditure. However, leptin has also been found to be involved in the regulation of female reproductive system through interactions with pathways in the hypothalamic-hypophyseal axis and direct action at the ovarian level. In the present study, granulosa cells from goose ovarian preovulatory (F1-F3) follicles were cultured with leptin (0, 1, 10 or 100ng/ml). The proliferative and anti-apoptotic actions of leptin in granulosa cells were revealed by CCK-8, BrdU and TUNEL assays. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analyses further indicated that leptin treatment led to increased expression of cyclin D1, cyclin D2, cyclin D3 and bcl-2, and decreased expression of p21 and caspase-3. The effects were involved in the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, as leptin treatment enhanced the expression of PI3K, Akt1, Akt2, Raptor, mTOR, S6K and p-S6K. Moreover, blockade of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway attenuated the influences of leptin on proliferation and apoptosis of granulosa cells, considering that activated factors by leptin were inhibited in the presence of either 20μM LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor) or 10μM rapamycin (an mTOR inhibitor). In addition, leptin had a modulatory effect on the expression of its receptor at the transcriptional and translational levels, and blockade of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibited both basal and leptin-induced Lepr gene and protein expression. These findings suggest that leptin exerts its proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects on goose granulosa cells through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway via interaction with its receptor.

The unusually high blood-O2 affinity in the bar-headed and Andean geese is a necessary adaptation for migration across high mountain ranges. The amino acid residues alpha-119 and beta-55, which form an alpha 1 beta 1 contact in human hemoglobin (Hb), are altered in bar-headed and Andean geese, respectively, which suggests that loss of this contact increases O2 affinity. Two mutant human Hbs with equivalent mutations at these sites prepared by site-directed mutagenesis show the same increase in O2 affinity compared with Hb A, which indicates that these mutations are responsible for the changes in the protein. The intrinsic affinity difference compared with native Hb A is amplified by organic phosphates. Whereas the recombinant and native Hbs displayed similar sensitivities to pH, chloride, and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, the oxygenation heat of the alpha-chain mutant decreased in the presence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. O2 association constants for the deoxygenated state of the alpha-mutant were about three times those for Hb A. The mutant Hb analogously exhibited higher affinity constants for binding the first three O2 molecules. Calculated heme-heme interaction energies indicated that loss of a single contact, resulting in destabilization of the deoxy (tense) structure, underlies the increased O2 affinity. Adaptations securing Hb-O2 binding at extreme altitude are discussed.

Lactobacilli are natural inhabitants of human and animal mucous membranes, including the avian gastrointestinal tract. Recently, increasing attention has been given to their probiotic, health-promoting capacities, among which their antagonistic potential against pathogens plays a key role. A study was conducted to evaluate probiotic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from feces or cloacae of domestic geese. Among the 104 examined isolates, previously identified to the species level by whole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and analysis of 16S-23S regions of rDNA, dominated Lactobacillus salivarius (35%), followed by Lactobacillus johnsonii (18%) and Lactobacillus ingluviei (11%). All lactobacilli were screened for antimicrobial activity toward Salmonella Enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Pasteurella multocida, and Riemerella anatipestifer using the agar slab method and the well diffusion method. Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus plantarum exhibited particularly strong antagonism toward all of the indicator strains. In the agar slab method, the highest sensitivity to Lactobacillus was observed in R. anatipestifer and P. multocida, and the lowest in E. coli and S. aureus. The ability to produce H₂O₂was exhibited by 92% of isolates, but there was no correlation between the rate of production of this reactive oxygen species and the antimicrobial activity of Lactobacillus sp. All lactobacilli showed resistance to pH 3.0 and 3.5 and to 2% bile. The data demonstrate that Lactobacillus isolates from geese may have probiotic potential in reducing bacterial infections. The antibacterial activity of the selected lactobacilli is mainly due to lactic acid production by these bacteria. The selected Lactobacillus strains that strongly inhibited the growth of pathogenic bacteria, and were also resistant to low pH and bile salts, can potentially restore the balance of intestinal microflora in geese and could offer an alternative to antibiotic therapy.

West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that primarily infects birds but occasionally infects humans and horses. Certain species of birds, including crows, house sparrows, geese, blue jays and ravens, are considered highly susceptible hosts to WNV. The nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of WNV can elicit protective immune responses, including NS1-reactive antibodies, during infection of animals. The antigenicity of NS1 suggests that NS1-reactive antibodies could provide a basis for serological diagnostic reagents. To further define serological reagents for diagnostic use, the antigenic sites in NS1 that are targeted by host immune responses need to be identified and the potential diagnostic value of individual antigenic sites also needs to be defined. The present study describes comprehensive mapping of common immunodominant linear B-cell epitopes in the WNV NS1 using avian WNV NS1 antisera. We screened antisera from chickens, ducks and geese immunized with purified NS1 for reactivity against 35 partially overlapping peptides covering the entire WNV NS1. This study identified twelve, nine and six peptide epitopes recognized by chicken, duck and goose antibody responses, respectively. Three epitopes (NS1-3, 14 and 24) were recognized by antibodies elicited by immunization in all three avian species tested. We also found that NS1-3 and 24 were WNV-specific epitopes, whereas the NS1-14 epitope was conserved among the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) serocomplex viruses based on the reactivity of avian WNV NS1 antisera against polypeptides derived from the NS1 sequences of viruses of the JEV serocomplex. Further analysis showed that the three common polypeptide epitopes were not recognized by antibodies in Avian Influenza Virus (AIV), Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV), Duck Plague Virus (DPV) and Goose Parvovirus (GPV) antisera. The knowledge and reagents generated in this study have potential applications in differential diagnostic approaches and subunit vaccines development for WNV and other viruses of the JEV serocomplex.

The New Jersey Meadowlands are located within the heavily urbanized New York/New Jersey Harbor Estuary and have been subject to contamination due to effluent and runoff from industry, traffic, and homes along the Hackensack River and nearby waterways. These extensive wetlands, though heavily impacted by development and pollution, support a wide array of bird and other wildlife species. Persistent contaminants may pose threats to birds in these habitats, affecting reproduction, egg hatchability, nestling survival, and neurobehavioral development. Metals of concern in the Meadowlands include arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, and mercury. These metals were analyzed in eggs, feathers, muscle, and liver of Canada geese (Branta canadensis) breeding in four wetland sites. We sampled geese collected during control culling (n=26) and collected eggs from goose nests (n=34). Levels of arsenic were below the minimum quantification level (MQL) in most samples, and cadmium and mercury were low in all tissues sampled. Chromium levels were high in feather samples. Mercury levels in eggs of Canada geese, an almost exclusively herbivorous species, were lower (mean ±SE 4.29±0.30μg/g wet weight) than in eggs of omnivorous mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), and insectivorous red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) and marsh wrens (Cistothorus palustris) from the Meadowlands, consistent with trophic level differences. However, lead levels were higher in the goose eggs (161±36.7ng/g) than in the other species. Geese also had higher levels of lead in feathers (1910±386ng/g) than those seen in Meadowlands passerines. By contrast, muscle and liver lead levels were within the range reported in waterfowl elsewhere, possibly a reflection of metal sequestration in eggs and feathers. Elevated lead levels may be the result of sediment ingestion or ingestion of lead shot and sinkers. Finally, lead levels in goose liver (249±44.7ng/g) and eggs (161±36.7ng/g) may pose a risk if consumed frequently by humans. Mill Creek, the site with the most documented prior contamination, had significantly elevated cadmium, chromium, mercury, and lead in goose tissues.

The virulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strain NA-1 (genotype VII) was isolated from an epizootic involving a flock of geese in Jilin Province, Northeast China, in 1999. Compared with the classical NDV strains, which have a genome size of 15,186 bp, the more recently isolated NDV strains, including that involved in the goose outbreak, have an extra six nucleotides in the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of the nucleoprotein (NP) gene. This extra sequence, TCCCAC, is highly conserved and has been found in multiple NDV strains, including ZJ-1, WF00G, JSG0210, and NA-1. In the current study, an infectious clone from strain NA-1 was isolated and designated rNA-1. Subsequently, strain rNA-1 was mutated to delete the six-nucleotide insertion, producing strain rNA-1(-). Virulence of the recombinant virus was then assayed in chickens and geese.

Stress responses involve autonomic, endocrine and behavioural changes. Each of these responses has been studied thoroughly in avian species, but hardly in an integrative way, in free-living birds. This is necessary to reveal the temporal dynamics of the stress response. Towards that goal, we recorded heart rate (HR) and behaviour in free-ranging male greylag geese (Anser anser) simultaneously over 2h. The geese were subjected to (a) unmanipulated control condition, (b) capture, handling and injection of ACTH, and (c) capture, handling and injection of a saline solution (SHAM). Fecal samples for the non-invasive determination of immuno-reactive glucocorticoid metabolite (BM) concentrations were collected for 7h thereafter. The SHAM control caused a significant BM increase, a transient increase in HR, an initial increase of preening behaviour and a delay in feeding. ACTH treatment, relative to SHAM, produced significantly higher BM concentrations, and activation of "displacement behaviours" such as wing flapping, body shaking and preening. Also, feeding activity as well as resting was postponed and/or lower for a longer period of time after ACTH than after SHAM. ACTH injection had a greater effect than SHAM injection on HR increase in the first hour, but particularly on HR decline in the second hour following the injection. Hence, glucocorticoids had time- and dose-dependent stimulatory and suppressive effects on cardiovascular activity and behaviour. HR dynamics after ACTH actually matched with behavioural dynamics: both were first enhanced and later suppressed, which is in alignment with adaptive stress management involving the fight-flight response and recovery from stress, respectively.

The study involved 15 avian species with 5,012 attempts to isolate Newcastle disease viruses (NDV) from their faeces over a three-year period (1977-1979). NDV were isolated from asymptomatic adult Canada geese, nestling Royal terms, a juvenile European Mute swan, and adult Tundra swans on the Eastern flyway. Ring-billed gulls were negative for haemagglutination-inhibition (HI), elution-inhibition (EI) (anti-neuraminidase) antibodies, and NDV despite 3,403 isolation attempts. The EI antibody assay used a strain isolated from a Mute swan. The prevalence of EI antibodies in the swan and geese ranged from 3-41%, while the geometric mean titre (GMT) varied from 20-36. The prevalence of HI antibodies in the swans and geese ranged from 4-62%, while the GMT varied from 16-42. In each of three years (1977-1979), the adult Mute swans had a higher HI antibody prevalence than the juveniles (P < 0.01). Among the Mute swans the HI and EI assays detected serologic conversions and persistent antibodies over the three-year period. The HI and EI assays were effective in showing differences in antibody prevalences in populations of feral birds of different species and age. The EI assay is applicable for population studies of the anti-neuraminidase antibody.

Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) is an abundant, evolutionarily conserved integral membrane protein that plays essential roles in neurotransmitter release and hormone secretion. Neurotransmitters secreted by hypothalamic neurons can alter GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormones) neuronal activity by binding to and activating specific membrane receptors in pituitary cells and, in turn, control the release of gonadotropin hormones from the pituitary gland. To reveal the influence of Syt1 on the process of goose egg-laying, we cloned and characterized the cDNA of goose Syt1 originating from hypothalamus and pituitary tissues of Huoyan goose and investigated the mRNA expression profiles during different stages of the egg-laying cycle.

Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase from the uropygial gland of goose decarboxylated (R,S)-methylmalonyl-CoA at a slow rate and introduced 3H from [3H]2O into the resulting propionyl-CoA. Carboxylation of this labeled propionyl-CoA by propionyl-CoA carboxylase from pig heart and acetyl-CoA carboxylase from the uropygial gland completely removed 3H. Repeated treatment of (R,S)-[methyl-14C]methylmalonyl-CoA with the decarboxylase converted 50% of the substrate into propionyl-CoA, whereas (S)-methylmalonyl-CoA, generated by both carboxylases, was completely decarboxylated. Radioactive (R)- (S), and (R,S)-methylmalonyl-CoA were equally incorporated into fatty acids by fatty acid synthetase from the uropygial gland. The residual methylmalonyl-CoA remaining after fatty acid synthetase reaction on (R,S)-methylmalonyl-CoA was also racemic. These results show that: (a) the decarboxylase is stereospecific, (b) replacement of the carboxyl group by hydrogen occurs with retention of configuration, (c) acetyl-CoA carboxylase of the uropygial gland generates (S)-methylmalonyl-CoA from propionyl-CoA, and (d) fatty acid synthetase is not stereospecific for methylmalonyl-CoA.

The pathogenicity of a variant goose parvovirus (GPV), isolated from short beak and dwarfism syndrome of Pekin ducks (strain Cherry Valley), was investigated in embryonating goose eggs and goslings. The virus was easily grown in GPV antibody-free goose embryos and caused high mortality and severe lesions of goose embryos, indicating that the variant GPV has good adaptation and high pathogenicity to embryonated goose eggs similar to the classical GPV. Like the third egg-passage virus (strain H) of a classical GPV, the third egg-passage virus (strain JS1) of the variant GPV caused Derzsy's disease in 2-day-old goslings with high mortality. The findings suggest that the variant GPV strain, which had specifically adapted to Pekin ducks, still retained high pathogenicity for its original host. The mortality (73.3-80%) caused by the first and third egg-passages of the variant GPV was somewhat lower than that (93.3%) caused by the third passage virus of the classical GPV, reflecting the higher pathogenicity of the classical GPV for its original host. These findings are likely to reinforce the importance of surveillance for parvoviruses in different waterfowl species and stimulate further study to elucidate the impact of mutations in the GPV genome on its pathogenicity to goslings and ducks.

Immunohistochemistry, the standard method for diagnosing amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis, is limited in animals because it requires a large array of animal-specific anti-AA antibodies, not commercially available. The Shtrasburg method (SH method) is a highly specific and sensitive technique, helping in the diagnosis and determination of AA amyloidosis in humans. The aim of this study is to determine whether the SH method is applicable in the diagnosis of AA amyloidosis in a variety of animals. Tissue samples were obtained from animals suffering from spontaneous or experimentally induced AA amyloidosis (mice, hamsters, guinea pigs, cheetahs, cats, cows, ducks, a dog, a goose, a chicken, and a turaco). Detection of the amyloid and quantitative evaluation were performed using Congo red staining, and specific AA typing was performed by the potassium permanganate technique. The studied tissues were subjected to the SH method, which confirmed the AA nature of the amyloid deposit, by displaying in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis protein bands consistent with the molecular weight of the species-specific AA, in all the animals examined, except mice, hamsters, and guinea pigs. N-terminal analysis of these bands corroborated their AA origin. We conclude that the SH method may be used as an ancillary simple tool for the diagnosis of AA amyloidosis in a large number of domestic and wild animals. Moreover, our findings further increase the feasibility of applying this method in humans.

Numbers of nonmigratory Canada geese have increased substantially in the past decade, and they have become a nuisance in some urban areas. Because of their close contact with humans in parks and areas adjacent to surface waterways, contact with their feces poses a zoonotic risk. A total of 97 geese from 10 separate geographic locales in the greater Boston area had their feces sampled for detection of Helicobacter spp. Identification of Helicobacter spp. based on 16S rRNA genus-specific helicobacter primers was noted in 39 of 97 (40.2%) DNA fecal extracts. Twenty-seven (27.8%) of these geese had helicobacters isolated from their feces. A urease-positive novel species, Helicobacter anseris, based on phenotypic, biochemical, and 16S rRNA analyses, was isolated from 20 geese from seven different flocks. A second, novel, urease-negative Helicobacter sp., H. brantae, was identified in seven geese. Four geese had both novel Helicobacter spp. cultured from their feces. Whether these two novel helicobacters pose a zoonotic risk, similar to other enteric helicobacters (e.g., H. canadensis, previously isolated from diarrheic and bacteremic humans and from geese in Europe), will require further studies.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that are vital to activation of the innate immune system in response to invading pathogens through their recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). TLR5 is responsible for the recognition of bacterial flagellin in vertebrates. In this study, we cloned the goose TLR5 gene using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The open reading frame (ORF) of goose TLR5 cDNA is 2583 bp in length and encodes an 860 amino acid protein. The entire coding region of the TLR5 gene was successfully amplified from genomic DNA and contained a single exon. The putative amino acid sequence of goose TLR5 consisted of a signal peptide sequence, 11 leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, a leucine-rich repeat C-terminal (LRR-CT) domain, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular Toll-interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain. The amino acid sequence of goose TLR5 shared 50.5% identity with human (Homo sapiens), 49.8% with mouse (Mus musculus) and 82.7% with chicken (Gallus gallus). The goose TLR5 gene was highly expressed in the spleen, liver and brain; moderately expressed in PBMCs, kidney, lung, heart, bone marrow, small intestine and large intestine; and minimally expressed in the cecum. HEK293 cells transfected with goose TLR5 and NF-κB-luciferase containing plasmids significantly responded to flagellin from Salmonella typhimurium indicating that it is a functional TLR5 homologue. In response to infection with S. enterica serovar Enteritidis (SE), the level of TLR5 mRNA significantly increased over the control in PBMCs at 1 d post infection (p.i.) and was slightly elevated in the spleen at 1 d or 3 d p.i. IL-6 was expressed below control levels in PBMCs but was upregulated in the spleen. In contrast to IL-6, an evident decrease in the expression level of IL-8 was observed in both PBMCs and spleens at 1 d or 3 d p.i. SE challenge also resulted in an increase in the mRNA expression of IL-18 and IFN-γ in PBMCs and the spleen. These results imply that the expression of goose TLR5 is differentially regulated in various tissues and may participate in the immune response against bacterial pathogens.

Competition models including competition for light predict that small plant species preferred by herbivores will be outshaded by taller unpreferred plant species with increasing productivity. When the tall plant species is little grazed by the herbivores, it can easily invade and dominate short vegetation. The tall-growing grass Elymus athericus dominates the highly productive stages of a salt-marsh succession in Schiermonnikoog and is not preferred by the herbivores which occur there, hares and geese. We studied how interspecific competition and herbivory affected performance during early establishment of this species with increasing productivity. Seedlings were planted in the field in a full factorial design, manipulating both interspecific competition and herbivory. The experiment was replicated along a natural productivity gradient. Competition reduced above-ground biomass production and decreased the number of ramets that were produced but did not affect survival of seedlings. The negative effects of competition on seedling performance increased with increasing productivity. In contrast to our expectations, herbivory strongly reduced seedling survival, especially at the unproductive sites and had only small effects on seedling growth. The present study shows that unpreferred tall-growing species cannot easily invade vegetation composed of short preferred species. Grazing by (intermediate-sized) herbivores can prevent establishment at unproductive sites, and increased competition can prevent a rapid invasion of highly productive sites. Herbivores can have a long-lasting impact on vegetation succession by preventing the establishment of tall-growing species, such as E. athericus, in a window of opportunity at young unproductive successional stages.

The cloacal cestode Cloacotaenia megalops is one of the most common helminths of waterfowl. We investigated the effect of this parasite on the body condition of wintering waterfowl populations and compared prevalence among age-sex classes, over time and between habitat types on the upper Gulf Coast of Texas (USA) from October 1986-February 2000. Greater than 9,500 birds of 25 waterfowl species were examined for the parasite. There was no statistical difference (P > 0.05) in body condition between birds with and without the parasite. Average prevalence was lowest for geese (mean = 3.7%) versus 21 to 71% in duck species. Average prevalence was similar (P = 0.81) between diving ducks (mean = 46.9%) and puddle ducks (mean = 43.9%). Prevalence varied among age-sex classes and was related to sex rather than age. Variation among age-sex classes suggests differences in diet between sexes of duck species on the wintering grounds. There was no evidence for declining prevalence over the wintering period. Prevalence differed (P < 0.05) between collection sites, and thereby habitat types, for several species. Temporal trends indicate stable prevalence of C. megalops for diving ducks and increasing prevalence for puddle ducks. The increasing trend for puddle ducks may indicate declining habitat conditions resulting in increased exposure to the intermediate ostracod host.

Salmonella contamination is a major problem in the poultry industry, but no data are available on the prevalence in geese. From two slaughter facilities in Manitoba, 130 carcass rinsings and 315 cloacal swabs from a total of 17 flocks of domestic geese were examined for salmonellae. Sixty percent of the carcass rinsings and 18.4% of the cloacal swabs were positive. Most of the isolates were serotyped, and some analysis of the results is presented. Three culture media were compared, and a modified dulcitol brilliant-green novobiocin medium was found to be more selective than brilliant-green and brilliant-green sulfa agars.

We examined whether forelimb and hindlimb phasic afferent input is a prerequisite for the production of avian locomotor patterns. We eliminated phasic afferent feedback through paralysis of a decerebrate animal. The term "fictive" has been used to describe the neural activity associated with spontaneous or evoked motor output during neuromuscular paralysis. We observed that a paralysed decerebrate bird is capable of producing similar locomotor activity patterns as an unparalysed preparation, regardless of whether the "fictive" locomotion is generated spontaneously, or in response to focal electrical and/or neurochemical stimulation of discrete brainstem locomotor regions. Not all aspects of "fictive" locomotor patterns were identical to the locomotion elicited prior to paralysis. The stimulus current threshold necessary to evoke hindlimb locomotion increased from 69 +/- 22 mu A (mean +/- S.D.) prior to paralysis to 185 +/- 87 mu A for "fictive" stepping. For wing activity, the threshold increased from 84 +/- 46 mu A during wing flapping to 228 +/- 148 mu A for "fictive" flight. In addition, the frequency of "fictive" efferent locomotor activity from the leg nerve (1.04 +/- 0.44 Hz) decreased relative to the frequency of leg activity prior to paralysis (1.55 +/- 0.70 Hz). Similarly, the frequency of wing activity decreased from 2.73 +/- 0.73 Hz before paralysis to 1.8 +/- 0.69 Hz after paralysis. Finally flexor burst duration remained constant during treadmill and "fictive" walking while the extensor burst duration was markedly increased during "fictive" walking. Thus, the relative contributions of leg flexor activity to the overall step cycle (burst proportion = burst duration/cycle duration) decreased during evoked "fictive" stepping, while the burst proportion of the leg extensor increased. Afferent feedback therefore appears to modulate leg extensor burst duration more than leg flexor duration. For the wings, the burst proportion of the major wing depressors remained constant before and after paralysis.

Avian cholera was diagnosed in lesser snow geese (Anser c. caerulescens), Ross' geese (Anser rossii) and individuals of several other waterfowl species in a small area of south-western Saskatchewan over a 1 month period during the 1977 spring migration. Approximately 250 dead birds were found. This is apparently the first time avian cholera has been reported in migrating waterfowl in Canada. The site of the mortality was midway between the wintering and nesting areas of the two principal species, and the significance of the occurrence of the disease this far north is discussed.

On the basis of a partial N-terminal sequence, Jollès and Jollès previously proposed that the lysozyme from the starfish Asterias rubens represents a new form of lysozyme, called type i (invertebrate) lysozyme. Indeed, it differed from both the types c (chicken) and g (goose) known in other animals, as well as from plant and phage lysozymes. Recently, several proteins belonging to the same family have been isolated from protostomes. Here we report the complete mature protein sequence and cDNA sequence of the lysozyme from Asterias. These sequences vindicate the previously proposed homology between the starfish, a deuterostome, and protostome lysozymes. In addition, we present a structural analysis that allows us to postulate upon the function of several conserved residues.

During the second half of 2005, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus spread rapidly from central Asia to eastern Europe. The relative roles of wild migratory birds and the poultry trade are still unclear, given that little is yet known about the range of virus hosts, precise movements of migratory birds, or routes of illegal poultry trade. We document and discuss the spread of the HPAI H5N1 virus in relation to species-specific flyways of Anatidae species (ducks, geese, and swans) and climate. We conclude that the spread of HPAI H5N1 virus from Russia and Kazakhstan to the Black Sea basin is consistent in space and time with the hypothesis that birds in the Anatidae family have seeded the virus along their autumn migration routes.

In response to overfeeding for the production of "foie gras," the Poland goose differs from the Landes goose by a lesser susceptibility to hepatic steatosis, resulting in a lower accumulation of hepatic triacylglycerol (TG), together with a greater exportation of hepatic phospholipid (PL) in very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and high density lipoproteins (HDL) (Fournier et al., 1997). A study was designed 1) to compare the liver composition in overfed and nonoverfed geese of the two breeds of geese and 2) to determine whether the differential channelling of lipids in response to overfeeding is reflected in the PL and fatty acid profiles of the different hepatic lipids, whether stored or secreted. In nonoverfed geese, there were no breed-related differences in liver weight (approximately 90 to 100 g), hepatic lipid content (3 to 4%), and lipid and PL composition. However, plasma VLDL and HDL of the Landes breed contained a higher phosphatidylcholine (PC) to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) ratio than those of the Poland breed (20.7 and 33.8 vs 12.6 and 25.6 in VLDL and HDL, respectively). After 14 d of overfeeding, hepatic PL profiles were identical in the two breeds and similar to that in control livers; choline-containing PL accounted for 95% of total PL. In contrast, plasma HDL concentrations of the Landes geese were lower than those of the Poland geese (9.4 vs 12.9 g/L) and their PC:PE (13.6%) and PL-polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) content (25%) were decreased compared with the Poland geese (21.2 and 30%). It is likely that the higher susceptibility to fatty liver of the Landes breed involves a differential channelling of PL, resulting in a greater hepatic retention of PC and PUFA that are necessary for plasma membrane growth and cell hypertrophy.

Goose erythrocytes were agglutinated by five strains of rabies virus grown in monolayer cell cultures at pH 6.4 and at 0 to 4 C. Hemagglutination was not affected by the cell type in which the virus was grown. Prerequisites for occurrence of hemagglutination are absence of hemagglutination inhibitors (such as those contained in bovine serum) and a relatively high virus concentration (> 10(6) plaque-forming units of virus per ml). "Soluble" hemagglutinin was not present in crude preparations of extracellular virus. Treatment of purified preparations of extracellular virus with Tween 80 and ether did not result in release of a "soluble" hemagglutinin. The hemagglutinating property of extracellular virus seemed to be conditioned by the integrity of its coat. Preparations of infectious intracellular virus exhibited about 15 times lower hemagglutinating activity than extracellular virus. This decreased hemagglutinating activity did not seem to be caused by binding of hemagglutination inhibitors to the virus particles. Rabies virus can be quantitatively adsorbed onto and eluted from erythrocytes. Erythrocytes pretreated with rabies virus retained their ability to be agglutinated by the same virus strain. The reaction with rabies virus of erythrocytes treated with the receptor-destroying enzyme or KIO(4) was the same as that of nontreated erythrocytes. The hemagglutinating component of rabies virus, therefore, does not exhibit neuraminidase activity. Treatment of extracellular virus by various agents indicated that the hemagglutinating component consists of protein or lipoprotein. Sulfhydryl groups present in the viral hemagglutinin are essential for hemagglutination.

A systematic study was made of certain variables of the rubella hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test system and their effect on antigen and antibody titers. Erythrocytes from pigeons and 1-day-old chicks gave similar antigen and antibody titers, but goose erythrocytes gave lower titers. Indicator erythrocytes could be stored in Alsever's solution at 4 C for as long as 2 weeks without losing sensitivity in hemagglutination (HA) and HI tests. Antigen titers varied by eightfold or more in different diluent systems; titers were generally higher at pH 6.2 than at pH 7.2. A diluent without Ca(2+) gave antigen titers as high as those obtained in diluents with added Ca(2+) ions. Antibody titers also varied in different diluent systems. HEPES diluents at pH 6.2 gave higher antibody titers than those obtained in other diluents, but occasional "false-positive" inhibition reactions were seen. Kaolin suspended in borate saline at pH 9.0 effectively removed inhibitor from sera without absorbing specific antibody, but at pH 7.3 it removed various amounts of specific antibody. Antibody titers of sera treated with kaolin at pH 9.0 were similar to those of sera treated with heparin-MnCl(2); treatment with dextran sulfate-CaCl(2) gave lower antibody titers. Antigens varied widely in sensitivity for detecting HI antibody and in the ability to detect diagnostically significant increases in antibody. Sensitivity in detecting antibody was not related to the HA titer of the antigens. Tween-ether-treated antigens gave lower antibody titers but were more reliable than corresponding untreated antigens for serological diagnosis of infection.

Surveillance for avian influenza A viruses in wild bird populations is often limited by requirements for a cold chain from time of specimen collection, by availability of ultra-low temperature specimen storage within a few hours or days, and by laborious classical virologic procedures. Successful storage of specimens in preservatives at ambient temperature and subsequent detection of RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) would assist in helping influenza surveillance efforts become more widespread in remote areas, as well as more timely and inexpensive. Here, we describe bird feces spiked with influenza A virus preserved with guanidine and commercial buffers or alcohols at ambient temperature and analyzed by RT-PCR protocols. Virus-specific RT-PCR products of, at most, 206 bp were recovered for samples preserved with alcohols and up to 521 bp for samples preserved with guanidine or commercial buffers. These results suggest that this approach is feasible in the field and that preserved specimens might be better assayed molecularly when preserved in guanidine or commercial buffers.

Baseline research on the toughness of Egyptian goose meat is required. This study therefore investigates the post mortem pH and temperature decline (15 min-4 h 15 min post mortem) in the pectoralis muscle (breast portion) of this gamebird species. It also explores the enzyme activity of the Ca(2+)-dependent protease (calpain system) and the lysosomal cathepsins during the rigor mortis period.

In this study, the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of the Yanling white goose was reported in Human Province first, which was determined through PCR-based method. The total length of the mitogenome is 16,742 bp. It contains the typical structure, including 2 ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, 13 protein-coding genes and 1 non-coding control region (D-loop region) as that of most other vertebrates. The overall composition of the mitogenome was estimated to be 30.22% for A, 22.70% for T, 32.02% for C and 15.07% for G. All the protein initiation codons are ATG, except for COX1, COX2 and ND5 are GTG, ND6 is CTA. The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of the Yanling white goose in Human Province provides an important data set for the study in genetic mechanism of poultry.

This report describes an outbreak of botulism occurred among a free-living population of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and geese (Anser anser) in an urban park. Mortality rate among investigated population was 86,8% (118 dead out of 136). Twenty-seven carcasses were collected for macroscopic examination and screened for microbiological, virological, toxicological investigations. A sick mallard was captured and neurological symptoms were observed. No causative agent of viral avian diseases was found in the examined animals and screening for environmental neurotoxic substances proved negative as well. In contrast, microbiological cultures from specimens tested positive for botulinum toxin-producing clostridia. Blood serum and fecal extract of the sick mallard proved positive for botulinum neurotoxin in the standard mouse protection test using reference Clostridium botulinum type C antitoxin. Gene content of cultured strains showed a mosaic composition of bont/C and bont/D sequences, defining them as type C/D chimeric organisms.

Three H5N8 avian influenza viruses isolated from domestic geese in China in 2014 were characterized phylogenetically and biologically. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genomic sequences of the three isolates from this study and those of 61 other H5N8 viruses retrieved from the GISAID platform indicated that, chronologically and geographically, all H5N8 viruses of the Asian H5N1 HA lineage of clade 2.3.4.4 are the direct descendents of the K1203 (H5N8)-like viruses first isolated in China in 2010. The three viruses from this study shared high sequence similarity in all eight gene segments with three other isolates from China in 2013, and two Korean isolates were distinct from the recently circulating reassortants causing outbreaks in Asia, Europe and the United States in 2014 and 2015. In vitro viral growth curves indicated that these H5N8 viruses replicated to high titers in CEF, DEF, MDCK and A549 cells but to significantly lower titers in Vero cells. Pathogenicity studies in vivo indicated that these viruses were all highly virulent to chickens and mallard ducks, while they varied from moderate to high virulence in mice. Additionally, hemagglutination assays using α-2,3-sialidase-treated goose red blood cells and solid-phase direct binding assays with different glycans demonstrated that the three viruses could bind to both avian-type SAα-2,3Gal and human-type SAα-2,6Gal receptors. Our findings confirmed the progenitor nature of the K1203-like viruses in generating recent prevalent clade 2.3.4.4 H5N8 reassortants, which have caused tremendous damage to the poultry industry and are a potential threat to public health.

This research validates a novel approach for source tracking based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of DNA extracted from Escherichia coli isolates. Escherichia coli from different animal sources and from river samples upstream from, at, and downstream of a combined sewer overflow were subjected to DGGE to determine sequence variations within the 16S-23S intergenic spacer region (ISR) of the rrnB ribosomal operon. The ISR was analyzed to determine if E. coli isolates from various animal sources could be differentiated from each other. DNA isolated from the E. coli animal sources was PCR amplified to isolate the rrnB operon. To prevent amplification of all 7 E. coli ribosomal operons by PCR amplification using universal primers, sequence-specific primers were utilized for the rrnB operon. Another primer set was then used to prepare samples of the 16S-23S ISR for DGGE. Comparison of PCR-DGGE results between human and animal sources revealed differences in the distribution and frequency of the DGGE bands produced. Human and Canada Goose isolates had the most unique distribution patterns and the highest percent of unique isolates and were grouped separately from all other animal sources. Method validation suggests that there are enough host specificity and genetic differences for use in the field. Field results at and around a combined sewer overflow indicate that this method can be used for microbial source tracking.

A novel disease entity in domestic geese with unusual epidemiology and pathological changes has emerged in some regions of China since the late 1990s. Velogenic Newcastle disease (ND) viruses were isolated from visceral organs and cloacal swabs of diseased birds in the field. Gross lesions of diseased geese were characterized by extensive necrotic foci in intestinal mucosa, spleen and pancreas. Histological examination revealed multisystemic distribution of lesions. Similar disease was reproduced experimentally in geese not only with two field isolates of goose origin, but also with ND viruses belonging to genotypes VI, VII, VIII and IX. These led us to define the novel disease as clinical ND in geese. Additionally, the goose-originated ND virus isolates could be transmitted from geese to specific pathogen free chickens, illustrating the potential threat they posed to the chicken industry. This is the first detailed report of the natural outbreaks and experimental reproduction of ND in geese, providing evidence that geese could play an important role in the epidemiology of ND.

The antigenic relatedness of minute virus of mice (MVM), Kilham rat virus (KR), H-1 virus (H-1), haemorrhagic encephalopathy of rats virus (HER), porcine parvovirus (PPV), canine parvovirus (CPV), feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), goose parvovirus (GPV) and bovine parvovirus (BPV) was studied by immunofluorescence microscopy (FA) and by serum neutralization (SN). An antigenically related group comprising MVM, KR, HER, PPV, CPV and FPV was recognized by FA and most reactions within the group were reciprocal. Antigenic relatedness was less evident when the same viruses and antisera were tested by SN. Only CPV and FPV were closely and reciprocally related. Other cross-reactions by SN were quantitatively minor and included neutralization of CPV and FPV by pig anti-PPV serum and neutralization of H-1 and HER by rat anti-KR serum. Neither FA nor SN revealed any antigenic relationship of BPV and GPV either with each other or with any of the other viruses tested.

Haemoglobin from the bar-headed goose (Anser indicus) has higher oxygen affinity than that from its lowland relatives such as greylag goose (A. anser). The crystal structure of bar-headed goose aquomet haemoglobin was determined at 2.3 A resolution and compared with the structures of the goose oxy, human, horse and other avian haemoglobins and the sequences of other avian haemoglobins. Four amino-acid residues differ between greylag goose and bar-headed goose haemoglobins, among which Alaalpha119 and Aspbeta125 in bar-headed goose haemoglobin reduces the contacts between the alpha(1) and beta(1) subunits compared with Pro and Glu, respectively, and therefore may increase the oxygen affinity by loosening the alpha(1)beta(1) interface. Compared with human oxy haemoglobin, the relative orientation of two alphabeta dimers in the bar-headed goose aquomet and oxy Hbs are rotated by about 4 degrees, indicating a unique quaternary structural difference from the typical R state. This new 'R(H)' state is probably correlated with the higher oxygen affinity of bar-headed goose haemoglobin.

The structure of the avian lymph node (ALN) is characterized by a thin capsule, thin lymphoreticular cords, and an absence of trabeculae. It is not possible to subdivide the ALN into cortex, paracortex and medulla, or to subdivide the system of sinuses into marginal, trabecular and medullary divisions. The lymphoreticular cords contain avian germinal centers (AGC) with B-lymphocytes and the area of T-lymphocytes. Postcapillary venules are responsible for the recirculation of lymphocytes. Sinus reticular cells do not exist in the ALN, but free macrophages are present. The phagocytic capacity of the macrophages was determined by injection of vital dyes (India ink, Berlin blue) and inoculation with Candida cells. Macrophages filled with markers migrate from the lymph sinuses into the lymphoreticular cords and further into the AGC. The mobility of the macrophages is remarkably lower after phagocytosis of Candida cells.

1. The composition of the nasal salt-glands of geese was found to be Na 57 +/- 3.5 (S.E.), K 52.3 +/- 3.9 and Cl 78.3 +/- 11.0 m-equiv/kg fresh tissue. During secretion, the Na content was significantly raised to 72.4 +/- 3.4 m-equiv/kg.2. Salt-gland slices incubated in Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate medium plus glucose (6 mM), in the presence of [(14)C]sucrose as an extracellular marker had the following composition, Na 85.3 +/- 3.1, K 37.1 +/- 3.1 and Cl 74.3 +/- 3.6 m-equiv/kg. The calculated intracellular concentrations were for Na 61.5 +/- 2.1, K 105.3 +/- 8.7 and Cl 37.8 +/- 5.0 m-equiv/l. intracellular water.3. Ouabain (10(-4)M) significantly decreased the tissue and cell K concentration and significantly increased the Na concentration.4. Acetylcholine (10(-6)M) and eserine (10(-4)M) in the incubation medium had no effect on intracellular composition.5. Raising the Na concentration of the medium to 172 m-equiv/l. and the Cl to 156 m-equiv/l. in two experiments had no effect on the calculated intracellular composition.6. These results do not support reports that the cells have a very high Na concentration (about 350 m-equiv/l. intracellular water). They are compatible with the hypothesis that the hypertonic secretion is formed across the luminal membrane of the secretory cell by an active Na(+) pump and there are no data to suggest that Na(+) is concentrated across the basal membrane by a ouabain-insensitive process.7. The data are discussed in relation to permeability studies and to electrical potential measurements within the gland by other workers.

Mononucleosomes prepared from goose erythrocyte nuclei exhibited limited heterogeneity with respect to number of electrophoretic components, histones and DNA composition. The components differ slightly in ionic strength induced self-association. Thermal denaturation of each component gave only two dominant, highly cooperative, melting transitions, T" and T"'. Urea and trypsin were used to establish the differential lability of these two transitions. Comparison of the morphologies of the mononucleosomes at various stages throughout the melting profile indicated that the 13.3 +/- 1.5 nm diameter mononucleosomes start to disrupt only in the latter half of transition T" and do not unfold until after reaching T"'. The resultant, open ended (17.4 +/- 2.2 nm diameter) toroids are still largely negatively staining and much more uniform in shape if fixed simultaneously with gluteraldehyde.

Twenty-four 10-day-old, artificially reared, coccidia-free goslings (Anser cygnoides var. domestica) were inoculated orally with 1.0x10(5)-1.0x10(6) sporulated oocysts of Eimeria nocens, and killed at intervals from 30 to 336 hr postinoculation (PI). Parts of the visceral organs, including intestines, kidney, liver, gallbladder, and spleen from inoculated goslings, were fixed and sectioned. The life cycle of E. nocens and histologic changes during infection were examined microscopically. The results showed that at least 3 generations of meronts developed in the endogenous stage of the life cycle of E. nocens. Two types of meronts were found. The first completed maturation at 54 to 78 hr PI. These meronts were the first generation, with each forming about 12 merozoites. The second completed maturation at 102 to 240 hr PI. These meronts were the second or third generations, with each meront forming about 24 merozoites. Development of gamonts began at about 198 hr after infection. The prepatent period was 9 days and discharge of oocysts continued for 4 days. Sporulation of oocysts occurred in 60-72 hr at 25 C. Eimeria nocens invaded the posterior jejunum, ileum, caecum, rectum, and cloaca. Developmental stages were localized within the epithelial cells of villi and crypts, and in lamina propria. Marked histological changes, including desquamation and necrosis of intestinal epithelium, submucosal edema, hemorrhages, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and villous atrophy, were seen during the periods of late merogony, gamogony, and oocyst shedding. They were most pronounced in the ileum and the regions nearby. The infected goslings showed severe diarrhea, bloody feces, anorexia, emaciation, and even death, suggesting that E. nocens is highly pathogenic for goslings.

Duck plague virus (DPV) is a virus of the Herpesviridae family that leads to acute disease with a high mortality rate in ducks. Control of the disease contributes to the development of poultry breeding. Type III IFN family (IFN-λs) is a novel member of the IFN family, and goose IFN-λ (goIFN-λ) is a newly identified gene whose antiviral function has only been investigated to a limited extent. Here, the cross-species antiviral activity of goIFN-λ against DPV in duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs) was studied. We found that pre-treatment with goIFN-λ greatly increased the expression of IFN-λ in both heterologous DEFs and homologous goose embryo fibroblasts (GEFs), while differentially inducing IFNα- and IFN-stimulated genes. Additionally, a positive self-regulatory feedback loop of goIFN-λ was blocked by a mouse anti-goIFN-λ polyclonal antibody, which was confirmed in both homologous GEFs and goose peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The suppression of the BAC-DPV-EGFP by goIFN-λ in DEFs was confirmed by ﬂuorescence microscopy, flow cytometry (FCM) analysis, viral copies and titre detection, which can be rescued by mouse anti-goIFN-λ polyclonal antibody incubation. Finally, reporter gene assays indicated that the cross-species antiviral activity of goIFN-λ against BAC-DPV-EGFP is related to its positive self-regulatory feedback loop and subsequent ISG induction. Our data shed light on the fundamental mechanisms of goIFN-λ antiviral function in vitro and extend the considerable range of therapeutic applications in multiple-poultry disease.

The highly repetitive DNA sequence of centromeric heterochromatin is an effective molecular cytogenetic marker for investigating genomic compartmentalization between macrochromosomes and microchromosomes in birds. We isolated four repetitive sequence families of centromeric heterochromatin from three Anseriformes species, viz., domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos, APL), bean goose (Anser fabalis, AFA), and whooper swan (Cygnus cygnus, CCY), and characterized the sequences by molecular cytogenetic approach. The 190-bp APL-HaeIII and 101-bp AFA-HinfI-S sequences were localized in almost all chromosomes of A. platyrhynchos and A. fabalis, respectively. However, the 192-bp AFA-HinfI-L and 290-bp CCY-ApaI sequences were distributed in almost all microchromosomes of A. fabalis and in approximately 10 microchromosomes of C. cygnus, respectively. APL-HaeIII, AFA-HinfI-L, and CCY-ApaI showed partial sequence homology with the chicken nuclear-membrane-associated (CNM) repeat families, which were localized primarily to the centromeric regions of microchromosomes in Galliformes, suggesting that ancestral sequences of the CNM repeat families are observed in the common ancestors of Anseriformes and Galliformes. These results collectively provide the possibility that homogenization of centromeric heterochromatin occurred between microchromosomes in Anseriformes and Galliformes; however, homogenization between macrochromosomes and microchromosomes also occurred in some centromeric repetitive sequences.

The objective of this experiment was to test effects of different dietary lipids in rainbow trout feeding on the activity and expression of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione S-transferase (GST). Four iso-nitrogenous and iso-lipidic casein-gelatin based experimental diets were formulated. The sources of dietary lipids were cod liver oil (CO, rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids), goose fat (GF, rich in saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids), soybean oil (SO, rich in linoleic acid), and a blend of CO, GF and SO. Dietary treatments had no significant effect on growth performance and survival was not affected. SOD, GPx and GST enzymes had the maximum activity in GF diet. However qPCR data showed that SOD and GPx mRNA levels were minimum in GF group. Overall data showed that rainbow trout liver enzymes were activated upon GF diet probably activating the enzyme structure itself without stimulating gene expression.

Mycobacterium avium is an important veterinary pathogen causing avian tuberculosis in birds. The aim of the study was to evaluate the genetic relatedness in M. avium isolates from deep tissues of farmed lesser white-fronted geese with avian tuberculosis and in samples from the farm environment. The strains were analyzed by two PCR-based typing methods, inverted repeat (IR) typing and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. The primers for the inverted repeats of the insertion sequences IS1245 and IS1311 were used in IR typing, and the RAPD analysis was performed with six primers. Seven of the nine avian strains yielded an identical pattern in the IR typing, but they could be divided into two groups in the RAPD analysis. The remaining two bird isolates had an identical IR pattern (IR cluster II) which they shared with two environmental isolates. However, the RAPD analysis revealed that these environmental isolates had a RAPD pattern (RAPD cluster VI) distinct and different from either of the bird isolates (RAPD clusters II and IV). In all, four M. avium strains were verified as being inducers of avian tuberculosis in birds, and all were distinct from the three environmental strains identified. Thus, the results did not confirm the preliminary idea that a single strain had caused the epidemic. The polymorphism among M. avium strains highlighted the great biodiversity among an M. avium population even in a limited environmental setting during a short time span, and indicated the high susceptibility to avian tuberculosis of lesser white-fronted geese.

The complete genomic sequence of a Hungarian goose orthoreovirus strain (D20/99) is reported in this study. The genome of D20/99 is 22,969 bp in length (range, 3958 bp for L1 to 1124 bp for S4) and encodes 11 putative proteins. Pairwise sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses indicated that D20/99 shares genetic signatures with some contemporary Chinese duck and goose reovirus strains, except for the μA, μNS and σA protein coding genes, which represented independent genetic lineages. This study implies a greater genetic diversity among waterfowl-origin orthoreoviruses than hitherto recognized.

Samples collected from 791 wild animals (Canada geese, roe deer, hares, moose, wild boar and gulls) shot during hunting were examined for verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) O157, and thermophilic Campylobacter and Salmonella species. With the exception of one positive isolate from a wild boar, VTEC O157 was not isolated from any of the animals. Salmonella species were isolated only from the gulls, of which 4 per cent were estimated to be positive. Thermophilic Campylobacter species were commonly isolated from all the species except deer.

Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum are Apicomplexan intracellular protozoan parasites that affect numerous animal species, thus leading to severe diseases and economic losses, depending on the vertebrate species involved. The role of the avian species in maintaining and transmission of these coccidia has been studied for several years as they tend to serve as a potential source of infection for mammals and humans. The present study aimed to assess the serological exposure of Orinoco goose (Neochen jubata) to T. gondii and N. caninum. Between 2010 and 2013, 41 free-ranging Orinoco geese were captured in the Araguaia River, Brazil. The presence and titration of IgY antibodies to both coccidia were assayed via indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT). While IgY antibodies for N. caninum were present in 5 animals, with titers of 20, the antibodies for T. gondii were found in 35 animals, with titers ranging from 20 to 640. Considering that the Orinoco goose's meat is consumed by the local population in the studied area, it may represent an important source of T. gondii infection for humans. Due to its migratory behavior, this goose may play a pivotal role in the natural dispersion of both parasites. Furthermore, molecular studies are required for genotyping the isolates of T. gondii that occurs in this avian species.

ACSF2 (encoded by acyl-CoA synthetase family member 2) belongs to the acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) family, activating fatty acids by forming a thioester bond with CoA. In our previous study, a SNP residing in the intron of ACSF2 was identified to be linked to goose egg-laying performance. But the structure of goose ACSF2 as well as its role in reproduction remains unknown. In this study, we cloned and characterized ACSF2 in Yangzhou geese. A total of four alternative splice variants, designated as ACSF2-1, ACSF2-2, ACSF2-3 and ACSF2-4 respectively, were identified in the ovary. The coding regions of the four variants are 1770, 1692, 1599 and 1917 bp in length, respectively encoding 589, 563, 532 and 638 amino acids with conserved AMP-binding sites. All ACSF2 variants were widely expressed in 11 tested tissues in geese, except that the ACSF2-2 transcript was not detected in hypothalamus, pituitary gland and granulosa cells. Subcellular localization revealed that ACSF2 is a mitochondrial matrix protein. ACSF2 mRNA level was compared between high egg production (HEP; n = 8) and low egg production (LEP; n = 10) groups and showed a lower (P < 0.05) mRNA level in the HEP group. Further experiments indicated that overexpressing ACSF2 resulted in a significant increase of caspase-3 mRNA levels and that ACSF2 knockdown triggered a decrease in the caspase-3 mRNA level in granulosa cells. Similarly, the lower caspase-3 mRNA levels were identified in ovaries of the HEP group with lower ACSF2 mRNA levels. The research showed that the ACSF2 mRNA levels had a positive correlation with caspase-3 mRNA levels in vivo (R = 0.86, P < 0.01). Our results suggest that lower ACSF2 expression promotes the laying performance of goose possibly by inhibiting granulosa cell apoptosis and facilitating follicular development.

The goose liver is an ideal model for deciphering lipogenesis molecular mechanisms. This study was designed to investigate the effect of different lipid sources on hepatic lipogenesis in overfed geese. Sixty Landes geese were fed ad libitum with no fat (control) or overfed diets containing 2% goose fat (GF) or rapeseed oil (RO) for 20 days. We measured fatty acid composition of the liver at day 20 of overfeeding. We performed a transcriptomic comparison of fatty liver between GF and RO-fed geese to gain insights into the molecular and cellular events mediating lipogenesis activity. The results showed that there was no substantial effect on fatty liver performance between GF- and RO-fed geese. Significant differences in fatty acid composition were detected between GF- and RO-fed geese. Total ω-6 PUFAs increased and saturated fatty acid decreased (P < 0.05) with RO supplementation when compared with GF, but ω-3 PUFAs did not differ between the two diets. Concentrations of C16:1, C18:1, C18:2, C20:2, and C22:1 were higher (P < 0.05) in the fatty liver of RO-fed geese compared to those in the GF group. Analysis of transcriptome sequencing showed that there were 124 up-regulated and 129 down-regulated differentially expressed genes in the fatty liver of RO and GF-fed geese. Many of these genes code for proteins involved in the lipid metabolic process, including bile secretion, adipocytokine signalling pathway, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, linoleic acid metabolism, fatty acid elongation and fatty acid biosynthesis, and fat digestion and absorption. Moreover, genes involved in lipid-related pathways such as peroxisome, steroid biosynthesis, steroid hormone biosynthesis, retinol metabolism, and apoptosis were altered, suggesting that the fatty liver of goose fed different oils undertakes both an oxidation function and hormone-related metabolic function. In conclusions, these data suggest that RO supplementation reduces liver lipid oxidation and improves lipogenesis. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in fatty liver formation and provide valuable resources for analysing mechanisms underlying the effects of oils from different sources on the goose fatty liver.

Geese, ducks, mallards, and swans are birds of the order Anseriformes, which are found in the wild, in zoos and parks, and raised for meat consumption. Toxoplasma gondii, Sarcocystis sp., and Neospora caninum are protozoans of several species of animals. Wild and domestic birds can serve as intermediate hosts, disseminators and potential sources of infection of these protozoa to humans through contaminated meat. The aims of this study were: (i) to perform a serological survey of T. gondii, Sarcocystis sp. and N. caninum in geese (Anser sp.) from public parks and from captivity and (ii) to compare seroprevalence between these two locations. Antibodies were detected by Immunofluorescence antibody test using the serum of 149 geese. Antibodies to Sarcocystis sp., T. gondii, and N. caninum were detected in 28.18%, 18% and 0.67% of geese, respectively; 57% of geese from urban parks and 26.53% of geese from captivity were seropositive for at least one protozoa. The results indicate environmental contamination, particularly for the occurrence of antibodies against T. gondii - a zoonosis that causes toxoplasmosis and is transmitted through oocyte ingestion. This is the first serological survey of T. gondii, Sarcocystis sp. and N. caninum in geese from urban parks in Curitiba, Brazil.

Introduction of the West Nile virus (WNV) to Hawai'i will undoubtedly devastate many populations of critically endangered avian species indigenous to Hawai'i. The protective efficacy of a protein-based WNV subunit vaccine formulated with adjuvant was evaluated in domestic geese as a surrogate species for the endangered Nēnē, the state bird of Hawai'i. Prevention of viremia following viral infection of vaccinated birds was used as the clinical endpoint of protection. ELISA and plaque reduction neutralization tests demonstrate that significant levels of vaccine antigen-specific antibody were produced in groups of birds vaccinated with 5 or 10 microg of the WN-80E antigen formulated with ISA720 adjuvant. Moreover, after challenge with WNV, no viremia was detected in vaccinated birds, whereas viremia was detected up to 4 days after and virus was detected by oral swab for 6 days after infection among control groups. Safe and effective vaccination of managed or captive endangered bird populations will protect species with critically low numbers that could not survive the added mortality of introduced disease.

The subtype H9N2 avian influenza virus greatly threatens the Chinese poultry industry, even with annual vaccination. Waterfowl can be asymptomatically infected with the H9N2 virus. In this study, three H9N2 virus strains, designated A/Goose/Jiangsu/YZ527/2011 (H9N2, Gs/JS/YZ527/11), A/Goose/Jiangsu/SQ119/2012 (H9N2, Gs/JS/SQ119/12), and A/Goose/Jiangsu/JD564/2012 (H9N2, Gs/JS/JD564/12), were isolated from domestic geese. Molecular characterization of the three isolates showed that the Gs/JS/YZ527/11 virus is a double-reassortant virus, combining genes of A/Quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 (H9N2, G1/97)-like and A/Chicken/Shanghai/F/98 (H9N2, F/98)-like; the Gs/JS/SQ119/12 virus is a triple-reassortant virus combining genes of G1/97-like, F/98-like, and A/Duck/Shantou/163/2004 (H9N2, ST/163/04)-like. The sequences of Gs/JS/JD564/12 share high homology with those of the F/98 virus, except for the neuraminidase gene, whereas the internal genes of Gs/JS/YZ527/11 and Gs/JS/SQ119/12 are closely related to those of the H7N9 viruses. An infectivity analysis of the three isolates showed that Gs/JS/SQ119/12 and Gs/JS/YZ527/11 replicated well, with seroconversion, in geese and chickens, the Gs/JS/JD564/12 did not infect well in geese or chickens, and the F/98 virus only infected chickens, with seroconversion. Emergence of these new reassortant H9N2 avian influenza viruses indicates that these viruses can infect both chicken and goose and can produce different types of lesions in each species.

We report the complete nucleotide (nt) sequences of eleven goose circovirus (GoCV) isolated in Taiwan. Nine out of the eleven isolates had a genome size of 1821 nt, whereas the remaining two isolates have a size of 1820 nt. Sequence comparisons of the eleven Taiwanese GoCV isolates and a German isolate revealed that these viruses could be divided into three distinct genetic groups. Group I contains the German isolate, group II contains three Taiwanese isolates, and group III contains eight Taiwanese isolates. Nucleotide differences between viruses of different genetic groups ranged from 7.0-7.7%, whereas the differences within the same group were only 0.2-1.0%. The most diversified sequences were found at a region between nt 27-72 of the viral genome, which corresponded to the right one-third of the 5' intergenic region. Open reading frame analysis shows that the genome of all Taiwanese GoCV isolates could encode four proteins: V1 (Rep, 293 amino acids), V2 (37 amino acids), C1 (capsid, 250 amino acids), and C2 (99 amino acids). The sizes of V1, C1 and C2 proteins of all Taiwanese isolates and the German GoCV isolates were identical. However, the size of V2 protein (37 amino acids), although identical in all Taiwanese isolates, was much smaller than that of the German isolate (120 amino acids). Moreover, the initiation codon of the V2 ORF of three Taiwanese isolates was ATA rather than ATG. Our result indicates that GoCV of multiple genetic groups might have been circulating in Europe and Asia, and these viruses differ in their nucleotide sequences, sizes of the genome, and sizes of the V2 ORFs.

A 38-year-old man with no history of pulmonary disease developed intermittent hives and bronchospasms shortly after returning from a hunting trip. Approximately one year later, examination of an excised subcutaneous nodule demonstrated infection with a mesocercaria (larval trematode). The morphology of the parasite was consistent with infection with a parasite of the Alaria spp. or Strigea spp. Eating undercooked wild goose meat during the hunting trip was the most likely source of infection. This appears to be the first report of human infection with mesocercariae acquired through the ingestion of wild goose meat.

1. The intravenous injection of large volumes of 0.5 M-NaCl that are usually used to induce nasal gland secretion in marine birds has been shown in geese to increase greatly plasma volume, cardiac output, heart rate and stroke volume at the time secretion commences after 2-8 min.2. There were no consistent changes in mean arterial blood pressure or in the distribution of the cardiac output to major organs except to the salt-glands whose share increased approximately fourteenfold. Salt-gland blood flow remained high for 10-20 min after cardiac output and heart rate had returned to nearly normal levels.3. The increases in plasma volume and venous return are unlikely to be the stimuli for salt-gland secretion because secretion was also initiated by giving artificial sea water into the proventriculus and this produced no changes in these variables at the time secretion commenced, 5-14 min later.4. At the start of secretion in orally loaded birds, the only detectable changes in the plasma were small increases in osmolality (from 1.3 to 4.6%), Na (from 0.3 to 6%) and Cl (from 1.3 to 7.1%) concentrations.

Because of the high incidence of aspergillosis, fungal disease is an important condition in the waterfowl. Although this is generally a disease of individual birds, epizootics have been reported when overwhelming spore loads are present. By contrast, the occurrence of fungal disease is quite sporadic in the pigeon. In both groups of birds, however, the zoonotic potential of fungal diseases such as cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, and blastomycosis is clinically significant. The abundant creatinine levels in droppings serve as a nitrogen source for these organisms. This allows their numbers to increase dramatically, which in turn increases the risk of disease transmission. Because pigeons often live in close proximity to people, their role in disease transmission is considered particularly important.

The strep avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (SABC) immunohistochemical methods were applied to investigate the localization and semi-quantitative distribution of IFN-γ, IL-1α, NGF-β and TNF-α-immunoreactive cells in the cerebellar cortex of Western Anhui white goose at embryonic day 13, 19, 24, 28 (E13, E19, E24, E28) and postnatal day 7, 15 (P7, P15). The possible roles of IFN-γ,IL-1α,NGF-β and TNF-α in the development of cerebellar cortex were discussed. The results indicated that in the external granular layer, there were IFN-γ and TNF-α positive cells at E13, E19, E24, E28, P7, IL-1α positive cells at E13, E19, E24, E28 and NGF-β positive cells at E13, E19 , E24. The expression levels of these four cytokines all reached peaks at E19 of the six tested periods in this study. In the Purkinje cell layer, there were IFN-γ, IL-1α and TNF-α positive cells at E13, E19, E24, E28, P7, P15 and NGF-β positive cells at E13, E19, E24, E28, P7. In the internal granular layer, there were IFN-γ positive cells at E13, E19, E24, E28, P7, P15, IL-1α and TNF-α positive cells at E13, E19, E24, E28, P7 and NGF-β positive cells at E13, E19, E24, E28. These results showed that E19 might be the "critical stage"in the cerebellar cortex development of Western Anhui white goose. IFN-γ, IL-1α and TNF-α might be synthesized by cerebellar cortex itself, and NGF-β could be transported from regions which project to Purkinje cells. IFN-γ may interfer the transfer of granular cells, and NGF-β may have neurotrophic functions that are beneficial to the growth and development of Purkinje cells.

Chlamydia psittaci, the agent of psittacosis in humans, infects a wide range of bird species. To assess the risk of psittacosis posed by domestic geese in China, the seroprevalence of C. psittaci infection in domestic geese in Hainan province, tropical China was examined using indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA). The overall seroprevalence was estimated at 25.6% (461/1800; 95% CI: 23.6-27.6). The C. psittaci seroprevalence ranged from 19% (95% CI: 14.6-23.4) to 34% (95% CI: 28.6-39.4) among different regions in Hainan province, and the differences were statistically significant (P<0.01). The risk factors significantly associated with C. psittaci seroprevalence were the presence of hygiene conditions, age, gender, and environment of geese in the farms. The results of the present investigation indicated the high seroprevalence of C. psittaci infection in geese in Hainan province, tropical China. Close contact with these geese is associated with a risk of zoonotic transmission of C. psittaci. Public education should be implemented to reduce the risk of avian to human transmission of such a pathogenic agent. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report documenting the occurrence of C. psittaci seroprevalence in geese in China.

The cDNAs encoding two distinct type I interferon receptors were firstly cloned from the spleen of white goose (the Chinese goose, Anser cygnoides). The cDNA of goose IFNAR1 consisted of 1616 bp and encoded 406 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 46.4 kDa, while the cDNA of goose IFNAR2 consisted of 1525 bp and encoded 294 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 32.6 kDa. The IFNAR1 shared 85.4% identity in deduced amino acid sequence with duck IFNAR1, while IFNAR2 amino acid sequence showed 86% identity with that of duck IFNAR2. The age-related analysis of gene expression revealed that goose IFNα and IFNARs were all highly transcribed in pancreas, which may due to a reasonable amount of dendritic cells aggregated in pancreas. And goose IFNα and its cognate receptors had different structural features and tissue expression patterns during the period from embryonic goose to adult goose, suggesting that IFNα and IFNARs may maintain a developmental dynamic immune competence in unstimulated states. The data provided in this study may contribute to future understanding of the interaction between interferon and interferon receptors in immune mechanism. And it also helps us to understand the age-related susceptibility to pathogens in birds better.

Riemerella anatipestifer (RA) is a widely distributed bacterial pathogen of birds responsible for remarkable losses to poultry production, especially among waterfowl. We characterized the genomic diversity of 166 field isolates of RA, collected from geese and ducks, using enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The field strains and five reference strains showed 17 distinct patterns consisting of five to 12 bands ranging from approximately 150-1800bp. The majority of the strains belonged to two closely related ERIC-PCR types (A and B), while the other types contained only a few isolates each. There was no association between ERIC-PCR type and host species, place, or year of isolation; however the ERIC-PCR pattern was correlated with serotype for most isolates. The majority of serotype 1 strains (101/107) belonged to ERIC-PCR type A while the remaining six strains represented five different ERIC-PCR types (D, G, L, M, and O). Serotypes 1,7 and 7 corresponded to ERIC-PCR types B and C, respectively. Serotypes 2, 4, and 10 could be subdivided by ERIC-PCR revealing two to four patterns within each serotype. These results indicate that ERIC-PCR may be a suitable technique for the molecular identification of RA serotypes, and the detection of subtypes within certain serotypes may aid further epidemiological investigations. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS ERIC-PCR analysis of field R. anatipestifer strains revealed 17 distinct patterns Most strains belonged to two closely related ERIC-PCR types Serotype 1 was the most prevalent serotype representing 64.5% of the strains ERIC-PCR may be suitable for molecular identification of R. anatipestifer serotypes.

Two molecular forms of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), i.e., PACAP27 and PACAP38 (0.0001-1 microM), as well as vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP; 0.1-3 microM), have been studied for their effects on cyclic AMP formation in the hypothalamus and cerebral cortex of duck and goose. All three peptides concentration-dependently stimulated cyclic AMP production in the tested brain regions of 2-3-weeks-old (young) ducks, with VIP showing at least one order of magnitude weaker activity than PACAP. This characteristics suggests the existence in the duck's brain of adenylyl cyclase-linked PAC1 receptors. Both forms of PACAP also stimulated the nucleotide formation in the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus of 5-6-months-old (adult) ducks or geese grown under natural environment. The peptides-evoked effects in adult and young ducks were comparable, and clearly greater than those found in adult geese. The present data extend our recent observations made on chicks, and suggest PACAP to be a potent stimulator of the cyclic AMP generation in the avian central nervous system.

Chronic lesions of the beak, footweb, and eye of geese photosensitized by the comsumption of Ammi majus (L.) are described, 7 weeks after the acute symptoms commenced. Sixty-four (48%) of the 133 birds in the flock showed various degrees of abnormality. All affected birds had stunting of the upper beak and cicatrization and thickening of the footweb. Eighty-nine percent of the affected birds showed ocular involvement, comprising chemosis, blepharoconjunctivitis, keratitis, symblepharon, ankyloblepharon, cicatricial ectropium, and mydriasis.

Of the 18 043 bird species, the eggs of only hen and quail are generally available to consumers. Thus people are deprived of the opportunity to benefit from the huge diversity of eggs offered by nature. Poultry eggs can vary in their color of albumen and yolk, smell, taste and texture. In this study, sighted and blind people were employed for sensory evaluation with the aim of determining the preferences of consumers toward hard-boiled and scrambled eggs of different species of birds, and whether the appearance of these eggs has an effect on the perception of other sensory impressions.

Results concerning the contents of retinol in the liver, residual yoke of 25-day embryos and yoke of eggs depending on the level of vitamins A, D3 and E in the diet of geese by grey Obroshin breeds in reproductive period are presented in the paper. It is established, that vitamin D3 reduces the level of retinol deposition in the tissues of embryos and yoke of eggs of geese, and addition of vitamins A and E to a diet of geese raises the level of retinol both in the liver and residual yoke of embryos, and in yokes of geese eggs. Besides the data about changes of fatty-acid spectrum of common lipids and contents of lipid peroxidations products in tissues of the liver and pectoral muscles of 25-day embryos are presented in the paper depending on the level of vitamins A, D3 and E in geese diet during their reproductive period. Introduction of vitamin A--in quantity of 10000 IU, vitamin D3--in quantity of 3000 IU, in the composition of mixed fodder of geese during the reproductive period and vitamin E in quantity 35 IU on 1 kg to mixed fodder optimizes fatty-acid structure of the common lipids and the level of peroxidations lipids products in the liver and pectoral muscles of embryos.

We have solved the X-ray structure of barley chitinase and bacterial chitosanase. Structural constraints predicted these would work by an inverting mechanism, which has been confirmed biochemically. The two enzymes were compared with lysozymes from goose (GEWL), phage (T4L), and hen (HEWL). Although the proteins share no significant amino acid similarities, they are shown to have a structurally invariant core containing two helices and a three-stranded beta sheet that from the substrate binding and catalytic cleft. These enzymes represent a superfamily of hydrolases arising from the divergent evolution of an ancient protein. The glycohydrolase superfamily can be structurally divided into a bacterial family (chitosanase and T4L), and a eucaryotic family represented by chitinase, GEWL, and HEWL. Both families contain the ancestral core but differ at the amino and carboxy termini. The eucaryotes have a small N terminal domain, while the procaryotes have none. The C terminal domain of the eucaryotic family contains a single alpha-helix, while the prokaryotic domain has three antiparallel helices.

Individual blood samples were collected from wing veins of eight adult pigeons, two adult chickens and four adult geese and were analyzed for oxygen dissociation curves by hemo-scan, an instrument measuring PO2 and O2 saturation simultaneously. The findings agree with the common belief that avian blood in general has a low affinity for oxygen. Blood pH, PCO2, concentration of 2,3-DPG, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, red blood cell, hemoglobin and hematocrit were also determined, the related parameters have been calculated. Normal values of those variables were reported and the possible effects of some of those parameters on oxygen affinity are postulated.

Continuous surveillance of the influenza viruses isolated from domestic poultry from southern China and Hong Kong over more than 4 years resulted in the isolation of influenza viruses possessing 46 different combinations of haemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) subtypes. Of these, 43 were obtained from ducks from China. In all cases, infection appeared to be asymptomatic. The antigenic combination found most commonly in the viruses isolated was H4N6, which accounted for approximately one-quarter of the duck isolates, its occurrence being more frequent than expected from a statistical analysis of the observed frequencies of the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes among all the isolates. Some combinations of H and N occurred less frequently than expected or not at all. Influenza viruses tended to be isolated more frequently from ducks during the summer months in comparison with paramyxoviruses, which were more commonly encountered in the winter. Possible reasons for the great antigenic diversity of influenza A viruses in the poultry, especially the ducks, in the region are discussed together with the potential significance of these viruses to the emergence of human influenza pandemics.

Peptide fragments possessing antimicrobial activity were obtained by protease digestion of goose egg white lysozyme. Digested peptide purified from RP-HPLC which showed no lysozyme activity exhibited bactericidal activity toward Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. LC/MS-MS and automated Edman degradation revealed the amino acid sequence to be Thr-Ala-Lys-Pro-Glu-Gly-Leu-Ser-Tyr. This sequence corresponds to amino acid positions 20-28, located at the N-terminal outer part of goose lysozyme. The peptide acted on bacterial membrane as shown by scanning electron microscopy. The mechanism of action could be explained from a helical structure that may be formed by the centered Pro residue and the terminal Lys residue after the peptide attaches to a cell membrane. This is the first study to report that a peptide derived from the protease digests of G-type lysozyme possesses antimicrobial activity with broad spectrum activity. Our result is comparative to the previous reports of Chicken lysozyme and T4 phage lysozyme, which showed antimicrobial activity after digestion with protease. These results might contribute to the usage of antimicrobial peptides engineered by genetic or chemical synthesis.

During February to July 1984, 23 outbreaks of Newcastle disease were confirmed in chickens in Great Britain. Use of available mouse monoclonal antibodies enabled unequivocal identification of the virus responsible for 22 of the outbreaks as similar to the avian paramyxovirus type 1 (A/PMV-1) virus causing neurotropic disease in pigeons during 1983 and 1984. Epidemiological investigations presented evidence that 19 of these outbreaks occurred either directly or indirectly as a result of spread from diseased pigeons infesting food stores at Liverpool docks. Virus was isolated from carcases of pigeons found among the food and samples of the food itself. The remaining outbreak was shown to involve a virus unrelated to the virus infecting pigeons.

In the spring of 1975, many species of waterfowl and common crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) were found dead in Phelps County, Nebraska. About 25,000 water fowl and at least 3,000 crows died in the epornitic. Few waterfowl were seen dying, but the crows experienced a chronic illness during which they became debilitated and were lethargic and dyspneic. Gross and microscopic lesions in the waterfowl were typical for acute avian cholera. The crows had dark, firm areas within the lungs, loosely adhered yellow fibrous material in the pericardial sac and air sacs and, occasionally, liver abscesses. Microscopically, focal purulent pneumonia was present and a fibrinopurulent exudate overlaid a granulomatous reaction on the heart and lung surfaces. Isolation of Pasteurella multocida serotype 1 confirmed the diagnosis of acute and chronic avian cholera in the waterfowl and crows, respectively.

Bar-headed geese fly at altitudes of up to 9,000 m on their biannual migration over the Himalayas. To determine whether the flight muscle of this species has evolved to facilitate exercise at high altitude, we compared the respiratory properties of permeabilized muscle fibers from bar-headed geese and several low-altitude waterfowl species. Respiratory capacities were assessed for maximal ADP stimulation (with single or multiple inputs to the electron transport system) and cytochrome oxidase excess capacity (with an exogenous electron donor) and were generally 20-40% higher in bar-headed geese when creatine was present. When respiration rates were extrapolated to the entire pectoral muscle mass, bar-headed geese had a higher mass-specific aerobic capacity. This may represent a surplus capacity that counteracts the depressive effects of hypoxia on mitochondrial respiration. However, there were no differences in activity for mitochondrial or glycolytic enzymes measured in homogenized muscle. The [ADP] leading to half-maximal stimulation (K(m)) was approximately twofold higher in bar-headed geese (10 vs. 4-6 microM), and, while creatine reduced K(m) by 30% in this species, it had no effect on K(m) in low-altitude birds. Mitochondrial creatine kinase may therefore contribute to the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation in flight muscle of bar-headed geese, which could promote efficient coupling of ATP supply and demand. However, this was not based on differences in creatine kinase activity in isolated mitochondria or homogenized muscle. The unique differences in bar-headed geese existed without prior exercise or hypoxia exposure and were not a result of phylogenetic history, and may, therefore, be important evolutionary specializations for high-altitude flight.

Elevation of egg performance is vital to goose farming. Many poultry scientists are seeking for efficient molecular genetic markers associated with egg yield. In this study, mRNA differential display was adopted to investigate gene expression profiling in the follicular development of goose. For the first time, a novel SMAD family protein SMAD9 (EST CJ111007) was found to be involved in follicular initiation and used to be a candidate gene. Functional regions analysis of Smad9 indicated that SMAD9 protein is highly conserved in MH1 and MH2 domains, and the connection area is highly variable region. 6 pairs of primers (p1-p6) were designed to detect the SNPs of Smad9 by PCR-SSCP method. The results revealed that polymorphisms were discovered in the PCR products amplified with P1 primers in exon1 and P3 primers in intron2. In Smad9 exon1, 5 genotypes were found: FK, FF, JJ, JK and KK, including 2 SNPs: 243 bp G → A, 309 bp T → G, the mutations did not result in amino acid mutations; In intron2, 3 genotypes were found: AA, BB and AB, only 1 SNP (C → T). The annual egg yield of FK genotype geese or allele gene A in intron2 are significantly more than those of other genotypes on the average (p < 0.05). Taken together, it is suggested that Smad9 is a promising candidate gene affecting egg performance in goose.

Approximately 300 geese, primarily lesser Canada geese (Branta canadensis parvipes) were found unable to fly or dead on a small hypersaline lake (conductivity 77,000-90,000 mumhos/cm) in western Saskatchewan in September 1985. The birds were heavily encrusted with sodium sulfate crystals. Dead birds that were necropsied had aspirated lake water and had evidence of acute muscle degeneration. The live geese (155) were captured and moved to nearby freshwater wetlands where most apparently survived. Some birds died of severe myopathy after translocation. Five northern shovelers (Anas clypeata) were found encrusted with salt and unable to fly on the lake approximately 10 days later. Salt encrustation apparently occurred when rapid cooling of the lake resulted in supersaturation and crystallization of the dissolved salt. A local resident recalled similar events occurring on the lake in autumn on at least two other occasions during the past 50 yr.

IFN-kappa (IFN-κ) is a type I IFN expressed by keratinocytes, monocytes and dendritic cells with important roles during the innate immune response period. This research was conducted to elaborate the evolution and characteristics of IFN-κ in poultry. Chicken IFN-κ is located on the sex-determining Z chromosome, which is greatly different from mammals. Poultry IFN-κ cluster together in a species-specific manner through positive selection pressure and share only 19-33% homology with mammalian IFN-κ and poultry other type I IFN. Both chicken and duck IFN-κ was constitutively expressed in spleen, skin, lung, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), as well as being significantly induced after treatment with virus in PBMC. Biologically, poultry IFN-κ has antiviral activity against VSV in chicken embryonic fibroblasts and duck embryonic fibroblasts (CEF and DEF) cells, and induces the expression of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs). After treatment with JAK1 inhibitor, the ISGs expression can be down-regulated. Overall, our research on poultry IFN-κ not only enriches the knowledge about IFN-κ but also facilitates further research on the role of type I IFNs in antiviral defense responses in poultry.

T-2 trichothecene fusariotoxin was administered to 110 laying geese and 33 ganders in the active egg production period through a tube at 2-day intervals on a total of 10 occasions. After the treatment, the geese were subjected to detailed pathomorphological examination. In the ovaries of layers, a cessation of follicle maturation and follicle degeneration dependent on the toxin dose were observed, accompanied by ovulation and consequent peritonitis in the birds that died and in some of those killed by bleeding. Additional findings included involution of the oviduct, lymphocyte depletion, necrosis and amyloidosis in the spleen, catarrhal enteritis, signs of colloid stasis in the thyroid and large numbers of secretory granules in the cytoplasm of the adrenaline-producing cells of the adrenal gland. In the ganders, toxin administration did not reduce the intensity of spermatogenesis but in the spleen, intestine and endocrine glands it caused changes similar to those seen in the layers.

Twenty-seven wild geese (Anser albifrons) suffering from lead poisoning caused by ingestion of lead shot were treated with disodium calcium ethylenediaminetetraacetate. The concentration of lead in blood ranged from 0.4 to 23.0 micrograms/ml, with a mean concentration of 5.6 micrograms/ml. In 22 of the birds, 1 to 48 lead pellets (mean, 10.5 pellets/bird) were seen on radiographs of their gizzards. Eleven of 27 birds recovered 3 to 8 weeks after the initiation of treatment. In the birds that recovered, the lead pellets were rapidly eroded as the birds recovered their appetites in response to treatment, and disappeared radiographically between treatment days 17 and 52. The birds that did not survive died within 4 weeks, despite decreased concentrations of lead in blood. Of these 16 birds, 15 had radiographic evidence of impaction of the proventriculus at the first examination and no evidence of resolution of the impaction at the time of death. In contrast, only 2 of the 11 geese that recovered had impaction of the proventriculus at the time of admission. Thus, the condition of the proventriculus seems to be the first consideration to evaluate in the prognosis of lead poisoning in geese.

We conducted a 3-yr study (2001-03) on greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons frontalis) breeding in Alaska, USA, to determine the exposure of this population to Pasteurella multocida and the potential role of these birds as disease carriers. We tested sera from nearly 600 adult geese for antibodies to P. multocida serotype 1. We found a low prevalence (<5%) of positive antibodies in adult geese, and based on the short duration of detectable antibodies, these findings indicate recent infection with P. multocida. Prevalence was similar to serologic results from both breeding and wintering lesser snow geese. We also collected oral (n=1,035), nasal (n=102), and cloacal (n=90) swab samples to determine the presence of avian cholera carriers in this population. We were unable to isolate P. multocida serotype 1 from any of the birds sampled. Based on comparison with other waterfowl species, we concluded that these geese may be exposed to avian cholera during the winter or spring migration but are unlikely to play a significant role as carriers of the bacterium causing avian cholera.

This study presents concentrations of Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, Pb and Cd in livers, kidneys, muscles and bones of white-fronted geese Anser albifrons (geese) and spot-billed ducks Anas poecilorhyncha (ducks). Iron in livers, kidneys and muscles, Zn in muscles, Mn and Cd in every tissue, Cu in livers, muscles and bones and Pb in bones differed between species, and there were significant differences among tissues in both species. Essential elements such as Fe, Zn, Mn and Cu concentrations were within the background levels. Lead concentrations in livers of 7 of 14 geese and 7 of 19 ducks and in bones of 4 of 19 ducks exceeded background concentrations for waterfowl (5 μg/g dw for the liver, 10 μg/g dw for the bone). Almost all samples of both species had the background Cd concentrations in the liver (33 of 33 geese and ducks) and kidney (14 geese and 18 ducks). Tissue concentrations of Cd were greater in geese than ducks. In contrast, tissue concentrations of Pb in bones were greater in ducks than in geese. These different trends for Cd and Pb reflect a short and/or long term difference in exposure and degree of accumulation of these metals.

The newly emerged disease, duck beak atrophy and dwarfism syndrome (BADS), is caused by novel goose parovirus (N-GPV). Although N-GPV infection has severe consequences, few methods for detecting this virus have been developed. Therefore, the availability of rapid and reliable molecular diagnostic methods would aid future studies of this novel virus. Clinical specimens from 138 suspected cases of N-GPV infection and 120 cloacal swabs from breeding ducks were used in this study. The targeted sequence of N-GPV cloned into the pMD18-T vector was used to generate the N-GPV DNA standard curve. The specificity of the assay was validated using duck plague virus, GPV, duck hepatitis virus, avian influenza virus, duck reovirus, tembusu virus, and fowl adenovirus. The lowest limit of detection was 8.8×101copies/μL with a good linear standard curve (Y=-3.3682X+37.220, R2=0.9953) over a wide range of input DNA, of which the concentration was between 8.8×101 to 8.8×108copies/μL. The results show that the real-time PCR assay is a highly sensitive, specific, reproducible, and versatile method for quantitatively detecting N-GPV DNA, and thus can be used to detect this virus, thereby facilitating epidemiological investigations of animals with BADS.

To better understand the molecular mechanism(s) underlying egg-laying in Sichuan white geese, the profiles of genes in the pituitary gland were investigated during the prelaying and laying periods. Total RNA was extracted from the pituitary glands of geese during prelaying or laying periods and cDNA was generated. After sequencing and annotation, 54 upregulated and 84 downregulated genes were obtained from gene libraries. These genes were related primarily to biosynthetic processes, cellular nitrogen metabolic processes, transport, cell differentiation, cellular protein modification processes, signal transduction, and small molecule metabolic processes. Eleven genes were selected for further analyses using quantitative real-time PCR, and the results were generally consistent with the profiling results. Among these genes, levels of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone, vasoactive intestinal peptide and its receptor, follistatin, estrogen receptor beta, and the progesterone receptor were differentially overexpressed during the prelaying period compared with the laying period. These results provide a solid foundation for elucidating the molecular mechanism of egg-laying performance in Sichuan white geese.

A total of 54 domestic white meat-type geese were included in vaccination/challenge trials to evaluate susceptibility to disease and humoral immune responses using the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and virus neutralization (VN) tests against Newcastle disease (ND). Two groups of twenty geese, five weeks of age, were conjunctivally vaccinated with either 100 x 10(6) or 2.5 x 10(6) EID50 (egg infectious dose 50 per cent) per bird of live La Sota virus, respectively, and 14 geese remained unvaccinated. At 15 weeks of age all vaccinated geese and seven unvaccinated geese were subcutaneously injected with 0.5 ml of inactivated oil emulsion ND vaccine, whereas seven geese remained as negative controls. At an age of 20 weeks, all 54 geese were challenged with 10(8.0) EID50 per bird of the viscerotropic velogenic NDV strain Herts 33/56. Live virus application as well as the oil emulsion vaccine did not induce discernible clinical signs and have no detrimental effect on body weight gains. At days 1, 3, 5, 8, 13, 16, 20, 23 and 27 after the application of lentogenic vaccine pharyngeal and cloacal swabs were taken, after challenge samples were taken at days 2, 5 and 8. Lentogenic as well as velogenic virus were never reisolated. Low and shortlived antibody responses post vaccination were equally well measured in HI and VN tests. Only two out of seven unvaccinated but challenged geese developed signs of ND whereas all vaccinated/challenged geese remained normal but developed high to moderate levels of HI and VN antibodies. Since domestic geese do not readily excrete NDV's in detectable amounts and since they do not contain detectable amounts of the challenge virus fourteen days post challenge in their tissues the assumption is promoted that geese do not play a major role in the epidemiology of Newcastle disease.

Blood films and serum samples from free-ranging waterfowl wintering in and migrating through Oklahoma were examined for hematozoa and tested for antibody responses to Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and type-A influenza. One-hundred-eleven of 728 birds (15.24%) were positive for 1 or more hematozoa. Serologic testing revealed 11 of 280 (3.93%) positive for antibody to NDV and 5 of 171 (2.95%) positive for antibody to type-A influenza.

During December 1983 and early January 1984, about 200 Canada geese (Branta canadensis) died of lead poisoning at Parker River National Wildlife Refuge on Plum Island, Massachusetts. In an effort to determine the source of lead, 100 bottom samples were taken from a refuge impoundment where much of the mortality/morbidity occurred. An average of 157,150 pellets/ha was found with a range of 64,582 to 322,910 pellets/ha. Water levels in this impoundment were low when Canada geese arrived, making shot more readily available to the geese and contributing to the outbreak. To minimize the risk of Canada geese being exposed to lead shot poisoning at this location in the future, we recommend several corrective manipulations of habitat.

From the reassortment experiments between A/Aichi/4/92 and A/WSN/33 (WSN) (H1N1) viruses, two different phenotype viruses which contained the haemagglutinin (HA) gene from A/Aichi/4/92 virus and the neuraminidase (NA) gene from WSN virus were obtained. PW13 and PW15 viruses agglutinated chicken red blood cells (CRBC), while PW10 and PW70 viruses did not. However, the expressed HA proteins of these viruses did not adsorb CRBC. The difference in gene constellation between PW13, PW15 and PW10, PW70 viruses was the membrane protein (M) gene. The former two had the M gene from A/Aichi/4/92 virus and the latter two had that from WSN virus. In PW15-infected cells, haemadsorption of CRBC was observed 30 min later than that of goose red blood cells and the M1 protein migrated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm 30 min earlier than adsorption of CRBC was observed. On the other hand, in PW10-infected cells, haemadsorption of CRBC was not observed through the virus replication and the M1 protein stayed in the nucleus after HA and NA activities reached maximum levels. Co-expression of the M and the HA proteins of A/Aichi/4/92 virus did not help the HA protein gain the ability to adsorb CRBC. However, neuraminidase treatment of COS cells expressing the HA protein of A/Aichi/4/92 virus or MDCK cells infected by PW10 virus restored the ability to adsorb CRBC. We discussed the possibility that the M1 protein helped the NA protein in its role to modify the HA protein on the cell surface.

The mechanism of phenylalanine regulation of rat liver phenylalanine hydroxylase was studied. We show that phenylalanine "activates" phenylalanine hydroxylase, converting it from an inactive to active form, by binding at a true allosteric regulatory site. One phenylalanine molecule binds per enzyme subunit; it remains at this site during catalytic turnover and, while there, cannot be hydroxylated. Loss of phenylalanine from the site causes a loss of enzymatic activity. The rate of loss of activation is dramatically slowed by phenylalanine, which kinetically "traps" activated enzyme during relaxation from the activated to unactivated state. An empirical equation is presented which allows calculation of relaxation rates over a wide range of temperatures and phenylalanine concentrations. Kinetic trapping by phenylalanine is a novel effect. It was analyzed in detail, and its magnitude implied that phenylalanine activation involves cooperativity among all four subunits of the enzyme tetramer. A regulatory model is presented, accounting for the properties of the phenylalanine activation reaction in the forward and reverse directions and at equilibrium. Fluorescence quenching studies confirmed that activation increases the solvent accessibility of the enzyme's tryptophan residues. Physical and kinetic properties of purified phenylalanine hydroxylase from rat, rabbit, baboon, and goose liver were compared. All enzymes were remarkably alike in catalytic and regulatory properties, suggesting that control of this enzyme is similar in mammals and birds.

Analysis of the sequences of all eight RNA segments of the influenza A/G oose/Guangdong/1/96 (H5N1) virus, isolated from a sick goose during an outbreak in Guangdong province, China, in 1996, revealed that the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of the virus was genetically similar to those of the H5N1 viruses isolated in Hong Kong in 1997. However, the remaining genes showed greater similarity to other avian influenza viruses. Notably, the neuraminidase gene did no have the 19-amino-acid deletion in the stalk region seen in the H5N1 Hong Kong viruses and the NS gene belonged to allele B, while that of the H5N1 Hong Kong viruses belonged to allele A. These data suggest that the H5N1 viruses isolated from the Hong Kong outbreaks derived their HA genes from a virus similar to the A/Goose/Guangdong/1/96 virus or shared a progenitor with this goose pathogen.

Color vision is not uniform across the retina because of differences in photoreceptor density and distribution. Retinal areas with a high density of cone photoreceptors may overlap with those with a high density of ganglion cells, increasing hue discrimination. However, there are some exceptions to this cell distribution pattern, particularly in species with horizontal visual streaks (bands of high ganglion cell density across the retina) that live in open habitats. We studied the spectral sensitivity and distribution of cone photoreceptors involved in chromatic and achromatic vision in the Canada goose (Branta canadiensis), which possesses an oblique rather than horizontal visual streak at the ganglion cell layer. Using microspectrophotometry, we found that the Canada goose has a violet-sensitive visual system with four visual pigments with absorbance peaks at 409, 458, 509 and 580 nm. The density of most cones involved in chromatic and achromatic vision peaked along a band across the retina that matched the oblique orientation of the visual streak. With the information on visual sensitivity, we calculated chromatic and achromatic contrasts of different goose plumage regions. The regions with the highest visual saliency (cheek, crown, neck and upper tail coverts) were the ones involved in visual displays to maintain flock cohesion. The Canada goose oblique visual streak is the retinal center for chromatic and achromatic vision, allowing individuals to sample the sky and the ground simultaneously or the horizon depending on head position. Overall, our results show that the Canada goose visual system has features that make it rather different from that of other vertebrates living in open habitats.

A method which purified 30-fold perparations of muscular glucose dehydrogenase from the stomachs of geese and ducks was elaborated. Activity of this enzyme was found to be dependent on presence of free-SH groups, NAD or NADP as coenzymes, and had an optimum at about pH 7-8. The enzyme's activity against 17 different monosaccharides and their derivatives was tested. The best substrate was beta-D-glucose, followed by D-glucose, D-glucosamine and D-xylose. Other compounds such as D-glucose-6-phosphate, D-fructose, D-mannose and 2-deoxyglucose were not oxidized. The enzyme preparation showed presence of enzymes which conduct gluconic acid metabolism.

A kind of bacteria secreting cellulase and showing probiotic attributes was isolated from the cecum of goose and identified as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens by analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequence and named as B. amyloliquefaciens S1. In vitro assays, the enzymatic activity of the strain was determined by the reducing-sugar method, and the proper culture conditions of producing cellulase and some properties of the cellulase were investigated. The cultural mixture of the bacteria had a high cellulase activity of 1.25 U/mL. In order to improve the utilization rate of the cellulase, some properties of the cellulase were studied. The best reaction pH of the enzymes was 7.0 and the optimum reaction temperature was 60°C. The enzyme was a kind of neutral cellulase that possessing strong resistance against heat and acidity. It showed high activity to absorbent cotton, soybean meal, and filter paper. Meanwhile, a gene encoding a kind of cellulase was cloned and prokaryotic expressed in Escherichia coli. The gene had 1500 bp in length, encoding a protein of 55 kDa, which was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. This study explored the possibility of degrading ability of bacteria with its probiotic attributes to enhance digestibility of the feed and gut health of animal. It also provided some basis for its further functional analysis and practical application as a microbial preparation for the breeding.

In this study, we selected three H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs), A/Goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (clades 0), A/Duck/Guangdong/E35/2012 (clade 2.3.2.1) and A/Chicken/Henan/B30/2012 (clade 7.2) isolated from different birds in China, to investigate the pathogenicity and transmission of the viruses in terrestrial birds and waterfowl. To observe the replication and shedding of the H5N1 HPAIVs in birds, the chickens were inoculated intranasally with 10(6) EID50 of GSGD/1/96, 10(3) EID50 of DkE35 and CkB30, and the ducks and geese were inoculated intranasally with 10(6) EID50 of each virus. Meanwhile, the naive contact groups were set up to detect the transmission of the viruses in tested birds. Our results showed that DkE35 was highly pathogenic to chickens and geese, but not fatal to ducks. It could be detected from all the tested organs, oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs, and could transmit to the naive contact birds. GSGD/1/96 could infect chickens, ducks and geese, but only caused death in chickens. It could transmit to the chickens and ducks, but was not transmittable to geese. CkB30 was highly pathogenic to chickens, low pathogenic to ducks and not pathogenic to geese. It could be transmitted to the naive contact chickens, but not to the ducks or geese. Our findings suggested that H5N1 HPAIVs from different birds show different host ranges and tissue tropisms. Therefore, we should enhance serological and virological surveillance of H5N1 HPAIVs, and pay more attention to the pathogenic and antigenic evolution of these viruses.

The overaccumulation of triglycerides in hepatocytes induces hepatic steatosis; however, little is known about the mechanism of goose hepatic steatosis. The aim of this study was to define an experimental model of hepatocellular steatosis with TG overaccumulation and minimal cytotoxicity, using a mixture of various proportions of oleate and palmitate free fatty acids (FFAs) to induce fat-overloading, then using suppressive subtractive hybridization and a quantitative PCR approach to identify genes with higher or lower expression levels after the treatment of cells with FFA mixtures. Overall, 502 differentially expressed clones, representing 21 novel genes and 87 known genes, were detected by SSH. Based on functional clustering, up- and down-regulated genes were mostly related to carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, enzyme activity and signal transduction. The expression of 20 selected clones involved with carbohydrate and lipid metabolism pathways was further studied by quantitative PCR. The data indicated that six clones similar to the genes ChREBP, FoxO1, apoB, IHPK2, KIF1B, and FSP27, which participate in de novo synthesis of fatty acid and secretion of very low density lipoproteins, had significantly lower expression levels in the hepatocytes treated with FFA mixtures. Meanwhile, 13 clones similar to the genes DGAT-1, ACSL1, DHRS7, PPARα, L-FABP, DGAT-2, PCK, ACSL3, CPT-1, A-FABP, PPARβ, MAT, and ALDOB had significantly higher expression levels in the hepatocytes treated with FFA mixtures. These results suggest that several metabolic pathways are altered in goose hepatocytes, which may be useful for further research into the molecular mechanism of goose hepatic steatosis.

A method was developed using high-performance liquid chromatography to assay 4,4'-dinitrocarbanilide (DNC), the active ingredient in Nicarbazin, in eggshells collected from Canada geese fed a formulated feed fortified with Nicarbazin at doses of 0, 125, 250, and 500 microg/g. The method was developed using chicken eggshells fortified with DNC. The method was used to quantify DNC in both the shell-associated membranes and the calcified shell extracellular matrix. These values were compared to those obtained for a composite sample consisting of both the membranes and the calcified shell extracellular matrix. The validated method was used to quantify DNC in eggshells from geese fed fortified feed to ascertain the effect of Nicarbazin feed concentration on shell DNC concentration. DNC levels in the eggshells were highly correlated with feed dose.

Outbreaks of a disease characterized by severe necrotic enteritis occurred among Canada geese (Branta canadensis), lesser snow geese (Anser caerulescens), Ross' geese (A. rossi), and white-fronted geese (A. albifrons) on lakes in Saskatchewan and Manitoba during the autumn of 1983, 1984 and 1985. Ducks using the lakes were apparently not affected. Lesions in the geese closely resembled those described in enteritides in other species associated with the proliferation of Clostridium perfringens in the small intestine. Clostridium perfringens was present in large numbers in the affected areas of the intestine of the geese; other pathogens were not identified. It is hypothesized that an abrupt change in diet as geese begin to feed on grain disrupts the intestinal microflora, allowing C. perfringens to proliferate in the upper small intestine. Toxins produced by the bacteria then cause mucosal necrosis. Protease-inhibitory substances in some grains might also have a role in the disease.

Treatment of S-acyl fatty acid synthase thioester hydrolase from the uropygial gland of Peking duck with pyrenebutylmethanephosphonofluoridate resulted in inactivation of the enzyme with covalent attachment of the pyrene derivative to the enzyme. One mole of the derivative was attached/mol of protein, most probably at the active serine. When avian fatty acid synthase was added to the modified thioesterase, the fluorescence anisotropy of the pyrene derivative increased dramatically. That this increase represented the functionally significant binding between the two proteins was suggested by the fact that increasing salt concentration resulted in concomitant loss in enzyme activity and fluorescence anisotropy. As the synthase concentration increased, anisotropy increased giving a saturation pattern. From a Scatchard plot analysis the association constant for the binding of the two proteins was calculated to be 10(6) M-1 and one-to-one stoichiometry was shown for this association. These results show that fluorescence anisotropy of the pyrene derivative attached to the thioesterase can be used to directly measure the binding of this enzyme to fatty acid synthase.

A reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) procedure for the detection of avian, duck, and goose reovirus (ARV, DRV, and GRV) RNA from cell culture supernatant and clinical samples was established. Based on multiple sequence alignment, a pair of degenerate primers was selected and synthesized. The amplified, cloned, and sequenced 598-base-pair products from the sigmaA-encoding gene fragment from 16 isolates (ranging over 30 years) indicated that the primer regions were well conserved. The sensitivity of this method was determined to be 10(-2) PFU. The specificity of the RT-PCR method was determined by testing specimens containing avian influenza A viruses, Newcastle disease virus, and infectious bronchitis virus, all of which yielded negative results with no discernible background. The efficiency of the system for detection of ARV, DRV, and GRV directly in 71/83 clinical samples was confirmed. The nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that DRV and GRV isolated from China in different locales and years were closely related, showing 97.4-100% homology to each other, but with only 86.7-88.5% identity to DRV 89026. The nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities in the amplified sigmaA-encoding gene were 74.2-78.4% and 86.9-92.0%, respectively, between duck/goose and chicken species. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that GRV and DRV aggregated into the same specified genogroup within subgroup II of the genus Orthoreovirus and are more closely related to ARV than to Nelson Bay virus. Overall, this study developed a sensitive and specific technique for the identification ARV, DRV, and GRV, and sequencing analysis has enhanced our understanding of the evolutionary relationship between ARV, DRV, and GRV.

Hen egg lysozyme elicits a sweet taste sensation for human beings. Effects of reduction of disulfide bonds, heat treatment, and chemical modification of hen egg lysozyme on both sweetness and hydrolytic activity were investigated. Both the sweetness and enzymatic activities were lost when the intradisulfide linkage in a lysozyme molecule was reduced and S-3-(trimethylated amino) propylated. The sweetness and enzymatic activity of lysozyme were lost on heating at 95 degrees C for 18 h. These facts suggest that tertiary structures of lysozyme are indispensable for eliciting a sweet taste as well as enzymatic activity. Although the modification of carboxyl residues in a lysozyme by glycine methylester or aminomethansulfonic acid resulted in the loss of enzymatic activity by blocking the catalytic residues, the sweetness was fully retained. These results indicate that the sweetness of lysozyme was independent of its enzymatic activity. The lysozyme purified from goose egg white similarly elicited a sweet taste, although goose (g-type) lysozyme is quite different from hen egg lysozyme (c-type) on the basis of structural, immunological, and enzymatic properties. These findings indicate that a specific protein property of lysozyme is required for sweetness elicitation and that the enzymatic activity and carbohydrates produced by enzymatic reaction are not related to the sweet taste.

A goose flock farmed outdoors in south-eastern Queensland suffered an outbreak of peracute disease with high death rate (97%). Small button ulcers and large plaques overlying lymphocyte aggregates were present on the mucosa of the small intestine of affected birds. Small white foci of necrosis and focal haemorrhages were seen in the livers. Numerous intranuclear inclusion bodies were observed microscopically in hepatocytes and a herpesvirus which grew rapidly in chicken kidney cells was isolated from tissues. Duck virus enteritis (DVE) was suspected but DVE antiserums failed to neutralise the virus. Further serological studies with a limited range of known avian herpesviruses have failed to identify the virus. Experimental transmission resulted in high mortality in geese (100%), lower mortality in ducklings and nil mortality in chickens. Surveillance studies showed no evidence of infection in domestic and wild birds beyond the original farm and the infection appears not to have been established in the area. Wild ducks, which were frequent visitors to the farm dam, were considered the most likely source of the infection.

An attenuated Derzsy's disease virus strain, designated BAV, was studied in goose embryos. A total of 248 embryonated goose eggs, coming from a susceptible laying flock with no yolk-derived immunity (group I) and from a vaccinated laying flock (group II) were used. The eggs were inoculated into the allantoic cavity with 10(1.9), 10(2.9) or 10(3.9) EID 50/0.2 ml virus on day 12 or day 20 of incubation. Embryos were killed at 5-day intervals. The dead embryos and the hatched goslings (up to 2 weeks of age) were examined by gross and histopathological methods. Reisolation of the virus from the organs was attempted, serum samples were tested for the presence of antibodies, and lymphocytes separated from the circulating blood were used in the lymphocyte stimulation and immunorosette formation tests. Embryos of both groups I and II, inoculated at either time of incubation, showed a body mass gain inferior to that of the controls. Sixteen (group I) and 12 (group II) of the embryos inoculated on day 12 of incubation died. Some (group I: 15, group II: 6) of the embryos inoculated on day 20 of incubation failed to hatch. The pathomorphological changes seen in the embryos killed between days 17 and 22 of incubation were of degenerative character. In embryos killed later (between days 23 and 58 of incubation) the degenerative changes were accompanied by infiltration by inflammatory cells. Reisolation of the virus strain was mostly successful between postinoculation (PI) days 5 and 10. Specific virus-neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune response were demonstrable already at hatching.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).

Clinical toxoplasmosis in chickens (Gallus domesticus) has been rarely reported in literature. Here we report that three chickens on a farm in Illinois developed neurological signs. One of these chickens was examined postmortem and it had non-suppurative encephalitis with numerous Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites and tissue cysts. The identity of the protozoa was confirmed immunohistochemically by staining with T. gondii specific antibodies, and by transmission electron microscopy. The owner of the 3 chickens donated all 11 remaining chickens and a goose on his property for the present study. All 11 chickens and a goose were euthanized, and blood, heart, brain, and 1 leg were obtained for T. gondii examination. Antibodies to T. gondii were found in sera of all chickens with titers of 1:40 in one, 1:320 in three, and 1:640 or higher in seven chickens tested by the modified agglutination test (MAT). The goose had a MAT titer of 1:320. For isolation of T. gondii, whole heart and brain and 50 g of leg muscles were digested in an acid-pepsin solution and bioassayed in four mice for each tissue. Viable T. gondii was isolated from tissues of all 11 chickens and the goose. Genotyping of these 12 T. gondii isolates using polymorphism at the genetic loci SAG1, SAG2, SAG3, BTUB, GRA6, c22-8, c29-2, L358, PK1, a new SAG2 and Apico revealed that all isolates had Type II alleles at all loci, indicating these T. gondii isolates belong to the predominant clonal Type II lineages. This is the first report of isolation of viable T. gondii from a domestic goose (Anser anser).

The chemical nature and variations in serum concentrations of growth hormone binding protein (GHBP) from humans, rabbits, and rodents have been reported. To date little is known about the GHBP of domestic animals. Therefore, we initiated these studies to determine whether a serum GHBP was present in domestic animals and to purify the binding protein (BP) from serum of selected species. Using a dextran-coated charcoal separation assay, specific growth hormone (GH) binding was demonstrated in ovine, bovine, chicken, human, goose, porcine, and equine serum (listed in sequence from lowest to highest binding). Variation in BP activity was relatively high, both within and between species. Yearling ewes had higher serum GHBP than either prepubertal (4 mo) or older (5 yr) ewes. The GHBP was partially purified from chicken, ovine, and porcine serum using GH affinity chromatography. These BP had high affinity (Ka = 2 x 10(8) to 2 x 10(9) L/mol, depending on species) and low capacity (2 x 10(-10) to 5 x 10(-11) mol/unit of protein) for human GH but showed lower binding affinity for homologous GH (Ka = 2 x 10(7) L/mol). The porcine GHBP had the highest and ovine GHBP the lowest affinity for human GH. Other heterologous somatotropic hormones, ovine placental lactogen, and ovine GH displayed higher binding affinity to chicken and pig BP than the respective homologous hormones. Further chromatographic purification of the porcine GHBP resulted in an additional 1,000-fold purification. The estimated molecular weight of porcine GHBP is 50,000 to 60,000 Da. These results demonstrate that the serum from all domestic species tested contains a specific GH-binding moiety and that under the conditions described here human GH is a more efficient ligand than the homologous hormone.

Despite the recognized importance of fecal/oral transmission of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) via contaminated wetlands, little is known about the length, quantity, or route of AI virus shed by wild waterfowl. We used published laboratory challenge studies to evaluate the length and quantity of low pathogenic (LP) and highly pathogenic (HP) virus shed via oral and cloacal routes by AI-infected ducks and geese, and how these factors might influence AI epidemiology and virus detection. We used survival analysis to estimate the duration of infection (from virus inoculation to the last day virus was shed) and nonlinear models to evaluate temporal patterns in virus shedding. We found higher mean virus titer and longer median infectious period for LPAI-infected ducks (10-11.5 days in oral and cloacal swabs) than HPAI-infected ducks (5 days) and geese (7.5 days). Based on the median bird infectious dose, we found that environmental contamination is two times higher for LPAI- than HPAI-infectious ducks, which implies that susceptible birds may have a higher probability of infection during LPAI than HPAI outbreaks. Less environmental contamination during the course of infection and previously documented shorter environmental persistence for HPAI than LPAI suggest that the environment is a less favorable reservoir for HPAI. The longer infectious period, higher virus titers, and subclinical infections with LPAI viruses favor the spread of these viruses by migratory birds in comparison to HPAI. Given the lack of detection of HPAI viruses through worldwide surveillance, we suggest monitoring for AI should aim at improving our understanding of AI dynamics (in particular, the role of the environment and immunity) using long-term comprehensive live bird, serologic, and environmental sampling at targeted areas. Our findings on LPAI and HPAI shedding patterns over time provide essential information to parameterize environmental transmission and virus spread in predictive epizootiologic models of disease risks.

In April, 1973, an acute disease with a high rate of mortality appeared in a flock of 233 ducks and geese at a private game farm. Most of the flock (220) were black ducks (Anas rubripes) and mortality was restricted to them. In May, the remaining live birds were placed in isolation but mortality continued in black ducks and occurred in other species. The overall rate of mortality for black ducks was 93% and the case fatality rate was 97%. No hemorrhaging from either the bill or vent was observed. The most commonly observed gross lesions were extensive fibrino-necrotic plaques covering the mucosal surface of the esophagus, posterior colon and cloaca. Petechial and ecchymotic hemorrhages on visceral organs, particularly the heart, were also common. Virus isolation was attempted from tissues of three black ducks. Duck plague virus was isolated from liver, kidney, spleen and intestine of each. Sixteen black ducks survived the outbreak. Seven of these birds had significant levels of neutralizing antibody to duck plague virus.

A direct radioimmunoassay for the determination of avian adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) in a small volume of plasma was developed using an antiserum specific for N-terminal region of the ACTH molecule. The sensitivity of the two stage assay is 0.1 fmol ACTH/tube. The specificity of the antiserum was tested by its cross reactions with synthetic ACTH fragments and by comparing curves obtained by dilution of different plasma specimens to that of ACTH reference standard. Adrenocorticotropin responses of chronically cannulated geese to ether stress were evaluated and compared to changes of plasma corticosterone (B) concentration over a 2-hr period. ACTH showed a maximum between 5 and 10 min after ether exposure, while B peak appeared 10-15 min later. Thirty minutes after ether inhalation plasma ACTH returned to the baseline, while B response was longer-lasting and decreased to the resting level between 60 and 120 min. Basal and stress-induced ACTH plasma levels were also investigated in male and female gonadectomized and thyroidectomized geese. Castration increased, while thyroidectomy decreased the basal ACTH concentration. These endocrine manipulations did not, however, markedly affect the stress-induced ACTH hypersecretion except in thyroidectomized ganders, where the increment of plasma ACTH 10 min after ether inhalation was significantly lower than in sham operated control geese.

We collected 430 harvested ducks (Anas sp. and Aythya sp.) from nine prefectures in Japan between 1994 and 1997. Fifteen (4%) of 363 birds harvested during and after hunting seasons had one lead pellet each in the proventriculus and gizzard. In addition, 32 (34%) of 93 swans (Cygnus sp.) and two of 14 geese (Anser sp.) found dead from various wetlands had lesions consistent with lead poisoning. One to nine swans suspected of having toxicosis from ingestion of lead shot were found dead each year. Twenty-seven (84%) of the 32 lead-exposured swans were found in Hokkaido Prefecture. We concluded that lead poisoning is still a serious threat to waterfowl in Japan and that there is considerable need for environmental improvement concerning this problem.

Up to 25% mortality occurred in goslings between 8 and 28 days of age in three sequential hatches from a closed breeder flock on a single farm. The birds died suddenly with minor ascites, subcutaneous and myocardial hemorrhages, and pale, mottled livers with petechial hemorrhages. Liver necrosis associated with intranuclear inclusion bodies was seen on histology. Virus particles were found on examination of the inclusion bodies with an electron microscope. Liver homogenates caused variable mortality 7 to 17 days postinoculation in goose embryos, some of which had hepatic necrosis and intranuclear inclusion bodies. Experimental goslings inoculated with material from these infected embryos died from hepatitis.

Methods to assess the impact of goose fecal contamination are needed as the result of the increasing number of Canada geese (Branta canadensis) near North American inland waters. However, there is little information on goose fecal microbial communities, and such data are important for the development of host-specific source-tracking methods. To address this issue, 16S rRNA gene clone libraries for Canada goose fecal samples from Ontario, Canada, and Ohio were analyzed. Analyses of fecal clones from Ontario (447) and Ohio (302) showed that goose fecal communities are dominated by the classes "Clostridia" (represented by 33.7% of clones) and "Bacilli" (38.1% of clones) and the phylum "Bacteroidetes" (10.1% of clones). Sequences not previously found in other avian fecal communities were used to develop host-specific assays. Fecal DNA extracts from sewage plants (10 samples) and different species of birds (11 samples) and mammals (18 samples) were used to test for host specificity. Of all the assays tested, one assay showed specificity for Canada goose fecal DNA. The PCR assay was positive for Canada goose fecal DNA extracts collected from three locations in North America (Ohio, Oregon, and Ontario, Canada). Additionally, of 48 DNA extracts from Lake Ontario waters presumed to be impacted by waterfowl feces, 19 tested positive by the assay, although 10 were positive only after a nested PCR approach was used. Due to the level of host specificity and the presence of signals in environmental waters, the assay is proposed as a part of the toolbox to detect Canada goose contamination in waterfowl-contaminated waters.

Cryptosporidiosis, giardiasis and microsporidiosis are serious human diseases of waterborne origin; their etiologic agents and a substantial fecal coliform load can enter surface, drinking and recreational water resources from aquatic birds. The aim of this article is to present interactions between waterfowl and these waters that imply a negative public health impact, reinforcing the need for either better water-quality indicators or for water monitoring specifically for Cryptosporidium, Giardia and microsporidia. Where justifiable, the presence of waterfowl should be supported; however, management of drinking and recreational water resources needs to be improved by incorporating effective protection measures for pathogens linked to these birds.

The second phase of a 2-year influenza virus surveillance programme of domestic avian species in Hong Kong (up to October 1977) yielded influenza A virus, Newcastle disease virus, and Hong Kong paramyxovirus, as well as unidentified haemagglutinating agents. These viruses were isolated from the trachea or cloaca of apparently healthy domestic ducks, geese, and chickens originating from China and Hong Kong. Twenty-five combinations of haemagglutinin and neuraminidase surface antigens were identified from the 136 influenza A viruses isolated. Eight of the combinations do not appear to have been previously reported - Hav3Nav2, Hav4Nav2, Hav4Nav4, Hav4Nav5, Hav4Neq1, Hav6Nav4, Hav6Nav6, and Hav9Nav1. The existence of such a diverse pool of influenza virus genetic information may play a role in the emergence of new human pandemic strains.

We have completely sequenced the genome of an isolate of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) obtained following an outbreak in geese. The genomic sequence consists of 15192 nt, which is six nt longer than the published full length genome of the NDV strains La Sota, B1, Clone-30, Beaudette C and HB V4. The six nt insertion was located in the non-coding region of the nucleoprotein (NP) gene between nt 1646 and nt 1647 of the NDV genome (numbered according to the genomic sequence of the La Sota strain). An additional 22 NDV strains were searched for the existence of this six nt insertion. NDVs in genotypes VI, VII, VIII and IX had this insertion while NDV's in genotypes I, II, III, IV, and V did not. The significance of this insertion in NDV evolution is discussed.

The cat gene, coding for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase has been reported for conferring the chloramphenicol resistance for Riemerella anatipestifer. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferases, however, are unable to inactivate florfenicol. In this study, 66 R. anatipestifer isolates were investigated for their susceptibility to chloramphenicol and florfenicol and the presence of floR gene. Results showed nine florfenicol intermediate or resistant R. anatipestifer isolates were all floR positive. The expression of floR gene in E. coli and inhibition studies with PAβN indicated that the floR gene was as an efflux pump conferring resistance to both chloramphenicol and florfenicol. Southern hybridization revealed the floR was located in the plasmid DNA of five isolates and in the chromosomal DNA of four isolates. Furthermore, two novel floR-carrying plasmids designated pRA0726 and pRA0846 were sequenced completely. pRA0726 was 11,704 bp in size with 10 putative open reading frames which included the floR, catB and bla(OXA-209) resistance genes. The most differences between sequences of pRA0846 and pRA0726 were the absence of a bla(OXA-209) gene and the deletion of 321 nucleotides of orf1 in pRA0846. Plasmid curing tests demonstrated that pRA0726 carried functional coding proteins for resistance to phenicol and β-lactam antimicrobials. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of presence of the floR and bla(OXA-209) resistance genes in R. anatipestifer.

Astroviruses are recognized as a leading cause of gastroenteritis in humans and animals. They are also associated with extra-intestinal diseases, such as hepatitis in ducklings, nephritis in chickens, and encephalitis in cattle. In February 2017, a fatal infection of goslings characterized by visceral urate deposition was reported in the Shandong province, China. Our systematic investigation led to the isolation of an astrovirus, designated AAstV/Goose/CHN/2017/SD01, and similar disease was reproduced by experimental infection of healthy goslings, fulfilling Koch's postulates. The isolated astrovirus replicated well and resulted in 100% mortality of goose embryos. Complete genome sequence analysis revealed that the isolate was genetically distinct from known astroviruses and closely related to members of the avastrovirus genogroup II. Experimental infection showed that the isolate was highly pathogenic in goslings, causing clinical signs, growth repression and in many cases mortality. Histopathological examination indicated that lesions occurred mainly in the kidneys of infected birds. However, virus-specific genomic RNA was detected in all representative tissues, and virus shedding was detected up to 12 days after inoculation, suggesting that the isolate was able to spread systemically and replicate efficiently in vivo. Collectively, our study demonstrates, for the first time, the etiological role of a genetically distinct astrovirus in the fatal infection of goslings.

The binding of pertussis toxin and its subunits to cell surface receptors and purified glycoproteins was examined. The interaction of pertussis toxin with components of two variant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines was studied. These cell lines are deficient in either sialic acid residues (LEC 2) or sialic acid and galactose residues (LEC 8) on cell surface macromolecules. The binding of pertussis toxin to components of these cells differed from the binding of the toxin to wild-type components. Although the toxin bound to a 165,000-dalton glycoprotein found in N-octylglucoside extracts of wild-type cells, it did not bind to components found in extracts of LEC 2 cells. In contrast, the toxin bound to components found in extracts of LEC 8 cells, which are variant cells that contain increased amounts of terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues on cell surface macromolecules. These results suggest that the receptor for pertussis toxin on CHO cells contains terminal acetamido-containing sugars. The cytopathic effect of the toxin on both types of variant cells was much reduced compared with its effects on wild-type cells. Thus, optimal functional binding of pertussis toxin appears to require a complete sialyllactosamine (NeuAc----Gal beta 4GlcNAc) sequence on surface macromolecules. In addition to studying the nature of the eucaryotic receptor for pertussis toxin, we examined corresponding binding sites for glycoproteins on the toxin molecule. Binding of both S2-S4 and S3-S4 dimers of the toxin to cellular components and purified glycoproteins was observed. The two dimers bound to a number of glycoproteins containing N-linked oligosaccharides but not O-linked oligosaccharides, and differences in the binding of the two dimers to some glycoproteins was noted. These data indicate that the holotoxin molecule contains at least two glycoprotein-binding sites which may have slightly different specificities for glycoproteins.

The abundant fatty acid synthase in the uropygial gland of goose generates multimethyl-branched fatty acids as the major product because of the unique presence of the cytoplasmic malonyl-CoA decarboxylase which assures that only methylmalonyl-CoA is available to the synthase. If this conclusion is valid, the developmental pattern of expression of the gene for this tissue-specific decarboxylase should correlate with the appearance of other lipogenic enzymes and the production of the unique lipids. To test this possibility the levels of the decarboxylase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and fatty acid synthase in the gland of the embryonic and neonatal goose were measured by immunodiffusion and immunoblot assays for the proteins as well as the enzyme assays for the catalytic activities. Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase appeared several days before hatching as did the other two lipogenic enzymes and reached half-maximal levels by hatching. The levels of expression of the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene and cytoplasmic actin gene, which is not expected to be developmentally regulated, were measured by dot-blot analysis using cloned cDNA for the two proteins. The decarboxylase transcripts appeared 4 days prior to hatching and reached maximal levels by hatching, whereas the levels of cytoplasmic actin gene transcripts showed very little change. The appearance of oil droplets in the glands was clearly seen soon after hatching. These results show that malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene expression is developmentally regulated in a manner consistent with its proposed role in the synthesis of the unique lipids of the uropygial gland.

Since nontraumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head is usually considered primarily as an ischemic disease, blood flow has been studied in femoral segments in two groups of geese, one control group and the other treated with a high dose of corticosteroids for 5 months. There was no histologic evidence of osteonecrosis in femoral heads, and mean bone blood flow in any femoral segments was not reduced in the treated group. These results suggest that osteonecrosis of the femoral head is not caused primarily by ischemia, even if ischemia may play a secondary role in the evolution of the disorder.

Lead (Pb) exposure results in an increase in tissue lipid peroxides and variation in glutathione (GSH) concentrations, which can be related to peroxidative damage of cell membranes in Pb-poisoned animals. Species and individual variation in sensitivity to Pb poisoning among animals may be due to differential resistance to oxidative stress. The effects of oxidative stress caused by Pb exposure (1.7, 414, and 828 microg/g of diet) were compared for the first 6 wk in growing young of two species of waterfowl, Canada geese (Branta canadensis) and mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), with the first species being possibly more sensitive to Pb poisoning based on previous field and laboratory observations. Blood and liver Pb concentrations increased more in mallards than in geese. This may be explained on the basis of body weight, being 3.2 times higher in geese, and by hepatic metabolism, where GSH S-transferase (GST) activity is 2.9-fold higher in geese and presumably has a role in the binding of Pb to GSH and subsequent biliary excretion. In contrast, mallards showed higher hepatic levels of GSH and activities of CSH peroxidase (GPX) and GSH reductase (GR). Although both species showed a rise in hepatic GSH concentration with Pb exposure, the relationship between increased lipid peroxidation and Pb exposure was only significant in geese. Within treatment groups, hepatic GSH concentrations were inversely related to liver Pb concentrations in both species, which may correspond to the role of GSH in Pb excretion. Hepatic GSH was also inversely related to hepatic lipid peroxidation, but only in mallards and in agreement with the species differences observed in GPX and GR activities. The lower resistance to lipid peroxidation of Canada geese may explain why geese can die in the field from Pb poisoning after ingesting fewer shot than found in the gizzards of mallards and with lower liver Pb concentrations than in mallards.

In order to study the tenderization mechanism of ATP treatments by depolymerizing actin filaments, breast muscles of Eastern Zhejiang White Geese were randomly divided into 3 groups: control, 10 and 20 mM groups. Shear force (SF), sarcomere length (SL) and myofibrillar fraction index (MFI), the content of F-actin and G-actin, the expression of actin associated proteins (cofilins and tropomodulins) were investigated during conditioning. In 20 mM group, cofilins content increased from 48 to 168 h, while tropomodulins decreased; the content of F-actin decreased from 24 to 168 h, while the increased G-actin was observed upto 48 h. In the control, the degraded tropomodulins were observed at 168 h, and the increased cofilins and G-actin were detected at the same time; the increase of MFI and decrease of F-actin content were shown at 96 and 168 h. Compared to control group, 20 mM group accelerated the transformation of F-actin into G-actin; it showed higher SL and MFI, and lower SF at 48, 96 and 168 h, respectively. We concluded that depolymerization of actin filaments, which was regulated by cofilins and tropomodulins, contributed to myofibrillar fraction and low SF during conditioning.

Various factors affecting the HAI test for the quantitation of rabies-specific antibodies have been evaluated with a view to obtaining maximum sensitivity and reproducibility in tests using tissue culture antigens prepared in vero cells and concentrated by dialysis. Goose erythrocytes treated with proteolytic enzyme bromelian at a concentration of 0.025% were much more susceptible to HA than those that were untreated or erythrocytes treated with neuraminidase. In addition, other parameters like the use of a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) as a diluent at pH 6.2, incubation at 0-4 degrees C for 1.5-3 h were found to be most critical for achieving maximum HA activity. To remove non-specific inhibitors, serum samples were treated with aerosil, acetone in combination or alone. Of the 73 serum samples tested, removal of non-specific inhibitors by aerosil alone occurred in up to 54.79% of the samples, whereas using acetone-aerosil treatment followed by adsorption with goose erythrocytes, the inhibitors were removed in 98.67% of the samples to a level that was undetectable at the 1:4 starting dilution in the HAI test.

Three H5N1 influenza viruses were isolated from shell washes of duck and goose eggs confiscated from travelers coming from Vietnam. All eight gene segments of these viruses share high sequence identity with the H5N1 avian influenza viruses that caused outbreaks in poultry and humans in Hong Kong in 1997. Animal studies indicate that these isolated viruses are able to replicate in mouse lung and could be found in the organs of ducks without causing any clinical signs or death. However, the viruses are highly pathogenic for chickens. Although the source of these recently isolated Hong Kong 97-like H5N1 viruses is undetermined, their detection in the egg shell of duck and goose suggests that this particular genotype of H5N1 virus may have re-emerged in nature or may have been circulating continuously.

In 2017, a new type of goose-origin astrovirus (GoAstV) that is completely different from previously identified avian astroviruses (which have only 30.0% to 50.5% homology with GoAstV) has been isolated from diseased geese in China. This disease can cause joint swelling in sick geese, and the anatomy shows a clear precipitation of urate in the kidney. The rate of death and culling can reach more than 30%, revealing the disease's severe pathogenicity. To quickly and accurately diagnose the newly emerging disease, we established a highly specific reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) method of detecting GoAstV. Sensitivity testing showed that the minimum amount of test sample for this method is 52.5 copies/μl. Clinical application confirmed that this method can quickly and effectively detect GoAstV, providing a diagnostic platform for the prevention and control of goose disease.IMPORTANCE Goose-origin astrovirus (GoAstV), as a newly emerging virus in 2017, is different from previously known astroviruses in the genus Avastrovirus So far, few studies have focused on the novel virus. Considering the infectious development of astrovirus (AstV), we established a reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assay with a strong specificity to quickly and accurately diagnose GoAstV. Confirmed by clinical application, this method can quickly and accurately detect prevalent GoAstV. The assay is thus convenient for clinical operation and is applicable to the monitoring of GoAstV disease.

The prevalence, count and molecular identification of Campylobacter spp. in Polish poultry meat were analysed. 181 samples of meat from chicken (70), turkey (47), duck (54) and goose (10) were studied. Campylobacter spp. was found in 64% of meat samples. The highest prevalence of this pathogen was detected for duck meat. On average 80% of duck samples were contaminated with Campylobacter spp. The counts of Campylobacter spp. in positive samples remained under ten colony forming units per gram of product in 59% of poultry meat. C. jejuni was more frequently detected in poultry meat than C. coli.

The aim of this study was to investigate how long-term feeding of ganders with diets containing different levels of phytoestrogens affects the morphometry of testes, plasma steroid levels, sperm parameters and reproductive performance. Male Bilgoraj geese were fed diets containing grass meal (with low phytoestrogen levels) and those containing alfalfa meal and soybean meal (with higher levels of phytoestrogens). Testes were obtained from ganders at the peak of mating and the ongoing laying period as well as at the beginning of photorefractoriness. The morphometric parameters were measured in frozen testicular sections. Blood was collected monthly from December to June, and plasma testosterone, androstenedione and corticosterone concentrations were determined. During the mating season, semen was collected and its quantity and quality were investigated. In the flocks (ganders with geese) reproductive output was noted. Seasonal changes were observed in the morphology of testes and in plasma testosterone, androstenedione and corticosterone concentrations in ganders. The feeding of ganders with dietary meals containing higher levels of phytoestrogens did not affect the plasma steroid contents or the majority of the morphometric parameters of testes, except for the height of the seminiferous epithelium, which was lowered. Moreover, diets with higher levels of phytoestrogens decreased the volume of ejaculates and the percentage of normal spermatozoa. However, these changes were not reflected in the fertilisation rates.

Duck Tembusu virus (TMUV) is an emerging flavivirus that has caused variable levels of outbreaks in poultry in recent years. In order to study the effect of age and inoculation routes on the TMUV infection, one hundred healthy domestic 5-day-old and 20-day-old goslings were equally divided into five groups and four experimental groups of goslings were infected with the TMUV-SDSG strain by intravenous and intranasal routes, respectively. Severe clinical signs were observed in goslings infected at 5 days of age, including listlessness, growth retardation, severe neurological dysfunction and even death. However, goslings infected at 20 days of age showed mild symptoms and no mortality. The severity of gross lesions gradually reduced as goslings matured. The severe histopathological changes were observed in 5-day-old infected goslings, including cerebral edema, viral encephalitis, myocardial necrosis, hepatic steatosis, spleen lymphoid cell depletion, pancreatic epithelial cell shedding and interstitial hemorrhage. However, 20-day-old infected goslings showed mild histopathological changes. Viral loads in different tissues were detected by the SYBR Green I real-time PCR assay. The level of viral loads in most of tissues 5-day-old infected goslings was higher than that of 20-day-old infected goslings, correlating with the severity of clinical symptoms and lesions in these tissues. 20-day-old infected goslings developed significantly higher serum neutralizing antibody titers than 5-day-old infected goslings. Furthermore, goslings infected with TMUV intravenously demonstrated more severe clinical signs, lesions and higher viral loads in tissues than those of goslings infected with TMUV intranasally. Therefore, age and inoculation routes can affect the pathogenicity of TMUV in geese and younger geese are more susceptible to the virus. Age and inoculation route factors should be considered in study of the pathogenicity, pathogenesis, folumation of prevention and therapy strategies of TMUV infection in geese.

Public health departments bear the responsibility for investigating recreational water-associated disease outbreaks. Tracking the source of the disease is often problematic, however, because routine monitoring of recreational waters (for bacterial counts) is not source specific. The intent of the project reported here was to monitor Escherichia coli levels in a small recreational lake in Iowa and to determine their source. The authors monitored water samples for E. coli and used phenotypic methods to analyze multiple samples of lake water, well water, and known fecal sources. Moderate to high levels of E. coli were found in lake water samples from the swimming area throughout the summer. The highest levels of E. coli were found after rainfall events in both lake water samples and samples taken from monitoring wells. Phenotypic analyses indicated that likely sources of E. coli in the lake included both human and wildlife (goose) fecal material. The authors also found that the phenotype used to characterize E. coli isolated from geese frequenting this lake could not be used to characterize E. coli isolated from geese in a neighboring watershed. Identifying the source of fecal material will help authorities implement the proper preventive measures to avoid fecal contamination of the lake in the future.

Polymerase chain reaction and sequencing were used to analyse goose parvovirus field isolates and vaccine strains. Two fragments of the genome were amplified. Fragment "A" represents a region of VP3 gene, while fragment "B" represents a region upstream of the VP3 gene, encompassing part of the VP1 gene. In the region of fragment "A" the deduced amino acid sequence of the strains was identical, therefore differentiation among strains could be done only at the nucleotide level, which resulted in the formation of three groups: Hungarian, West-European and Asian strains. In the region of fragment "B", separation of groups could be done by both nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence level. The nucleotide sequences resulted in the same groups as for fragment "A" but with a different clustering pattern among the Hungarian strains. Within the "Hungarian" group most of the recent field isolates fell into one cluster, very closely related or identical to each other, indicating a very slow evolutionary change. The attenuated strains and field isolates from 1979/80 formed a separate cluster. When vaccine strains and field isolates were compared, two specific amino acid differences were found that can be considered as possible markers for vaccinal strains. Sequence analysis of fragment "B" seems to be a suitable method for differentiation of attenuated vaccine strains from virulent strains.

We defined the nucleotide-sequence of the full-length goose serum amyloid A and compared it to SAA sequences of the duck. The aim of this work was to clone and express recombinant goose SAA and to produce antibody against this protein: Total RNA was isolated from goose liver and used to synthesise first strand cDNA. The coding region of the goose SAA cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers corresponding to the appropriate conservative regions of duck SAA mRNA. The product was subcloned into pET-15b expression vector to result in a His*Tag fusion protein expression. The protein was purified by affinity chromatography. Rabbits were then immunized against the recombinant purified goose SAA protein. The anti-SAA serum was tested by Western blotting. Full-length goose SAA mRNA sequence has been obtained and sequenced.

1. Fatty acid synthase from goose uropygial gland was inhibited when CoA was scavenged with ATP citrate lyase. 2. This inhibition was reversed by the addition of CoA, 3'-dephospho-CoA, 1,N6-etheno-CoA and pantetheine but not by desulfo-CoA, pantethine or mercaptoethanol suggesting that the structural features of pantetheine including the free thiol group are essential for the reversal. 3. The S-acyl fatty acid synthase thioester hydrolase from the uropygial glands of mallards, which hydrolytically removes acyl chains from fatty acid synthase of goose uropygial gland in the absence of CoA, did not reverse this inhibition, suggesting that the CoA depletion does not inhibit termination reaction. 4. However, triacetic acid lactone synthesis by the fatty acid synthase was inhibited by the scavenging of CoA, raising the possibility that the condensation and/or the transacylase reactions may require CoA.

Mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) is an essential adaptor protein in retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-mediated antiviral innate immunity in mammals. In this study, the goose MAVS gene (goMAVS) was identified. The 2019 bp-long goMAVS exhibits 96.2% amino acid similarity compared to the predicted goMAVS. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions showed that goMAVS mRNA was widely expressed in different tissues. The overexpression of goMAVS in goose embryo fibroblast cells up-regulated the mRNA levels of goose interferon-stimulated genes. We concluded that MAVS mediates the activation of type I interferon (IFN) pathway in a species-specific manner. We further demonstrated that a CARD-like domain, transmembrane domain and two previously unidentified domains of goMAVS were essential for the activation of type I IFN pathway. GoMAVS inhibited Newcastle disease virus replication by activating type I IFN pathways, especially at the early stages of infection. Finally, the interaction between goMAVS and goose RIG-I was confirmed. The CARD domain of goMAVS plays a vital role in the interaction. Together, we identified goMAVS as a goRIG-I interactive protein and concluded that goMAVS is involved in the activation of type I IFN pathways in goose cells.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses were introduced to Hungary during 2006-2007 in three separate waves. This study aimed at determining the full-length genomic coding regions of the index strains from these epizootics in order to: (i) understand the phylogenetic relationship to other European H5N1 isolates, (ii) elucidate the possible connection between the different outbreaks and (iii) determine the putative origin and way of introduction of the different virus variants. Molecular analysis of the HA gene of Hungarian HPAI isolates obtained from wild birds during the first introduction revealed two groups designated Hungarian1 (HUN1) and Hungarian2 (HUN2) within sublineage 2.2B and clade 2.2.1, respectively. Sequencing the whole coding region of the two index viruses A/mute swan/Hungary/3472/2006 and A/mute swan/4571/Hungary/2006 suggests the role of wild birds in the introduction of HUN1 and HUN2 viruses: the most similar isolates to HUN1 and HUN2 group were found in wild avian species in Croatia and Slovakia, respectively. The second introduction of HPAI H5N1 led to the largest epizootic in domestic waterfowl in Europe. The index strain of the epizootic A/goose/Hungary/14756/2006 clustered to sublineage 2.2.A1 forming the Hungarian3 (HUN3) group. A common ancestry of HUN3 isolates with Bavarian strains is suggested as the most likely scenario of origin. Hungarian4 (HUN4) viruses isolated from the third introduction clustered with isolate A/turkey/United Kingdom/750/2007 forming a sublineage 2.2.A2. The origin and way of introduction of HUN4 viruses is still obscure, thus further genetic, phylogenetic, ecological and epidemiological data are required in order to elucidate it.

A unique pattern of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 outbreaks has emerged along the Central Asia Flyway, where infection of wild birds has been reported with steady frequency since 2005. We assessed the potential for two hosts of HPAI H5N1, the bar-headed goose (Anser indicus) and ruddy shelduck (Tadorna tadorna), to act as agents for virus dispersal along this 'thoroughfare'. We used an eco-virological approach to compare the migration of 141 birds marked with GPS satellite transmitters during 2005-2010 with: 1) the spatio-temporal patterns of poultry and wild bird outbreaks of HPAI H5N1, and 2) the trajectory of the virus in the outbreak region based on phylogeographic mapping. We found that biweekly utilization distributions (UDs) for 19.2% of bar-headed geese and 46.2% of ruddy shelduck were significantly associated with outbreaks. Ruddy shelduck showed highest correlation with poultry outbreaks owing to their wintering distribution in South Asia, where there is considerable opportunity for HPAI H5N1 spillover from poultry. Both species showed correlation with wild bird outbreaks during the spring migration, suggesting they may be involved in the northward movement of the virus. However, phylogeographic mapping of HPAI H5N1 clades 2.2 and 2.3 did not support dissemination of the virus in a northern direction along the migration corridor. In particular, two subclades (2.2.1 and 2.3.2) moved in a strictly southern direction in contrast to our spatio-temporal analysis of bird migration. Our attempt to reconcile the disciplines of wild bird ecology and HPAI H5N1 virology highlights prospects offered by both approaches as well as their limitations.

Bacterial production in glacial runoff and aquatic habitats along a c. 500 m transect from the ablation area of a Svalbard glacier (Midre Lovénbreen, 79 degrees N, 12 degrees E) down to a series of proglacial lakes in its forefield were assessed. In addition, a series of in situ experiments were conducted to test how different nutrient sources (glacial flour and dissolved organic matter derived from goose faeces) and temperature affect bacterial abundance and production in these ecosystems. Bacterial abundance and production increased significantly along this transect and reached a maximum in the proglacial lakes. Bacterial diversity profiles as assessed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis indicated that communities in glacial runoff were different from those in proglacial lakes. Heterotrophic bacterial production was mainly controlled by temperature and phosphorus limitation. Addition of both glacial flour and dissolved organic matter derived from goose faeces stimulated bacterial production in those lakes. The results suggest that glacial runoff sustains an active bacterial community which is further stimulated in proglacial lakes by higher temperatures and nutrient inputs from bird faeces. Thus, as in maritime temperate and Antarctic settings, bacterial communities developing in the recently deglaciated terrain of Svalbard receive important inputs of nutrients via faunal transfers from adjacent ecosystems.

Three strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from the faeces of apparently healthy wild Canada geese (Branta canadensis) in 2010 by cultivating faecal LAB on Rogosa SL agar under aerobic conditions. These three isolates were found to share 99.9 % gene sequence similarity of their 16S rRNA, their 16S-23S intergenic transcribed spacer region (ITS), partial 23S rRNA, rpoB, rpoC, rpoA and pheS gene sequences. However, the three strains exhibited lower levels of sequence similarity of these genetic targets to all known LAB, and the phylogenetically closest species to the geese strains were Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus saniviri. In comparison to L. casei ATCC 393(T), L. paracasei ATCC 25302(T), L. rhamnosus ATCC 7469(T) and L. saniviri DSM 24301(T), the novel isolates reacted uniquely in tests for cellobiose, galactose, mannitol, citric acid, aesculin and dextrin, and gave negative results in tests for l-proline arylamidase and l-pyrrolydonyl-arylamidase, and in the Voges-Proskauer test. Biochemical tests for cellobiose, aesculin, galactose, gentiobiose, mannitol, melezitose, ribose, salicin, sucrose, trehalose, raffinose, turanose, amygdalin and arbutin could be used for differentiation between L. saniviri and the novel strains. On the basis of phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, and phylogenetic data, the three isolates represent a novel species of the genus Lactobacillus, for which the name Lactobacillus brantae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SL1108(T) (= ATCC BAA-2142(T) = LMG 26001(T) = DSM 23927(T)) and two additional strains are SL1170 and SL60106.

In this study, an indirect Newcastle disease virus enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for waterfowl was evaluated concerning its efficiency and its suitability to monitor the antibody response in Muscovy ducks (Cairina moschata) and domestic geese (Anser anser var. domestica) following vaccination with a commercial inactivated NDV vaccine for chickens. Three weeks after vaccination seroconversion was already evident in the ELISA. Comparison of the ELISA results with those of the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test provided a positive linear correlation between both tests (Pearson's product-moment correlation; r=0.652; P<0.001). However, a discrepancy of test results was evident in weeks 7 and 10, with 10 sera of vaccinated birds evaluated negative by HI test but positive by ELISA. Eight of these sera were confirmed to yield avian paramyxovirus specific reactivity by western blot analysis. Relative diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were determined to be 100.0% and 91.7% for the ELISA, compared with 91.1% and 97.2% for the HI test. Thus, the established ELISA represents a suitable alternative to the HI test in the monitoring of the immune response of waterfowl after vaccination, particularly for the analysis of high sample numbers. Further on, the results emphasize the immunogenicity of the inactivated Newcastle disease virus vaccine in domestic geese and Muscovy ducks.

During the surveillance of avian influenza viruses in East Dongting Lake, China (2014-2015), two H11N8 avian influenza viruses were detected in the bean goose (Anser fabalis) and the falcated teal (Anas falcata). Phylogenetic analysis showed that these two novel reassortant H11N8 avian influenza viruses contain genes from poultry and wild birds. This is the first report detecting the H11N8 subtype influenza virus from wild birds in Asia. These findings indicate a dissemination of avian influenza virus along the East Asian-Australian flyway. In addition, the interaction between poultry and wild birds was addressed suggesting the need for intensive surveillance of wild bird populations.

(2'-5')Oligoadenylate synthetase (2-5A synthetase) was found in avian erythrocyte lysates from chicken, goose, and pigeon, with high levels being observed in chicken erythrocytes. No activities, however, were detected in erythrocytes from human, sheep, mouse, turtle, frog, trout, or lamprey. In chicken erythrocyte lysate, about 70% of ATP was converted to 2-5A molecules during a 20-h incubation, in which the tri- and tetra-adenylate were the major products. The tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hepta-adenylate were synthesized sequentially, but the levels of the di-adenylate were low throughout the reaction. 2-5A synthetase was also seen in erythrocytes from specific pathogen-free chickens, suggesting that the enzyme was not produced as a result of microbial infections. 2-5A synthetases from avian erythrocytes of chicken and pigeon were found not only in cytoplasms, but also in nuclei. No enzyme activity, however, was detected in the nuclear fraction of goose erythrocytes. The molecular size of 2-5A synthetase in nuclei from chicken erythrocytes was 45,000-60,000 daltons, while cytoplasms contained an 85,000- to 120,000-dalton enzyme. In addition, the synthetase was present in several types of chicken tissue including liver, intestine, bone marrow, spleen, bursa, pancreas, and thymus, but not in brain, heart, or stomach.

To further investigate into the prevalence of F1 fimbriae and high pathogenicity island (HPI) in avian Escherichia coli, a total of 69 bacteria isolates (29 from geese and 40 from chickens) were obtained from deceased poultry and characterized to be Escherichia coli by gram staining, culture characterizing and bio-chemical testing. Two sets of primers were designed or analyzed with DNAStar software based on the F1 and HPI sequences that deposited in GenBank and synthesized by Sangon Biological Engineering Technology and Service Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, P. R. China). All the primers were tested for their specificities by using reference E. coli strains, and it is confirmed that the PCR using primers F1-F and F1-R could identify F1+ E. coli, as well as the PCR using primers irp-F and irp-R could identify HPI+ E. coli. All the isolates were submitted to PCR detection, and the data shows 46 isolates (66.7%) were F1-positive, 10 isolates (14.5%) were F1+ HPI-positive and 2 isolates (20.0%) were HPI-positive. Furthermore analysis indicated that the prevalence of F1 and HPI have no different between the isolates from geese and chickens, and no different among the isolates from different tissue, such as liver, lung and duodenum. In addition, all the 69 E. coli isolates serological typed, and the results show that the isolates from geese were belonged to O26 (25.0%), O78 (12.5%), O18 (12.5%) and O117 (12.5%), while E coli from chickens were fell into O109 (37.5%), O24 (18.75%), O18 (12.5%), O139 (12.5%) and O78 (6.25%). Seven kinds of antibiotics were tested on 11 isolates, and it revealed that most isolates were sensitive to cefazolin, nitrofurantoin and gentamycin, while resistant to lincomycin, tetracycline and polymycin B.

Organohalogen pollutants (OHPs) including chlorinated paraffins (CPs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and other halogenated flame retardants (OHFRs) (dechlorane plus (DP), decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE), 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy) ethane (BTBPE), hexabromobenzene (HBB), hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs) and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA)) originating from an e-waste recycling area in Guiyu, southern China were investigated in chicken and goose eggs. As expected, OHP concentrations were higher in chicken eggs collected from the location (site 1) approaching the e-waste recycling center than from the location (site 2) far from the e-waste recycling center. Also, much higher OHP levels were observed in goose eggs foraging in residential area (site 2) than that in agricultural area (site 1), suggesting a clear habitat dependent OHP bioaccumulation pattern both concerning distance from e-waste activities and type of foraging habitat. Goose eggs exhibited higher short chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) concentrations but lower PBDE and OHFR levels than chicken eggs. The proportion of high brominated PBDEs (hepta-to deca-BDEs) was lower in goose eggs than that in chicken eggs and showed a clear decrease from site 1 to site 2. DP isomeric composition fanti values (the ratio of the anti-DP to the sum of the anti- and syn-DP) in goose eggs were significantly lower than those in chicken eggs (p < 0.001). These differences are likely a reflection of factors such as the species-specific differences in habitat preference and the differing environmental behaviors of the pollutants owing to their inherent properties (such as solubility and vapor pressure). Our findings suggested a high dietary intake of OHPs via home-produced eggs. For BDE99 there is a potential health concern with respect to the current dietary exposure via eggs.

A high incidence of cartilaginous nodules was found in the lungs of broiler chickens. The incidence was higher in broilers fed ad libitum than in broilers fed a restricted amount of food. A much lower incidence of nodules was found in leghorn-type chickens, turkeys, ducks, and geese. It was theorized that the nodules may develop from embolic chondrocytes arising from abnormal cartilage, but no correlation could be found between lesions in the cartilage of the broilers and the presence of nodules in their lungs.

Compulsory surveillance programmes for avian influenza (AI) have been implemented in domestic poultry and wild birds in all the European Member States since 2005. The implementation of these programmes is complex and requires a close evaluation. A good indicator to assess their efficacy is the sensitivity (Se) of the surveillance system. In this study, the sensitivities for different sampling designs proposed by the Spanish authorities for the commercial poultry population of Catalonia were assessed, using the scenario tree model methodology. These samplings were stratified throughout the territory of Spain and took into account the species, the types of production and their specific risks. The probabilities of detecting infection at different prevalences at both individual and holding level were estimated. Furthermore, those subpopulations that contributed more to the Se of the system were identified. The model estimated that all the designs met the requirements of the European Commission. The probability of detecting AI circulating in Catalonian poultry did not change significantly when the within-holding design prevalence varied from 30% to 10%. In contrast, when the among-holding design prevalence decreased from 5% to 1%, the probability of detecting AI was drastically reduced. The sampling of duck and goose holdings, and to a lesser extent the sampling of turkey and game bird holdings, increased the Se substantially. The Se of passive surveillance in chickens for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) were also assessed. The probability of the infected birds manifesting apparent clinical signs and the awareness of veterinarians and farmers had great influence on the probability of detecting AI. In order to increase the probability of an early detection of HPAI in chicken, the probability of performing AI specific tests when AI is suspected would need to be increased.

The RNA transcription profile of the goose parvovirus (GPV) was determined, and it is a surprising hybrid of features of the Parvovirus and Dependovirus genera of the Parvovirinae subfamily of the Parvoviridae. Similar to the Dependovirus adeno-associated virus type 5, RNAs transcribed from the GPV upstream P9 promoter, which encode the viral nonstructural proteins, were polyadenylated at a high efficiency at a polyadenylation site [(pA)p] located within an intron in the center of the genome. Efficient usage of (pA)p required a downstream element that overlaps with the polypyrimidine tract of the A2 3' splice site of the central intron. An upstream element required for efficient use of (pA)p was also identified. RNAs transcribed from the P42 promoter, presumed to encode the viral capsid proteins, primarily extended through (pA)p and were polyadenylated at a site, (pA)d, located at the right end of the genome and ultimately spliced at a high efficiency. No promoter analogous to the Dependovirus P19 promoter was detected; however, similar to minute virus of mice and other members of the Parvovirus genus, a significant portion of pre-mRNAs generated from the P9 promoter were additionally spliced within the putative GPV Rep1 coding region and likely encode an additional, smaller, nonstructural protein. Also similar to members of the Parvovirus genus, detectable activity of the GPV P42 promoter was highly dependent on transactivation by the GPV Rep1 protein in a manner dependent on binding to a cis-element located in the P42 promoter.

Inapparent avian exposure was suspected for the sporadic infection of avian influenza A(H7N9) occurring in China. This type of exposure is usually unnoticed and difficult to model and measure. Infected poultry with avian influenza H7N9 virus typically remains asymptomatic, which may facilitate infection through inapparent poultry/bird exposure, especially in a country with widespread practice of backyard poultry. The present study proposed a novel approach that integrated ecological and case-control methods to quantify the risk of inapparent avian exposure on human H7N9 infection. Significant associations of the infection with chicken and goose densities, but not with duck density, were identified after adjusting for spatial clustering effects of the H7N9 cases across multiple geographic scales of neighborhood, community, district and city levels. These exposure risks varied geographically in association with proximity to rivers and lakes that were also proxies for inapparent exposure to avian-related environment. Males, elderly people, and farmers were high-risk subgroups for the virus infection. These findings enable health officials to target educational programs and awareness training in specific locations to reduce the risks of inapparent exposure.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus subtype H5N1 threatens poultry production and human health. Understanding the role that migratory waterfowl play in introducing and maintaining this infection is critical to control the outbreaks. A study was conducted to determine if the occurrence of HPAI subtype H5N1 outbreaks in village poultry in Romania, 2005-2006, was associated with proximity to populations of migratory waterfowl. Reported outbreaks--which could be grouped into three epidemic phases--and migratory waterfowl sites were mapped. The migratory waterfowl site closest to each outbreak was identified. The distances between outbreaks occurring in phase 1 and 2 of the epidemic and the closest migratory waterfowl site were significantly (P<0.001) less than in phase 3, but these distances were only useful in predicting when outbreaks occurred during phase 1 (October-December, 2005) of the epidemic. A spatial lag (rho=0.408, P=0.041) model best fit the data, using distance and [distance]*[distance] as predictors (R2=0.425). The correlation between when outbreaks were predicted to occur and when they were observed to occur was 0.55 (P=0.006). Results support the hypothesis that HPAI virus subtype H5N1 infections of village poultry in Romania during the autumn of 2005 might have occurred via exposure to migratory populations of waterfowl.

We have measured the partial pressure of O2 at 50% saturation (P50) and the concentration of various phosphate compounds in the erythrocytes of the bar-headed goose and the guanaco to establish the cause of the high blood O2 affinity in animals who normally reside at high altitude. The same data were obtained in the blood of two goose species, that live at sea level, and in human blood. At standard conditions (pH 7.4, PCO2 40 Torr, 37 degrees C), P50 was 29.7 Torr in the blood of the bar-headed goose and was about 10 Torr higher in the goose species living at sea level. Since the concentration of organic phosphates was not markedly different in the erythrocytes of either goose species we conclude that the hemoglobin of the bar-headed goose reacts more weakly with organic phosphates, which can also be inferred from studies on purified hemoglobin solutions. Likewise, the low P50 of guanaco blood in comparison with human blood can be explained by a reduced interaction of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate of guanaco hemoglobin compared to the human pigment.

Toxoplasma gondii isolates can be grouped into 3 genetic lineages. Type I isolates are considered virulent to outbred mice, whereas Type II and III isolates are not. In the present report, viable T. gondii was isolated for the first time from striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), Canada goose (Branta canadensis), and black-winged lory (Eos cyanogenia). For the isolation of T. gondii, tissues were bioassayed in mice, and genotyping was based on the SAG2 locus. Toxoplasma gondii was isolated from 3 of 6 skunks, 1 of 4 Canada geese, and 2 of 2 feral cats (Felis catus) from Mississippi. All donor animals were asymptomatic. Viable T. gondii was also isolated from 5 of 5 lories that had died of acute toxoplasmosis in an aviary in South Carolina. Genotypes of T. gondii isolates were Type III (all skunks, lories, and the goose) and Type II (both cats). All 5 Type III isolates from birds and 2 of the 3 isolates from skunks were mouse virulent.

Antibiotic and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have been considered as emerging environmental contaminants and possess potential crisis to global public health. However, little is known about the differences between various configurations of two-stage combinations of constructed wetlands (CWs) on antibiotics and ARG removal from wastewater. In the study, three configurations of two-stage hybrid CWs (horizontal subsurface flow-down-flow vertical subsurface flow CWs, HF-DVF; horizontal subsurface flow-up-flow vertical subsurface flow CWs, HF-UVF; down-flow vertical subsurface flow-up-flow vertical subsurface flow CWs, DVF-UVF) were operated to evaluate their ability to remove high-concentration antibiotics (tilmicosin-TMS and doxycycline-DOC), ARGs (seven tet genes and three erm genes), intI1, 16S rRNA, and nutrients from goose wastewater. The results showed that all three hybrid CWs could remove more than 98% of TMS and DOC from wastewater, without significant difference among treatments (p > 0.05). For ARGs, DVF-UVF showed significantly higher removal efficiencies of intI1, ermB, ermC, ermF, tetW, and tetG compared to HF-UVF (p < 0.05), mainly because they might remove and arrest growth of bacteria. The relatively high removal efficiencies of NH4+-N, NO3-N, and NO2--N were also observed from DVF-UVF, ranging from 87% to 95% (p > 0.05), indicating that anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) might be established in the CWs. Our results demonstrate that the removal performances of antibiotics using two-stage hybrid CWs are not affected by the combined configuration, whereas the combination of DVF and UVF CWs perform better on the removal of ARGs and nutrients compared with HF-DVF and HF-UVF CWs.

Although West Nile Virus (WNV) has not been reported in Hawai'i, eventual introduction appears unavoidable with potential adverse effects on avian species. Nēnē (Branta sandvicensis) are endemic endangered Hawaiian geese that are susceptible to WNV. We demonstrate that a vaccine developed against WNV for humans (WN-80E) is also highly immunogenic in Nēnē and does not produce adverse biologic effects. Six captive, nonbreeding Nēnē were immunized with two 10-μg doses (4 wk apart) of the WN-80E recombinant protein adjuvanted with Montanide ISA720. Two Nēnē were similarly injected with "mock" preparation as controls. Blood samples were collected before the first dose, then 2 wk and 6 mo after the second dose. WNV-specific antibody titers were determined by an endpoint enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. An unpaired t-test demonstrated significantly higher geometric mean titers for immunized vs. control groups 2 wk after dose 2 (4,129 and 100, respectively, P=0.010) and 6 mo after dose 2 (246 and 63, respectively, P=0.002). Daily observations revealed no swelling at the site of injection and no serious adverse biological effects from the immunization. The vaccine containing the WN-80E and Montanide ISA720 adjuvant appears to be safe and immunogenic in Nēnē. This protein-based WNV vaccine may be safer for use in Hawai'i than killed virus and live chimeric or recombinant canarypox-vectored vaccines because it cannot cause disease.

Five Cryptosporidium-free Canada geese (Branta canadensis) were individually orally dosed with 3.5 x 10(6) Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts infectious to neonatal BALB/c mice. After intestinal passage, inoculum-derived oocysts extracted from goose faeces established severe infection in 14 neonatal BALB/c mice (inoculum dose 2.5 x 10(5)/mouse). The inoculum-derived oocysts were detected in goose faeces up to 9 days post-inoculation (PI); the number of intact oocysts and oocyst shells shed during the first 3 days PI was significantly higher than for the remaining 6 days PI (P < 0.01). Based on acid-fast stained air-dried direct wet smears, 62% of the oocysts in goose faeces were intact (oocyst shells) constituted 38%) and conformed to morphological features of viable and infectious inoculum oocysts. The fluorescence scores of the inoculated oocysts, obtained by use of the MERIFLUOR test, were identical to those obtained for the faeces-recovered oocysts (majority 3+ to 4+). The dynamics of oocyst shedding showed that overall, the birds released a significantly higher number of intact oocysts than oocyst (P < 0.01). Retention of the viability and infectivity of C. parvum oocysts following intestinal passage through a migratory water-fowl species has serious epidemiological implications. Water-fowl can serve as mechanical vectors for the water-borne oocysts and can contaminate surface waters with C. parvum. As the concentration of Cryptosporidium oocysts in source waters is attributable to water-shed management practices, water-shed protection programme officials should consider water-fowl as a potential factor enhancing contamination of the source water with Cryptosporidium.

Goose parvovirus (GPV) usually affects goslings and Muscovy ducks but not Pekin ducks. Earlier works showed that a variant GPV can cause short beak and dwarfism syndrome (SBDS) in Pekin ducks. Here, we investigated the pathogenicity of a variant GPV of Pekin duck-origin (JS1) and a classical GPV of goose-origin (H) in Pekin ducklings. Following intramuscular infection at two days of age, both JS1 and H strains influenced weight gain and development of beaks and bones of wings and legs, and caused microscopic lesions of internal organs of ducks. However, the clinical signs typical of SBDS could only be replicated with the JS1 isolate. The findings suggest that both variant and classical GPVs are pathogenic for Pekin ducklings, while the former is more virulent than the latter. Using a quantitative real-time PCR assay, high levels of viral load were detected from bloods, internal organs, leg muscles, and ileac contents in JS1- and H-infected ducks from 6h to 35days postinfection (DPI). Using a GPV VP3-based ELISA, antibodies in sera of JS1- and H-infected ducks were detectable at 1 DPI and then persistently rose during the subsequent five weeks. These results suggest that both variant and classical GPVs can infect Pekin ducklings. The present work contributes to the understanding of pathogenicity of GPV to Pekin ducks and may provide clues to pathogenesis of GPV-related SBDS.

1. Individual variability in prey preferences can have marked effects on many demographic parameters from individual survival and fecundity to the vital rates of entire populations. A population level response is ultimately determined by individual prey choices; however, the effect of individual dietary choice is often overlooked. 2. We determined prey choice by individual consumers, light-bellied Brent geese Branta bernicla, during the overwintering period. Two hundred and eighty-one individuals were sampled at distinct temporal points over two winters. Stable isotopic ratios of carbon and nitrogen for blood cells and blood plasma, from each sampled individual were measured. Isotopic ratios for potential prey items were also measured. 3. Delta15N and delta13C for blood samples were both significantly different between sample months. Generally we found a decrease in both isotopic ratios during the course of the winter. All potential prey items were also isotopically distinct. Multisource mixing models (isosource) were used to determine the range of possible contribution to the diet of individuals. 4. During early winter, diet consisted almost exclusively of sea grass Zostera spp. The level of Zostera spp. in the diet dropped until mid-winter, and was supplemented by the utilization of green algae Ulva lactuca, and Enteromorpha spp., and terrestrial grasses. Terrestrial grass comprised an increasing proportion of the diet in late winter, representing virtually the exclusive food source by April. 5. By examining intrapopulation variability in resource utilization we highlight a number of ecologically important factors not addressed by previous population level studies.

Polysaccharide of Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz (PAMK) has been well recognized as an immune enhancer that can promote lymphocyte proliferation and activate immune cells. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of PAMK on humoral and cellular immune functions in immunosuppressed geese. Geese of the Control group were provided with normal feed, the PAMK group was provided with 400 mg·(kg body weight)−1 PAMK, the cyclophosphamide (CTX) group was injected with 40 mg·(kg body weight)−1 cyclophosphamide, while the CTX+PAMK group received the combination of PAMK and CTX. Spleen development and percentages of leukocytes in peripheral blood were examined. Principal component analysis was conducted to analyze correlations among humoral and cellular immune indicators. The results showed that PAMK alleviated the damage to the spleen, the decrease in T- and B-cell proliferation, the imbalance of leukocytes, and the disturbances of humoral and cellular immunity caused by CTX. Principal component analysis revealed that the relevance of humoral-immunity-related indicators was greater, and the CTX+PAMK group manifested the largest difference from the CTX group but was close to the Control group. In conclusion, PAMK alleviates the immunosuppression caused by CTX in geese, and the protective effect on humoral immunity is more obvious and stable.

Since 2016, the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N8 virus has emerged in the Central Asian flyway and Europe, causing massive deaths in poultry and wild birds. In this study, we isolated and identified three H5N8 viruses from swan goose and black swans in Hubei province during the 2016/2017 winter season. Whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the three viruses clustered into a group of H5N8 viruses from Qinghai Lake and Europe. A novel reassortment virus from swan goose was distinguished from that of black swans, in that its PA and NP genes were distinct from those of Qinghai Lake viruses. Molecular dating revealed that the ancestral strain of these H5N8 viruses emerged around July 2015. From sequence comparison, we discovered eight amino acid substitutions in HA and NA during the adaption process from poultry to wild birds. The three viruses were isolated from wild birds in the East Asian-Australasian flyway; however, the viral genomes were similar to H5N8 viruses circulating along the Central Asian flyway. From these data, we conclude that wetlands and lakes in Central China may play a key role in disseminating H5N8 viruses between the East Asian-Australasian and Central Asian flyways.

The present study compared the antioxidant system and lipid peroxidation in semen of two avian species: chicken and goose. The experiment was conducted on Greenleg Partridge roosters and White Koluda(®) ganders, each represented by 10 mature males. Malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were determined in sperm cells and seminal plasma. In gander spermatozoa, the amount of MDA was 10 times greater (P<0.01) than in rooster spermatozoa. Each of the investigated antioxidant enzymes had greater (P<0.01) activity in goose than chicken sperm. Catalase activity was detected in seminal plasma and spermatozoa from both studied species for the first time. In seminal plasma, the activity of GPx was two times greater (P<0.01) in the White Koluda(®) than in chickens, whereas SOD activity was less (P<0.01) than in chickens. This is the first study describing the presence of CAT in avian semen and the occurrence of indicator of lipid peroxidation (LPO) in geese. Data from the present study clearly show the species-specific differences in the activity of antioxidant defense and LPO. The greater amount of lipid peroxidation and greater activity of antioxidant enzymes in goose semen might suggest that spermatozoa were under greater oxidative stress and the enzymes were not utilized for the protection of functionally and structurally impaired cells. In turn, in fresh chicken semen a lesser activity of antioxidant enzymes accompanied with a lesser lipid peroxidation amount and good semen quality could indicate that fowl spermatozoa were under oxidative stress, but the enzymes were employed to protect and maintain sperm quality.

4,4'-Dinitrocarbanilide (DNC) was extracted from chicken, duck, and goose plasma and isolated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. DNC was detected by ultraviolet absorbance at 347 nm and quantified by comparison to a calibration standard. Recovery data were determined by analyzing DNC-fortified control plasma. The mean recovery of DNC in fortified chicken plasma samples was 99.7 +/- 1.9% for 0.18 and 9.1 ppm DNC, and in fortified duck and goose plasma samples was 99.5 +/- 4.9% and 101.4 +/- 4.5%, respectively, for 0.18, 9.1, and 18 ppm DNC.

We investigated the histological structure and histochemistry of the nasal conchae of geese and compared these structures with those of other avian species. The rostral, middle and caudal conchae were dissected from the nasal cavity of eight geese, fixed in Carnoy's solution and embedded in paraffin. The entrance of the rostral concha was lined by keratinized stratified squamous epithelium, which toward the middle concha was replaced by modified keratinized squamous epithelium, the deep layer of which opened into tubular glandular structures containing secretory epithelium on crypt-like invaginations. The lamina propria of the rostral concha contained numerous Grandry's and Herbst corpuscles, which are pressure-sensitive receptors peculiar to waterfowl. The lamina propria of the middle concha contained solitary lymphoid follicles and lymphocyte infiltrations. The cartilaginous component of the middle concha was highly convoluted and resembled a spiral of two and a half scrolls, which were lined by pseudostratified columnar epithelium. We observed that unlike mammals, this epithelium contained mostly intraepithelial alveolar glands rather than goblet cells. The caudal concha was similar to the middle concha, but less convoluted. It was lined by olfactory epithelium and its lamina propria contained serous Bowman's glands as well as olfactory nerve fibers. Histochemical examination demonstrated that while none of the conchae contained sulfated mucins, except for the cartilage, the intraepithelial glands of the rostral and middle conchae contained mostly carboxylated acidic mucin and some neutral mucin, and were thus of the mixed type. The outermost scroll of the spiral of the middle concha contained some periodate-Schiff stained mucins. Of the glands of the mucosa of the middle concha, the deep tubuloalveolar glands in the convex parts of the scrolls contained primarily acidic mucins, while the shallow intraepithelial alveolar glands in the concave parts of the scrolls contained primarily neutral mucins. Our findings indicate that the rostral and caudal conchae primarily have a sensory function and the middle concha participates in mucosal defense.

We investigated the effects of a turf application of the insecticide diazinon AG500 on Canada geese (Branta canadensis) on a golf course in coastal Washington (USA). On both 19 and 26 March 1987, 1 ha of turf on a golf course located in Birch Bay, Washington was treated with diazinon AG500 at a target application rate of 2.2 kg active ingredient per hectare (AI/ha). Treated areas were then irrigated with 6 mm water. Grass and water samples were collected from three different sites one day before and 1, 3, 7 and 14 days after each application. Diazinon residues > or = 20 ppm were found in golf course grasses for one week after each application. Diazinon residues in study area ponds and creeks were > or = 17 ppb. Samples from two irrigation puddles one day post-application had 1.00 and 0.20 ppm of diazinon, respectively. Numbers of geese present declined following diazinon application; however, no goose mortality was observed. Geese spent 422 and 538 min feeding on the treated areas after the first and second diazinon applications, respectively. One goose feeding in treated areas demonstrated signs of poisoning (lethargy, ataxia) for several hours. Two other geese feeding in the treated areas may have been slightly intoxicated. During carcass searches, three American wigeon (Anas americana) carcasses were found. Based on brain cholinesterase (ChE) levels and gastrointestinal (GI) tract residues of diazinon present, we concluded that these wigeon died from diazinon poisoning. Numerous songbirds (Passeriformes) also fed on the treated turf but no apparent response to the insecticide was observed.

Fatty liver in the goose results from an increased hepatic lipogenesis in response to overfeeding, together with a deficient secretion of triacylglycerol as very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). Orotic acid and estrogen, which both modify lipid metabolism in the liver, were used in male geese as tools to understand the alterations of liver lipids and plasma lipoproteins during the induction of liver steatosis. Liver lipids were analyzed after solvent extraction and plasma lipoproteins after separation by density gradient ultracentrifugation. Contrary to what is known in the rat, orotic acid (1% in food for 2 weeks) failed to induce liver steatosis. In force-fed geese, liver weight increased from approximately 100 g to approximately 800 g in 2 weeks, as a consequence of a specific accumulation of triacylglycerol. In both groups, VLDL contained less triacylglycerol (35%) than normal. Such an uncoupling of triacylglycerol synthesis and secretion, of which the precise reason is still unknown, may facilitate their accumulation when force-feeding increases hepatic lipogenesis. As with force-feeding, triacylglycerol synthesis was enhanced by estrogen, but their secretion as VLDL was very efficient and prevented liver steatosis almost completely. Since HDL concentrations were considerably decreased by estrogen, VLDL were the main lipoprotein species, with 48 g/l and 62% triacylglycerol. Where estrogen-treated geese were force-fed concomitantly, VLDL concentration was even higher (62 g/l), but triacylglycerol secretion could not prevent liver steatosis (liver weight 640 g). The data are discussed in relation to in vitro studies showing that channelling of triacylglycerol towards secretion as VLDL or hepatic storage depends on their residence time in the different intracellular compartments.

Campylobacter spp. are the most common cause of bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide and have been isolated from a wide number of different hosts and environmental sources. Waterfowl is considered a natural reservoir for this zoonotic bacterium and may act as a potential infection source for human campylobacteriosis. In this study, faecal samples from 924 barnacle geese were tested for the presence of C. jejuni and C. coli. The resulting C. jejuni and C. coli populations were characterized by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), structure analysis by BAPS and phylogenetic analysis based on full genome sequences. The prevalences of C. jejuni in barnacle geese faeces were 11.5% and 23.1% in 2011 and 2012, respectively, and only 0.2% of the samples were positive for C. coli in both years. Furthermore, a possible adaption of the clonal complexes (CCs) ST-702 and ST-1034 to the barnacle geese reservoir was found, as these two CCs represented the majority of the typed isolates and were repeatedly isolated from different flocks at several time-points. Further core genome phylogenetic analysis using ClonalFrame revealed a formation of a distinct monophyletic lineage by these two CCs, suggesting a certain degree of clonality of the C. jejuni population adapted to barnacle geese. Therefore, although STs also commonly found in humans patients (e.g. ST-45) were among the barnacle geese C. jejuni isolates, this reservoir is probably an infrequent source for human campylobacteriosis.

Double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) is an important antiviral IFN-stimulated gene (ISGs) that recognizes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and mediates inhibition of translation initiation and protein synthesis in various types of viral infection. In this study, the complete coding sequence (CDS) of goose PKR (goPKR) is identified and characterized. The open reading frame (ORF) of goPKR is 1668 bp, which encodes a polypeptide of 555 amino acids. The sequence identity results demonstrate that the goose PKR is most closely related to duck PKR gene, with nucleotide identities of 91.6%, whereas nucleotide identity of the goose PKR to chicken, human, and mouse PKR is 76.4%, 51.9%, and 52.0%, respectively. Interestingly, the deduced amino acid sequence of goose PKR contains 3 main structure domains, including 2 double-strand RNA-binding motif (dsRBM) domains and one serine/threonine protein kinase domain. This is similar to the chicken and mammals, whereas it is different from duck PKR protein, which contains only one dsRBM1 domain and one serine/threonine protein kinase domain. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicates that goose PKR mRNA is widely expressed in all sampled tissues. It is highly expressed in the blood, spleen, lung, and bursa of Fabricius and jejunum and is slightly expressed in heart, muscle, trachea, and brain. The results of confocal microscopy suggest that PKR-EGFP is mainly localized in the cytoplasm, and overexpression of goPKR protein significantly reduces Newcastle disease virus (NDV) replication (viral copies and viral titer) in goose embryo fibroblasts. These findings show that goose PKR is an important antiviral ISG, involved in the antiviral innate immune defense to NDV in geese.

Qinghai Lake in central China has been at the center of debate on whether wild birds play a role in circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1. In 2005, an unprecedented epizootic at Qinghai Lake killed more than 6000 migratory birds including over 3000 bar-headed geese (Anser indicus). H5N1 subsequently spread to Europe and Africa, and in following years has re-emerged in wild birds along the Central Asia flyway several times.

A comprehensive understanding of common diseases of backyard poultry flocks is important to providing poultry health information to flock owners, veterinarians, and animal health officials. We collected autopsy reports over a 3-y period (2015-2017) from diagnostic laboratories in 8 states in the United States; 2,509 reports were collected, involving autopsies of 2,687 birds. The primary cause of mortality was categorized as infectious, noninfectious, neoplasia or lymphoproliferative disease, or undetermined. Neoplasia or lymphoproliferative disease was the most common primary diagnosis and involved 42% of the total birds autopsied; 63% of these cases were diagnosed as Marek's disease or leukosis/sarcoma. Bacterial, parasitic, and viral organisms were commonly detected, involving 42%, 28%, and 7% of the birds autopsied, respectively, with 2 or more organisms detected in 69% of birds. Our findings demonstrate the importance of educating flock owners about disease prevention and biosecurity practices. The detection of zoonotic bacteria including paratyphoid salmonellae, Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, and Mycobacterium avium, and the detection of lead and other heavy metals, indicate public health risks to flock owners and consumers of backyard flock egg and meat products.

In the current study, we describe the pathobiologic characteristics of a novel reassortant virus - A/chicken/BC/FAV-002/2015 (H5N1) belonging to clade 2.3.4.4 that was isolated from backyard chickens in British Columbia, Canada. Sequence analyses demonstrate PB1, PA, NA and NS gene segments were of North American lineage while PB2, HA, NP and M were derived from a Eurasian lineage H5N8 virus. This novel virus had a 19 amino acid deletion in the neuraminidase stalk. We evaluated the pathogenic potential of this isolate in various animal models. The virus was highly pathogenic to mice with a LD50 of 10 plaque forming units (PFU), but had limited tissue tropism. It caused only subclinical infection in pigs which did result in seroconversion. This virus was highly pathogenic to chickens, turkeys, juvenile Muscovy ducks (Cairnia moschata foma domestica) and adult Chinese geese (Anser cynoides domesticus) causing a systemic infection in all species. The virus was also efficiently transmitted and resulted in mortality in naïve contact ducks, geese and chickens. Our findings indicate that this novel H5N1 virus has a wide host range and enhanced surveillance of migratory waterfowl may be necessary in order to determine its potential to establish itself in the wild bird reservoir.

Escherichia coli is currently used as an indicator of fecal pollution and to assess water quality. While several genotypic techniques have been used to determine potential sources of fecal bacteria impacting waterways and beaches, they do not allow for the rapid analysis of a large number of samples in a relatively short period of time. Here we report that gene probes identified by Hamilton and colleagues (M. J. Hamilton, T. Yan, and M. J. Sadowsky, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 72:4012-4019, 2006) were useful for the development of a high-throughput and quantitative macroarray hybridization system to determine numbers of E. coli bacteria originating from geese/ducks. The procedure we developed, using a QBot robot for picking and arraying of colonies, allowed us to simultaneously analyze up to 20,736 E. coli colonies from water samples, with minimal time and human input. Statistically significant results were obtained by analyzing 700 E. coli colonies per water sample, allowing for the analysis of approximately 30 sites per macroarray. Macroarray hybridization studies done on E. coli collected from water samples obtained from two urban Minnesota lakes and one rural South Carolina lake indicated that geese/ducks contributed up to 51% of the fecal bacteria in the urban lake water samples, and the level was below the detection limit in the rural lake water sample. This technique, coupled with the use of other host source-specific gene probes, holds great promise as a new quantitative microbial source tracking tool to rapidly determine the origins of E. coli in waterways and on beaches.

Due to the ability of birds to travel long distances in the air, the potential feeding area of each individual is much larger than that of typical terrestrial animals. This makes birds a convenient indicator of environmental lead (Pb) pollution over large areas, in particular areas of inland and coastal waters. The aim of this study was to assess the concentrations of Pb in various organs of water birds from a variety of locations. The focus was on ducks, geese and swans (Anatidae); herons and egrets (Ardeidae); terns (Sternidae); and gulls (Laridae). This article describes the level of lead in the most commonly studied tissue types: feathers, bones and the liver. The study also presents data concerning the concentration of lead in the eggs of water birds. The highest levels of lead pollution can be observed in China and Korea, related to their high level of industrialization. In Iran too, environmental lead pollution is high, likely due to the developed petrochemical industry. Lead pollution in Japan, as well as in Western European countries (Spain, France, Italy), seems to be much lower than in China, India or Iran. Nevertheless, the level of pollution in Europe is higher than satisfactory, despite the introduction of a number of bans related to, for example, the use of leaded petrol or lead-containing paints. Finally, the USA and Canada appear to be the areas with the lowest lead pollution, possibly due to their low population densities.

Six cases of fowl cholera in growing turkeys and 3 in adult breeder chickens of the broiler type as well as one case each of a Pasteurella (P.) multocida-associated disease in ducklings and goslings were described in consideration of own laboratory findings and available informations of the case history. Furthermore a report is given on a treatment strategy successfully used in turkeys with highly acute fowl cholera. All the P. multocida strains isolated culturally could be assigned to the subspecies multocida. In one case Bordetella avium, Salmonella (S.) arizonae and S. hadar were additionally cultured form part of turkeys submitted. P. multocida and Moraxella (Pasteurella) anatipestifer could be determined as the causative agents of the disease of ducklings and goslings. P. multocida strains from turkeys were identified serologically as serovars A:3.4 (3x), F:3.4 (2x) and A:3 (1x); those from the breeder chickens as A:3 (3x); and one each from ducklings and goslings as F:3.4 and -:3. (uncapsulated). No death occurred in turkeys with clinical signs of a highly acute fowl cholera if the treatment of the affected birds was started with an intravenous injection of sulfadimethoxine and continued with a combination of sulfachlorpyridazine (SCP) and trimethoprim (TMP) given in the drinking water for 5 days. However relapse occurred 2-3 days after withdrawal of the drug, although the therapy was clinically highly effective. The recurrence of the disease could be prevented reliably if the turkeys were vaccinated with an effective oil-based bacterin and subsequently treated with the SCP-TMP combination given in drinking water over a 12 day period.

There is so far no report describing the pathogenicity of goose circovirus (GoCV) following experimental infection. We report here an experimental inoculation of 21-day-old geese with a GoCV polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive sample of bursa of Fabricius (BF) homogenate, and the results of clinicopathological changes. Forty geese were randomly assigned to two groups: the inoculated group (n=30) receiving tissue homogenate and the uninoculated group (n=10) receiving a placebo (physiological saline). Tissue samples were collected for histopathological examination and GoCV detection. The main clinical signs in the GoCV-inoculated geese included diarrhoea at 17 to 30 days post inoculation, marked differences of growth rate and feather disorders in three of the geese. Viraemia was detected by PCR only at 14 days post inoculation. The BF, thymus, spleen, duodenum and liver of some inoculated geese were also PCR-positive. Real-time PCR showed that there was relatively more viral load in the BF. Histological examination revealed lymphocytic depletion and histiocytosis in the BF and inflammation characterized by lymphatic infiltration in the lung, liver and kidney. Immunohistochemistry applied to PCR-positive samples showed that in only three BF samples was GoCV antigen detected in lymphocytes in both the cortex and medulla. In situ apoptosis detection of all BF samples indicated that GoCV inoculation was associated with an increase in bursal lymphocytic apoptotic events.

A double-stranded cDNA library was constructed using total poly(A)+ RNA from the goose uropygial gland. Clones containing sequences complementary to fatty acid synthase mRNA were initially identified by colony hybridization with a 32P-labeled cDNA transcribed from RNA enriched for fatty acid synthase mRNA. Identity of the fatty acid synthase clones was confirmed by hybrid-selected translation. Mature fatty acid synthase mRNA is approximately 16 kilobases in length. When unfed neonatal goslings were fed for 24 hr, relative synthesis of hepatic fatty acid synthase increased more than 42-fold. Concomitantly, hepatic fatty acid synthase mRNA levels increased 70-fold. Thus, nutritional regulation of the synthesis of hepatic fatty acid synthase probably occurs at the pretranslational level. The availability of a specific probe for fatty acid synthase mRNA should allow us to analyze the regulation of expression of this gene during development, by nutrition and by hormones in both liver and uropygial gland.

Fetuin derivatives with enzymatically altered oligosaccharide units were tested for their ability to inhibit pertussis toxin-mediated agglutination of goose erythrocytes and the binding of 125I-labeled fetuin to pertussis toxin-coated polystyrene tubes. Fetuin oligosaccharides were sequentially degraded by treatment with: neuraminidase (asialofetuin) followed by beta-galactosidase (asialoagalactofetuin) and, lastly, with beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase (asialoagalacto-a[N-acetylglucosamino]fetuin). Asialofetuin retained only 19 and 53% of the inhibitory activity of native fetuin in the hemagglutination and 125I-fetuin binding assays, respectively. Asialoagalactofetuin showed no further reduction of inhibition in the hemagglutination system and, instead, resulted in partial recovery of inhibition in the 125I-fetuin-pertussis toxin binding assay. Asialoagalacto-a[N-acetylhexosamino]fetuin showed a further decrease in ability to inhibit pertussis toxin binding in both assays. The inhibitory activity of asialoagalactofetuin could be restored to that of native fetuin by adding back D-galactose with UDP-Gal:D-glucosyl-1,4-beta-galactosyltransferase, followed by the addition of terminal sialic acid residues with CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid:beta-D-galactosyl-1,4-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine-alpha-2,6-N- acetylneuraminyltransferase. The data suggested that a requirement for pertussis toxin binding to fetuin may be the presence of acetamido-containing sugar groups in the nonreducing terminal position of fetuin's oligosaccharides.

An outbreak of egg drop disease occurred in many chicken and goose farms in China in 2011. By using an NS5-specific reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), we found that 56% of chicken and 38% of goose samples were positive for Tembusu-like virus (TMUV). Isolates showed high sequence homology to duck TMUVs, and chickens and geese showed signs of egg drop disease after experimental infection with duck TMUV. Our data suggest TMUV has adapted in domestic birds.

Bar-headed goose fluoromethaemoglobin (fluoromet-Hb) complexed with inositol hexaphosphate (IHP) has been crystallized using PEG 6000 as precipitant. The crystal belongs to space group P2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 59.8, b = 72.0, c = 79.8 A, beta = 102.1 degrees, and diffracts to 2.5 A resolution. To prove the presence of IHP, the structure was determined by the molecular-replacement method. IHP was observed at the entrance to the central cavity between the N and C termini of two beta subunits.

The reverse indirect haemagglutination (RIHA) test has been standardized for the assay of the viral antigen of purified Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine. Glutaraldehyde fixed sheep erythrocytes were sensitized with ammonium sulphate purified antibodies to JE vaccine raised in mice. The sensitivity of the erythrocytes fell to about one hundredth of the initial sensitivity in the first two days after preparation. After initial loss in sensitivity the stability of the cells became stabilized and the cells retained their titre for one year at 4-8 degrees C. The initial loss in sensitivity was not reduced by storing the cells at -70 degrees C, but after freeze drying the sensitized cells with a stabilizer one day after their preparation the cells retained their sensitivity. The RIHA test has been found to be a highly reproducible and sensitive method for detecting viral antigen in 5-10 ng of protein nitrogen. The sensitivity of the test was affected by the origins of the erythrocytes, i.e. from the different sheep from which they were drawn. To obtain results more rapidly, goose erythrocytes were used in place of sheep erythrocytes and the sensitized goose erythrocytes gave RIHA results in only 40 min.

The hypothalamus plays a central role in controlling poultry endocrine and reproductive activities. So far there is limited information focused on the proteome profiles of the hypothalamus from geese during different stages of the egg-laying cycle. In order to identify proteins regulating the egg-laying process of Huoyan geese, we investigated the proteome profiles of the hypothalamus from Huoyan geese during the laying period and pre-laying period by applying an isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based proteomic technology. A total number of 3,337 were identified and quantified, of which 18 were significantly up-regulated and 16 were significantly down-regulated. These differentially expressed proteins were subjected to bioinformatics analyses based on the Gene Ontology annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway. Some of these were revealed to be involved in hormone and neurotransmitter secretion, exocytosis, calcium ion transport and synaptic transmission. Subsequently, excitatory amino acid transporter 2, complexin-1 and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, type 3 were confirmed at the messenger RNA level using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Then, the abundance change of these proteins was verified further using Western blotting analysis. These data may aid in elucidating the molecular mechanism of higher laying performance in Huoyan geese.

The role of sialic acid in the receptors for vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was investigated by treating chick embryo related (CER) cells and goose erythrocytes with neuraminidases from different sources and studying the effects produced on both infection and haemagglutination. The virus attachment to CER cells was reduced by their treatment with C. perfringens and A. ureafaciens neuraminidases and the susceptibility to viral infection of desialylated CER cells was recovered by coating with gangliosides immediately after enzymatic treatment. By contrast, enzymatic treatment of goose erythrocytes enhanced their agglutinability by VSV. The experiments carried out to test the ability of sialoglycolipids (gangliosides) and asialoglycolipids (cerebrosides) to inhibit virus attachment to CER cells or to goose erythrocytes showed that only gangliosides were able to inhibit VSV infection and haemagglutination.

Rabbit antisera directed against an onco-developmental antigen on chicken red blood cells have been serologically dissected through specific adsorptions. It is now possible to detect 13 antigenic determinants with the fractionated antisera. The onco-developmental antigen referred to as chicken fetal-leukemic antigen (CFA) is fetal-specific in the white Leghorn chicken, being present on the embryonic but not adult peripheral red blood cells of non-being present on the embryonic but not adult peripheral red blood cells of non-leukemic birds. However, one or more of the onco-developmental antigenic determinants have been detected on adult peripheral red blood cells of non-Gallus avian species, as well as on red blood cells from two adult chicken varieties. For phylogenetic purposes, red blood cells from avian species were characterized for their combinations of CFA determinants. Comparisons among species revealed specific patterns of antigenic expression within phylogenetic groups. Several CFA determinants were restricted in their occurrence to species within a single family, and one determinant was found in all cases where CFA was expressed. The distribution of CFA determinants was used to determine immunological distances among four Galliform species. These distances agreed with the immunological relationships established using different serological markers.

The detection of adulteration and mislabeling of food products, including intensively processed meat, is a challenge which needs urgent solutions to protect consumers' rights. The aim of the study was to demonstrate the feasibility of species-specific peptide-based LC-MS methods for monitoring duck, goose and chicken in processed meat products. Food commodities of various compositions, subjected to various treatments, including homogenization, cooking, roasting, drying, and sterilization during production, were examined to ensure that MS-based methods are resistant to matrix composition changes. A qualitative LC-QQQ multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method was developed which allows high-confidence monitoring of duck, goose and chicken meat (ten specific peptides), simultaneously with beef and pork (seven peptides), in the presence of turkey meat, in highly processed food. The developed LC-MS methods can be used for food authentication, monitoring of the food composition conformity with label statements and detection of adulteration of poultry-containing food products.

Haemorrhagic nephritis enteritis of the goose (HNEG) is an epizootic viral disease in domestic geese. The causal agent is a polyomavirus, namely goose haemorrhagic polyomavirus. To help control the disease, an inactivated vaccine was developed, based on viral particles produced in goose kidney cells. Viral material was quantified using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, inactivated with beta-propiolactone and adjuvanted with Carbopol, an acrylic acid polymer. Carbopol proved to be more immunogenic than aluminium hydroxide and was totally safe when administered to young goslings and breeders alike. Carbopol-adjuvanted vaccine induced a high serological response. Moreover, goslings hatched from vaccinated breeders were protected against viral challenge, indicating that maternally-derived neutralizing antibodies (MDA) were efficiently transferred. MDA were still detectable 15 days post-hatch. Clinical trials will be necessary to accurately evaluate a vaccine-based HNEG control strategy under field conditions.

From May through October 2016, we conducted a repeated cross-sectional study examining the effects of temporal, spatial, flock and demographic factors (i.e. juvenile vs. adult) on the prevalence of Campylobacter and antimicrobial resistant Enterobacteriaceae among 344 fresh faecal samples collected from Canada geese (Branta canadensis) from four locations where birds nested in Guelph, Ontario, Canada. The overall prevalence of Campylobacter among all fresh faecal samples was 9.3% and was greatest in the fall when these birds became more mobile following the nesting season. Based on 40 gene comparative genomic fingerprinting (CGF40), the increase in prevalence noted in the fall was matched by an increase in the number of unique CGF40 subtypes identified. Resistance to colistin was detected most commonly, in 6% of Escherichia coli isolates, and was highest in the late summer months. All colistin-resistant isolates were negative for the mcr-1 to mcr-5 genes; a chromosomal resistance mechanism (PmrB) was identified in all of these isolates. The prevalence of samples with E. coli exhibiting multi-class resistance or extended spectrum beta-lactamase was low (i.e. <2% of samples). The intra-class correlation coefficients, estimated from the variance components of multilevel logistic regression models, indicated that the shedding of Campylobacter and antimicrobial resistant E. coli among geese within a flock (i.e. birds collected from the same site on the same day) was moderately correlated. Spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal clusters identified using the spatial scan statistic, largely supported the findings from our multi-level models. Salmonella was not isolated from any of the fresh faecal samples collected suggesting that its prevalence in this population of birds was very low.

Circoviruses are circular single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses that infect a variety of animals, both domestic and wild. Circovirus infection in birds is associated with immunosuppression and this in turn predisposes the infected animals to secondary infections that can lead to mortality. Farmed geese (Anser anser) in many parts of the world are infected with circoviruses. The majority of the current genomic information for goose circoviruses (GoCVs) (n = 40) are from birds sampled in China and Taiwan, and only two genome sequences are available from Europe (Germany and Poland). In this study, we sampled 23 wild and 19 domestic geese from the Gopło Lake area in Poland. We determined the genomes of GoCV from 21 geese; 14 domestic Greylag geese (Anser anser), three wild Greylag geese (A. anser), three bean geese (A. fabalis), and one white fronted goose (A. albifrons). These genomes share 83-95% nucleotide pairwise identities with previously identified GoCV genomes, most are recombinants with exchanged fragment sizes up to 50% of the genome. Higher diversity levels can be seen within the genomes from domestic geese compared with those from wild geese. In the GoCV capsid protein (cp) and replication associated protein (rep) gene sequences we found that episodic positive selection appears to largely mirror those of beak and feather disease virus and pigeon circovirus. Analysis of the secondary structure of the ssDNA genome revealed a conserved stem-loop structure with the G-C rich stem having a high degree of negative selection on these nucleotides.

Since April 2010, a novel contagious disease in ducks and geese, with egg drop, feed uptake decline and neurological signs, caused by a newly emerged virus has spread around Eastern China. Dissection conducted on the dead geese demonstrated hemorrhage in brain, lung, liver, heart, ovary, and enlarged and necrotic spleen. A new virus, named Goose/Jiangsu/804/2010 (JS804) virus, was isolated in Jiangsu area from geese. Then the virus was re-isolated from the affected geese and replicated well in duck embryo fibroblasts and Vero cells, causing the cytopathic effect. The virus was identified as an enveloped positive stranded RNA virus with a size of approximately 40-60 nm in diameter. The full-length genome of this isolated virus was determined, showing that it is closely related to Tembusu virus (a mosquito-borne Ntaya group flavivirus) than other members of the Flaviviridae based on the data of phylogenetic analyses. Our systematic studies fulfill Koch's postulates precisely, and therefore, the causative agent of geese occurring in Eastern China is a new flavivirus. This is the first report that flavivirus infects not only egg-laying and breeder ducks but also geese. The findings extend our understanding of how the virus spreads and causes disease.

Goose haemorrhagic polyomavirus (GHPV) is an aetiological agent of haemorrhagic nephritis and enteritis of geese occurring in geese (Anser anser). GHPV may also infect Muscovy ducks (Carina mochata) and mule ducks. Early detection of GHPV is important to isolate the infected birds from the rest of the flock thus limiting infection transmission. The current diagnosis of haemorrhagic nephritis and enteritis of geese is based on virus isolation, histopathological examination, haemagglutination inhibition assay, ELISA and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Recently, real-time PCR assay was developed which considerably improved detection of GHPV. In spite of many advantages, these methods are still time-consuming and inaccessible for laboratories with limited access to ELISA plate readers or PCR thermocyclers. The aim of our study was to develop loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) that may be conducted in a water bath. Two pairs of specific primers complementary to VP1 gene of GHPV were designed. The results of GHPV LAMP were recorded under ultraviolet light. Our study showed LAMP was able to specifically amplify VP1 fragment of a GHPV without cross-reactivity with other pathogens of geese and ducks. LAMP detected as little as 1.5 pg of DNA extracted from a GHPV standard strain (150 pg/µl). The optimized LAMP was used to examine 18 field specimens collected from dead and clinically diseased geese and ducks aged from 1 to 12 weeks. The positive signal for GHPV was detected in three out of 18 (16.6%) specimens. These results were reproducible and consistent with those of four real-time PCR. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report on LAMP application for the GHPV detection.

Currently available bacterial source-tracking tools are often technically demanding, time consuming, and have limited accuracy in grouping isolates according to their respective sources. There is a need for the development of bacterial source-tracking tools that would allow for more rapid and accurate grouping of isolates by source. We examined the use of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) for the characterization of environmental isolates of Enterococcus. Our main objectives were to develop sample preparation protocols for obtaining reproducible MALDI-TOF mass spectra from Enterococcus isolates and to evaluate methods of data analysis to maximize repeatability of the method and its ability to group isolates according to their respective sources. Our data showed that treatment of 21 Enterococcus isolates from seven unique sources with lysozyme for 20 h, followed by calculation of similarity coefficients using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, facilitated a repeatability level of 91% as well as grouping by source for isolates obtained from several sources including human waste. Our data suggest that MALDI-TOF-MS-based fingerprinting of environmental isolates of Enterococcus has potential as a rapid and accurate bacterial source tracking (BST) tool, but requires further development, specifically regarding the time requirements needed for pre-treatment of isolates with lysozyme.

The melanocortin-5 receptor (MC5R) is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily that plays a critical role in lipid production, skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation, and adipocyte lipolysis. Although multiple functions and important value of MC5R in human beings have been fully demonstrated, however, the potential molecular cloning, pharmacological characteristics and key amino acids in poultry and pig were still not fully understood. Herein, we successfully cloned MC5R genes from chicken (Gallus gallus, cMC5R), duck (Anas platyrhynchos, dMC5R), goose (Anser cygnoides domesticus, gMC5R) and pig (Sus scrofa domestica, pMC5R), and compared their genetic and protein difference with hMC5R through phylogenetic analysis and homology models. Besides, we constructed three alanine-substitution mutants for each of MC5Rs through homologous reorganization, including c/d/gMC5R-D119A/F254A/H257A and pMC5R-D204A/F339A/H342A. Subsequently, we focused our investigation on the pharmacological characterization of four wide-type MC5Rs and their mutants in HEK293T cells, including the intracellular cAMP generation and phosphorylation level of ERK1/2. The results showed that these mutants had decreased cAMP levels under the stimulation of ligands, in spite of enhanced basal activity for c/d/gF254A and pH342A, indicating their important roles in the location and activation of receptors. Notably, these MC5Rs and mutants displayed significant species-specific phenotypes in the activation of pERK1/2 with ligands, which was not completely consistent with hMC5R. These findings demonstrated that presence of interspecies differences for MC5Rs, particularly for the pERK1/2 pathway. Taken together, our study expands current knowledge about the molecular and pharmacological characterization of c/d/g/pMC5Rs, providing preliminary data for MC5R-targeted drug screening or genetic breeding of economic animals in the future.

Primers based on the cDNA sequence of the goose growth hormone (GH) gene in GenBank were designed to amplify exon 2 of the GH gene in Huoyan goose. A total of 552 individuals were brooded in one batch and raised in Liaoning and Jiangsu Provinces, China. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of exon 2 in the GH gene were detected by the polymerase chain reaction (single strand conformation polymorphism method). Homozygotes were subsequently cloned, sequenced and analyzed. Two SNP mutations were detected, and 10 genotypes (referred to as AA, BB, CC, DD, AB, AC, AD, BC, BD and CD) were obtained. Allele D was predominant, and the frequencies of the 10 genotypes fit the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the male, female and whole populations according to the chi-square test. Based on SNP types, the 10 genotypes were combined into three main genotypes. Multiple comparisons were carried out between different genotypes and production traits when the geese were 10 weeks old. Some indices of production performance were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with the genotype. Particularly, geese with genotype AB or BB were highly productive. Thus, these genotypes may serve as selection markers for production traits in Huoyan geese.

The Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918-1919 was a cataclysmic outbreak of infection wherein over 50 million people died worldwide within 18 months. The question of the origin is important because most influenza surveillance at present is focussed on S.E. Asia. Two later pandemic viruses in 1957 and 1968 arose in this region. However we present evidence that early outbreaks of a new disease with rapid onset and spreadability, high mortality in young soldiers in the British base camp at Etaples in Northern France in the winter of 1917 is, at least to date, the most likely focus of origin of the pandemic. Pathologists working at Etaples and Aldershot barracks later agreed that these early outbreaks in army camps were the same disease as the infection wave of influenza in 1918. The Etaples camp had the necessary mixture of factors for emergence of pandemic influenza including overcrowding (with 100,000 soldiers daily changing), live pigs, and nearby live geese, duck and chicken markets, horses and an additional factor 24 gases (some of them mutagenic) used in large 100 ton quantities to contaminate soldiers and the landscape. The final trigger for the ensuing pandemic was the return of millions of soldiers to their homelands around the entire world in the autumn of 1918.

Fatal disseminated Toxoplasma gondii infection was diagnosed in 2 captive magpie geese (Anseranas semipalmata) from a zoo in Texas. Both geese died suddenly, without apparent clinical signs. Lesions associated with T. gondii tachyzoites were seen in lungs, pancreas, liver, adrenals, bursa of Fabricius, spleen, brain, and kidneys. Toxoplasmic pneumonia and hepatitis were considered to be the primary cause of death. An unusual feature was the presence of numerous tissue cysts in hepatocytes of both geese. The diagnosis was confirmed immunohistochemically. Antibodies to T. gondii were found in 2 of 11 other geese from the zoo examined using the modified agglutination test. This is the first report of T. gondii infection in magpie geese (Anseranas semipalmata).

We enumerated parasite burdens within the blood, gizzard, ceca, and kidneys of adult female lesser snow geese Chen caerulescens caerulescens collected from the breeding colony at La Pérouse Bay, Manitoba, Canada, in 1989. We observed 5 species of nematodes, 1 species of digenean, 1 species of protozoan, and an unidentified microfilaria in these geese. We compared parasite burdens between geese collected during the incubation (2-14 June) and brood-rearing (1-5 August) periods. There was a significant decrease in the prevalence and intensity of the gizzard nematode Amidostomum spatulatum and a significant increase in the prevalence of the renal coccidium Eimeria truncata between the 2 collection periods. We suggest that the changes concerning A. spatulatum reflect transmission conditions some 6 months earlier when the geese were on the wintering grounds. Changes involving E. truncata reflected transmission conditions within the previous month. Consequently, it would appear that breeding colonies are the foci for transmission of E. truncata, a significant pathogen of adults and goslings.

Methodologies are described for the production and characterization of monoclonal antibodies to human haemoglobin. Three monoclonal antibodies are described, two of which recognize distinct determinants on the alpha-chain subunit. A third monoclonal antibody, Hb-2d, recognizes a determinant expressed on human beta-chain. The Hb-2d determinant is shared by human and baboon haemoglobins, but is not expressed by haemoglobins from beef, goose, pig, rabbit, sheep, dog, rat or mouse. Monoclonal antibody Hb-2d will bind to haemoglobin A2 but not to foetal haemoglobin suggesting that delta-but not gamma-chain also expresses the Hb-2d determinant. The results of testing a limited panel of human haemoglobin variants is presented.

Combination of CVCVA5 adjuvant and commercial avian influenza (AI) vaccine has been previously demonstrated to provide good protection against different AI viruses in chickens. In this study, we further investigated the protective immunity of CVCVA5-adjuvanted oil-emulsion inactivated AI vaccine in chickens, ducks and geese. Compared to the commercial H5 inactivated vaccine, the H5-CVCVA5 vaccine induced significantly higher titers of hemaglutinin inhibitory antibodies in three lines of broiler chickens and ducks, elongated the antibody persistence periods in geese, elevated the levels of cross serum neutralization antibody against different clade and subclade H5 AI viruses in chicken embryos. High levels of mucosal antibody were detected in chickens injected with the H5 or H9-CVCA5 vaccine. Furthermore, cellular immune response was markedly improved in terms of increasing the serum levels of cytokine interferon-γ and interleukine 4, promoting proliferation of splenocytes and upregulating cytotoxicity activity in both H5- and H9-CVCVA5 vaccinated chickens. Together, these results provide evidence that AI vaccines supplemented with CVCVA5 adjuvant is a promising approach for overcoming the limitation of vaccine strain specificity of protection.

To establish an ideal method for the detailed definition of the tropism of the goose adenovirus new-type gosling viral enteritis virus (NGVEV) in conventional paraformaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded gosling tissue sections, an indirect immunofluorescence assay was established and optimized in this study for the first time. Three-day-old goslings orally inoculated with the CN strain of NGVEV were killed from 0.5 h to 30 days post-infection (p.i.) at intervals, and organs were collected and prepared for immunofluorescence assay and ultrastructural observation. NGVEV antigens could be detected in the gastrointestinal tract and lymphoid organs as early as 24 h p.i. The lymphoid organs (bursa of Fabricius, thymus, Harderian gland and spleen), the digestive organs (proventriculus, gizzard, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum, rectum and liver), kidney, myocardium and brain of NGVEV-infected goslings showed extensive evidence of presence of viral antigens. Lymphocytes, macrophages, mesenchymes, endothelial cells, epithelia, superficial and crypt mucosal cells, glandular cells, and fibrocytes served as the principal site for NGVEV localization. The number of positive cells and intensity of fluorescence increased until 15 days p.i. Ultrastructural observation showed that NGVEV particles could be seen from 3 days p.i. onwards.

This study investigated patterns of Escherichia coli in urban lakes in Lubbock, Texas. Specific objectives were to (1) document seasonal patterns in abundance of E. coli over a 3-year period, (2) identify environmental factors, including effects of migratory geese and artificial aeration devices that may influence E. coli abundance, and (3) determine if E. coli abundance over time was similar for individual lakes. Water samples were collected monthly for 36 months from six lakes, three of which contained artificial aeration devices (fountains). Regression models were constructed to determine which environmental variables most influence E. coli abundance in summer and winter seasons. Escherichia coli is present in the lakes of Lubbock, Texas year-round and typically exceeds established bacterial thresholds for recreational waters. Models most frequently contained pH and dissolved oxygen as predictor variables and explained from 17.4% to 92.4% of total variation in E. coli. Lakes with fountains had a higher oxygen concentration during summer and contained consistently less E. coli. We conclude that solar irradiation in synergy with pH and dissolved oxygen is the primary control mechanism for E. coli in study lakes, and that fountains help control abundance of fecal bacteria within these systems.

This study investigated the regulatory mechanisms of seasonal breeding, developments of ovarian follicles and incubation in Magang geese, a short day breeding bird. Throughout the year, plasma PRL concentrations increased in non-breeding season in spring and summer (from April to early August), and remained low in the rest of the year, while LH concentrations peaked in August and September and remained low in non-breeding season (March to June). Lengthening photoperiod increased PRL and decreased LH secretions, which inhibited follicular development, terminated lay and induced moulting, while shortening photoperiod decreased PRL and increased LH secretion and reinitiated lay. Long photoperiod stimulated PRL secretion occurred with increased gene expressions of PRL in the pituitary gland and VIP in the hypothalamus, but inhibition of LH secretion was without decreases in gene expressions of LH beta subunit and GnRH. Under breeding conditions, terminating incubation decreased PRL but increased LH concentrations and resumed lay in 24 days following recruitment of about 10 large white follicles into hierarchical development. Plasma concentrations of progesterone and inhibin peaked at peak lay, whereas LH concentrations exhibited a bi-phasic pattern with troughs at peak lay and incubation when PRL concentrations were high. Ninety percent geese exhibited incubation behaviour after laying one clutch of approximately eight eggs in approximately 30 days. In conclusion the seasonal reproductive activities in Magang geese is directly inhibited by long photoperiod and directly stimulated by short photoperiod via PRL and LH secretions, whose interplays also cause occurrences of four to five lay and incubation cycles in the breeding season.

Capture-recapture models were originally developed to account for encounter probabilities that are less than 1 in free-ranging animal populations. Nowadays, these models can deal with the movement of animals between different locations and are also used to study transitions between different states. However, their use to estimate transitions between states does not account for uncertainty in state assignment. I present the extension of multievent models, which does incorporate this uncertainty. Multievent models belong to the family of hidden Markov models. I also show in this article that the memory model, in which the next state or location is influenced by the previous state occupied, can be fully treated within the framework of multievent models.

In 2011, we isolated a natural recombinant H9N2 avian influenza virus from fecal droppings of bean goose (Anser fabalis) in Korea. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the A/bean goose/Korea/220/2011(H9N2) isolate is a reassortant of Eurasian and North American lineages of avian influenza virus. In addition, the complete genome sequence, including all 8 gene segments, was associated with Chinese H9N2 viruses isolated from wild birds in the Hunan East Dongting Lake National Nature Reserve. These data provide direct evidence for the exchange of avian influenza viruses between Korea and China via wild birds.

Interferon (IFN)-induced myxovirus resistance (Mx) GTPases belong to the family of dynamin-like GTPases and control a diverse range of viruses. In this study, the identified goose Mx (goMx) mRNA is 2009bp long, shares partially conserved exons with other homologues, and shares highly conserved domains in its primary structure. The amino acid position 629 (629aa) of the goMx protein was identified as serine (Ser), in contrast to the Ser located at 631aa in chicken Mx, which is considered to be responsible for the lack of chicken Mx antiviral activity. In addition, the goMx 142aa residue in the dynamin family signature differs from that of other functional Mx proteins. Transcriptional analysis revealed that goMx was mainly expressed in the digestive, respiratory and immune systems in an age-specific manner. GoMx transcript levels in goose peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were found to be significantly up-regulated by various agonists and avian viruses. Furthermore, a time course study of the effects of H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV) on goMx expression in infected goslings suggested that H9N2 AIV affected goMx expression. However, significant changes in goMx expression were observed in the trachea, lung and small intestine of infected birds. Altogether, these results indicate that goMx protein may have acquired its broad antiviral activity by changing only a few amino acids at select sites, even as it shares a conserved architectures with species.

An adult swan goose (Anser cygnoides) kept in a zoological garden had gross hepatic enlargement with extensive ill-defined white foci. Microscopically, the hepatic lesions were composed of a mixture of adipocytes and myeloid cells. The goose was also affected with systemic amyloidosis and there were areas of osseous metaplasia associated with deposition of amyloid within the liver.

Yolk deposited by Japanese quail was abnormal for 24 hours after the oral administration of a single capsule containing 200 milligrams of bunker C oil. Both the structure and the staining properties of the yolk were affected. Fewer eggs were laid during the 4 days after dosing, compared to controls, and hatchability was drastically reduced. Hatchability returned to normal in 4 days. Three other reference oils also affected yolk structure. Canada geese given 2 grams and chickens given 500 milligrams of bunker C oil produced eggs with abnormal yolk rings.

Motivated by recent global reductions in biodiversity, empirical and theoretical research suggests that more species-rich systems exhibit enhanced productivity, nutrient cycling, or resistance to disturbance or invasion relative to systems with fewer species. In contrast, few data are available to assess the potential ecosystem-level importance of genetic diversity within species known to play a major functional role. Using a manipulative field experiment, we show that increasing genotypic diversity in a habitat-forming species (the seagrass Zostera marina) enhances community resistance to disturbance by grazing geese. The time required for recovery to near predisturbance densities also decreases with increasing eelgrass genotypic diversity. However, there is no effect of diversity on resilience, measured as the rate of shoot recovery after the disturbance, suggesting that more rapid recovery in diverse plots is due solely to differences in disturbance resistance. Genotypic diversity did not affect ecosystem processes in the absence of disturbance. Thus, our results suggest that genetic diversity, like species diversity, may be most important for enhancing the consistency and reliability of ecosystems by providing biological insurance against environmental change.

Since 1997, severe outbreaks of Newcastle disease (ND) in geese in many regions throughout China have resulted in high morbidity and mortality, and great economic loss to farmers; however, no licensed, specific vaccine is yet available for this disease in China. In this study, goslings were immunized with different combinations and dosages of several commercial ND vaccines including La Sota vaccine, Mukteswar vaccine, recombinant live vaccine against avian influenza (AI) and ND (rL-H5 strain), and inactivated ND oil-emulsion vaccine (La Sota strain). The protective effects were evaluated based upon the level of antibody response and the degree of protection against the goose-origin virulent NDV strain. The result showed that two doses (i.e., one more than that for chicken) of La Sota vaccine priming, followed by 2-5 doses of Mukteswar vaccine boosting 2-3 weeks later, not only induced higher HI antibody levels, but also conferred longer-lasting protection. This immunization procedure can be recommended for prevention of ND in geese.

Target cells for Goose parvovirus (GPV) in natural infection are still unknown. In this study, immune system organs namely the spleen, bone marrow, thymus, bursa of Fabricius, and blood of experimentally GPV-infected goslings were examined by an immunoassay and flow cytometry for the presence of viral antigen and by a PCR for viral genome. The results indicated that the virus replicated in some cells of the spleen and bone marrow, but not in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). These data suggested that some cell populations in the spleen and bone marrow were targets for GPV infection. In addition, the immunoassay used for the detection of GPV was found comparable with a PCR in reliability and sensitivity.

Two species, the cat and the goose, have been investigated to determine whether a variety of pharmacological mediators, irritants and allergens change the rate at which mucins (mucus glycoproteins) are secreted into the trachea. Mucins were labelled by the administration of radioactive precursors which the mucous cells took up and incorporated into glycoproteins. These were periodically washed out of a segment of trachea with physiological saline solution. Changes in the amount of mucin secreted were estimated from measurements of the amount of bound radioactivity in tracheal washings. Histamine increased mucin secretion but the effects were stronger and more consistent in the goose than in the cat. A variety of prostaglandins increased the secretion in both species. 5-Hydroxytryptamine failed to stimulate mucin output in the cat. Ammonia and cigarette smoke both increased mucin secretion in the cat and preliminary results suggest that this was by a combination of local and reflex mechanisms. O-Chlorobenzilidine malononitrile increased secretion from the goose trachea entirely by a local mechanism. Preliminary experiments in which sensitized cats were challenged by various routes have equivocal results on whether anaphylaxis increases airway mucin secretion. It is concluded that irritants cause mucin secretion both by reflexes and local mechanisms. The mechanisms for the latter may well include release of pharmacological mediators.

Hormonal regulation of thermogenesis in goslings. The effects of blockade with thiouracil and propranolol. Acta Physiol. Pol. 1977, 28 (1): 51-60. The experiments were carried out on 90 male goslings of White Italian breed. In goslings 5 to 7 and 18 to 21-day-old thiouracil (6 mg/100 g i.p., for 3 consecutive days) diminished the cold-induced increase in the metabolic rate. At the end of 1.5 h exposure to 5 degrees C a small but statistically significant drop of body temperature in the thiouracil-treated goslings was noted. Propranolol treatment (2 mg/kg s.c.) had no clear effect neither on body temperature of cold exposed goslings nor on the cold-induced increase in the metabolic rate. The drug caused a significant decrease in the plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels only in the goslings kept at thermoneutrality. In those exposed to 5 degrees C the plasma FFA levels rose both in the control and propranolol-treated goslings. This suggests that the cold-induced lipolysis in the goslings may be accomplished without mediation of noradrenaline.

Since 2002, high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) has spread from Asia to Europe and into Africa, causing the largest epizootic of HPAI of the last 50 yr, including infecting domestic and wild waterfowl. Our study was conducted to investigate whether a single vaccination of 7-day-old domestic ducks and geese with inactivated oil emulsion vaccines resulted in protection against HPAI virus challenge at 30 days of age. In ducks, some but not all vaccines decreased oropharyngeal and cloacal viral shedding for different periods postchallenge when compared with the sham group. In geese, decreased morbidity signs and mortality were noted but limited to some vaccines. Best protection was seen with a vaccine homologous to HPAI challenge virus. Limited decreases in oropharyngeal and cloacal viral shedding and mixed results were attained when looking at seroconversion. Our results indicate a single dose of oil-emulsified vaccine optimized for chickens did not provide adequate protection for ducks and geese against HPAI virus, and, at a minimum, additional research is needed to formulate waterfowl-specific vaccines.

The activities of certain drug metabolizing enzymes have been measured in liver and kidney slice preparations from domesticated birds. Aminopyrine demethylase activity was significantly lower in liver slices from the duck (Aylesbury X Pekin, Khaki-Campbell) than from the rat (Wistar), and in the Aylesbury X Pekin duck lower than in the turkey (Triple 6 FLX), chicken (Brown Leghorn, Rhode Island Red X Light Sussex) and goose (Emden X Doulouse). The microsomal cytochrome P-450 was lower in duck liver (Aylesbury X Pekin) than in rat liver, and the aniline hydroxylase and aminopyrine demethylase activities in a 10,000 g supernatant fraction of liver were lower in duck preparations (Aylesbury X Pekin, Khaki-Campbell) than rat preparations. These observations suggest that the duck is likely to be susceptible to drugs which are metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 containing mono-oxygenases. UDP-Glucuronyl transferase activity was not detectable in liver and kidney slices from two mature geese. This observation was not the outcome of a deficiency of UDP-glucuronic acid, rapid breakdown of glucuronide by beta-glucuronidase or the presence of a substance inhibitory to UDP-glucuronyl transferase. Liver slices from geese, ducks (Aylesbury X Pekin) and chickens contained low UDP-glucuronyl transferase and high sulphate conjugation enzyme activities, whereas the reverse was found in Khaki-Campbell ducks. The activities of UDP-glucuronyl transferase and the sulphate conjugation enzymes were both relatively high in liver slices from the turkey and rat. The kidney contained lower enzyme activities than the liver except in the duck (Aylesbury X Pekin), in which low activities of aminopyrine demethylase and UDP-glucuronyl transferase were present in slices of both organs. In liver slices from chickens and geese the activities of aminopyrine demethylase and the sulphate conjugation enzymes were similar in mature and immature birds, and the activity of UDP-glucuronyl transferase was considerably higher in chicks and goslings than in mature birds of the same species. In the chick the activities of aminopyrine demethylase, UDP-glucuronyl transferase and the sulphate conjugation enzymes were higher in the duodenum than the remainder of the alimentary tract. The activities of these enzymes in pieces of duodenum were as high as those in slices of liver. The inclusion of sulphate in the incubation medium produced a significant increase in the synthesis of p-nitrophenyl sulphate in liver slices and not kidney slices except those from the duck. The kidney slices seemed to produce sufficient sulphate for the reaction of the sulphate conjugation enzymes to proceed at the maximum rate, but the liver slices did not do so.

Over a 6-yr period, two cases of neoplastic disease were diagnosed among 1,272 wild Canada geese (Branta canadensis interior) collected in Illinois (USA), Wisconsin (USA), and Ontario, Canada. One juvenile goose of each sex was involved. In both cases > 35 discrete masses were observed subdermally, intramuscularly, and within the body cavity. The tumors, diagnosed as spindle cell sarcomas, are among the most commonly observed neoplasms in free-living North American waterfowl. Based on our data, we suggest that these neoplasms occur with extremely low prevalence (0.002%) in free-living Canada geese.

Two isolectins (ALA-I and ALA-II), were isolated from seed extracts of Artocarpus lakoocha by anion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose fast flow columns at pH 8.5 and 8.0 ALA-I was unbound to the column at pH 8.5 and moved towards the cathode in non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, whereas ALA-II possessed opposite properties. The two A. lakoocha agglutinins appeared to be composed of two dissimilar subunits (alpha and beta of M(r) 14,000 and 17,200) bound non-covalently. The isolectins possessed several similar properties including: blood type agglutination; pH optimum; pH and temp stability; as well as binding specificity towards asialomucins.

During the surveillance of avian influenza viruses in the Dongxi Lake wetland of Hubei in 2015-2016, an H11N9 avian influenza virus was isolated from a bean goose (Anser fabalis). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the HA gene of this isolate belongs to the North American lineage; however, the NA and the internal genes of the isolate were generated from the Eurasian lineage. This strain had reduced pathogenicity in mice and was capable of replication in the mouse lung without prior adaptation. This is the first report detecting H11N9 subtype influenza virus from migratory birds in central China. These findings highlight the transmission of avian influenza virus along the East Asian-Australian flyway and the need for continuing surveillance in central China.

Several outbreaks of Riemerella anatipestifer in commercial geese occurred within a short time period. A serious disease was recognized in the affected birds, mainly characterized by depression and severe neurologic disturbances. The morbidity ranged from 20 to 30% and the mortality from 5 to 20%. Generally, the clinical signs started at the age of 8 to 10 days. Post-mortem examination revealed fibrinous pericarditis, perihepatitis and airsacculitis in all birds. Some of the birds also had synovitis of the tibio-tarsal joints and oedematous swelling of the subcutaneous tissues around these joints and metatarsus. Histology revealed a characteristic severe inflammation with heterophilic granulocytes in different organs. Bacteriological investigation was made from several organs and R. anatipestifer could be isolated from all birds investigated. The identification of these clinical isolates, done for the first time by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry, confirmed the aetiology. Sequence analysis showed 100% similarity between the clinical isolates, indicating a common source of infection.

Immunological responses of wildfowl (Order Anseriformes: ducks, geese, swans and screamers) to mycobacteria have been investigated as part of studies to develop a vaccine and diagnostic assay for avian tuberculosis. 10(9) killed Mycobacterium vaccae protected the Cairinini (perching ducks) from avian tuberculosis (p<0.02) but did not achieve statistically significant protection in the other taxonomic tribes. The Cairinini includes the threatened, yet highly susceptible, white-winged duck (Cairina scutulata).Together, loss of cell-mediated responses to common mycobacterial antigens, increased responsiveness to the species specific antigens of M. avium, and increased antibody production are reminiscent of the T(H1) to T(H2) shift seen in mammalian mycobacterial infections. It is speculated that excessive exposure to environmental mycobacteria prior to vaccination is detrimental and common antigens play an important role in wildfowl immunity to mycobacteria. A new vaccination trial using killed M. vaccae is being undertaken. Antibody responses are a useful ante mortem diagnostic indicator in most taxonomic tribes with the exception of the primitive Dendrocygnini (whistling ducks).

The fatty acid synthetase of animal tissues consists of two identical subunits (Mr = 250,000), each of which is a multienzyme protein containing domains for the acyl carrier peptide and the seven different catalytic activities required for the conversion of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA to palmitate. Total poly(A+) RNA was isolated from goose uropygial gland and translated in a cell-free rabbit reticulocyte system. The translation products contained a polypeptide having the same molecular weight as the native synthetase subunits; this protein was specifically recognized by anti-synthetase antibodies and could be competed by excess native synthetase for antibody binding. Fractionation of the poly(A+) RNA by sucrose gradient centrifugation showed that synthetase mRNA is very large, repeatedly exhibiting a sedimentation coefficient of 35 S. Gel electrophoresis of this purified mRNA fraction following glyoxylation showed the presence of several species of RNA, one of which correlated well with the in vitro translation of the synthetase. This mRNA species has a molecular weight of 2.95 X 10(6), which is large enough to code for a protein with a molecular weight of 250,000. These results confirm the multifunctional nature of the synthetase and indicate that the synthetase subunit must arise as a single polypeptide chain synthesized from one contiguous mRNA.

Adiponectin and its receptors (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2) are novel endocrine systems that act at various levels to regulate metabolic homeostasis and reproductive processes. We cloned and characterized the cDNA of adiponectin and its receptors from the hypothalamus of the Huoyan goose to reveal the influence of these factors on the process of goose egg-laying. We also determined the mRNA and protein expression profiles during different stages of the egg-laying cycle.

Nucleotide sequence analysis of a recombinant cDNA for a duck alpha-globin gene indicates a gene with novel features and evolutionary history. The duck alpha-globin double-stranded cDNA, treated with S1 nuclease and tailed with poly(dC), was inserted into the PstI restriction endonuclease site of pBR322 tailed with poly(dG). Nucleotide sequence analysis of the resulting recombinant cDNA indicates that it contains the translated region and all of the 3' untranslated region for an alpha-globin gene. The sequence was determined by procedures designed especially for rapid analysis of pBR322 (PstI site) recombinant cDNAs. This duck globin has sequences related to the chicken alpha-A globin in some regions but in other regions it is more closely related to another alpha globin found in anemic chickens.

To determine whether an interaction between central respiratory and locomotor networks may be involved in the observed coordination of wingbeat and respiratory rhythms during free flight in birds, we examined the relationship between wingbeat and respiratory activity in decerebrate Canada geese and Pekin ducks before and after paralysis. Locomotor activity was induced through electrical stimulation of brain stem locomotor regions. Respiratory frequency (fv) was monitored via pneumotachography and intercostal electromyogram recordings before paralysis and via intercostal and cranial nerve IX electroneurogram recordings after paralysis. Wingbeat frequency (fW) was monitored using pectoralis major electromyogram recordings before, and electroneurogram recordings after, paralysis. Respiratory and cardiovascular responses of decerebrate birds during active (nonparalyzed) and "fictive" (paralyzed) wing activity were qualitatively similar to those of a variety of vertebrate species to exercise. As seen during free flight, wingbeat and respiratory rhythms were always coordinated during electrically induced wing activity. Before paralysis during active wing flapping, coupling ratios (fW/fv) of 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, and 4:1 (wingbeats per breath) were observed. After paralysis, fW and fv remained coupled; however, 1:1 coordination predominated. All animals tested (n = 9) showed 1:1 coordination. Two animals also showed brief periods of 2:1 coupling. It is clear that locomotor and respiratory networks interact on a central level to produce a synchronized output. The observation that the coordination between fW and fv differs in paralyzed and nonparalyzed birds suggests that peripheral feedback is involved in the modulation of a centrally derived coordination.

A total of 165 avian species (110 chickens, 15 turkeys, 12 ducks, 10 each of geese and guinea fowls, and 8 pigeons) were examined for blood protozoan parasites. Blood samples were collected from the wing veins and smears with Giemsa stain. Plasmodium spp. were found in 2 chickens (1.6%) and 7 turkeys (46.6%). 5 turkeys were clinical cases. 3 (37.5%) of the pigeons were positive for Haemoproteus spp. No blood parasites were found in geese, ducks, and guinea fowls. The results show that avian malaria can constitute a health problem in poultry, especially turkeys, in Nigeria. The avian species may act as a reservoir host for human malaria parasites.

A reverse phase liquid chromatographic (LC) method for the determination of chloramphenicol (CAP) residues in foies gras was tested. The method was based on acetonitrile-sodium chloride extraction, sample clean-up with hexane and purification on a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge. Acceptable chromatographic separation was obtained for thawed samples with two sample clean-up steps with hexane, a purification step with acetonitrile + water (87.5 + 12.5) (v/v) before the elution of CAP residues by a mixture of acetonitrile + water (70 + 30) (v/v) with a chromatographic separation on Spherisorb ODS-2 (5 microns) column using sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.3) + acetonitrile (78 + 22) (v/v) as mobile phase. The detection limit of the method was 2.5 micrograms/kg. The mean recovery from spiked samples at the 10 micrograms/kg level was 55.7 +/- 8.7%.

Lesser snow goose (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) goslings, approximately 5 weeks of age, were collected near the mouth of Tha-anne River, Northwest Territories, Canada, during mid-August 1991. Many dead goslings had been observed in the area from 1988 to 1990. Goslings from near the coast, where habitat degradation by grazing geese was severe, were smaller, weighed less, and had a greater prevalence of renal coccidiosis (Eimeria truncata) and cecal nematode (Trichostrongylus spp.) infection than did goslings from inland areas, where habitat destruction was not evident. Prevalence of infection with intestinal cestodes was greater at inland than at coastal sites. Prevalences of gizzard nematodes (Epomidiostomum spp.) and Leucocytozoon spp. were not significantly different at the two sites. Histological examination of kidneys and examination of kidney homogenates for oocysts were more sensitive methods than gross examination of the kidneys for detecting renal coccidial infection. The number of oocysts present in droppings was not a good indicator of the severity of renal coccidial infection in individual birds; however, the average number of oocysts in droppings was indicative of the average severity of infection among groups of goslings.

To assess genetic diversity in Cryptosporidium oocysts from Canada geese, 161 fecal samples from Canada geese in the United States were analyzed. Eleven (6.8%) were positive for Cryptosporidium spp. following nested PCR amplification of the hypervariable region of the 18S rRNA gene. Nine PCR products from geese were cloned and sequenced, and all nine diverged from previously reported Cryptosporidium 18S rRNA gene sequences. Five sequences were very similar or identical to each other but genetically distinct from that of Cryptosporidium baileyi; two were most closely related to, but genetically distinct from, the first five; and two were distinct from any other sequence analyzed. One additional sequence in the hypervariable region of the 18S rRNA gene isolated from a cormorant was identical to that of C. baileyi. Phylogenetic analysis provided evidence for new genotypes of Cryptosporidium species in Canada geese. Results of this study suggest that the taxonomy of Cryptosporidium species in geese is complex and that a more complete understanding of genetic diversity among these parasites will facilitate our understanding of oocyst sources and species in the environment.

Work is devoted to studying of circulation of avian flu influenza A (H5N1) virus at poultry in territory of Novosibirsk region in preepizootic period. 1901 sample from clinically healthy poultry is collected and investigated. On chicken embryos it has been isolated 28 virions, including from poultry of the industrial maintenance--16, from the poultry contained in private farmsteads--12. At the analysis of isolates it has been shown, that among poultry in preepizootic period circulated various serovars of influenza viruses namely, HI, H4 and H3 serogroups. The percent of isolates from geese of the industrial maintenance increased to 0.6% depending on area. The percent of isolates from a bird contained in private farmsteads, increased to 7.5%. The greatest percent of isolates was observed from the samples taken from hens--77. Thus, it is shown, that among poultry circulation of not pathogenic influenza viruses of type A is the usual phenomenon, and asymptomatic carriers 7.5% of a livestock. Also it has been established, that in preepizootic period 2005 (January-June) at poultry it is not revealed influenza viruses of H5 serotype, caused epizootia at Summer of 2005 in territory of Western Siberia.

The development of hyperpolarized tracers has been limited by short nuclear polarization lifetimes. The dominant relaxation mechanism for many hyperpolarized agents in solution arises from intramolecular nuclear dipole-dipole coupling modulated by molecular motion. It has been previously demonstrated that nuclear spin relaxation due to this mechanism can be removed by storing the nuclear polarization in long-lived, singlet-like states. In the case of N(2)O, storing the polarization of the nitrogen nuclei has been shown to substantially increase the polarization lifetime. The feasibility of utilizing N(2)O as a tracer is investigated by measuring the singlet-state lifetime of the N(2)O when dissolved in a variety of solvents including whole blood. Comparison of the singlet lifetime to longitudinal relaxation and between protonated and deuterated solvents is consistent with the dominance of spin-rotation relaxation, except in the case of blood.

The aim of this study was to perform flow cytometric analysis of C11-BODIPY581/591 oxidation in fowl and geese sperm as a marker for membrane lipid peroxidation (LPO) and to establish if the cryopreservation process would make sperm membranes more susceptible to oxidative stress. The experiment was carried out on 10 meat type line Flex roosters and 10 White Koluda® geese. The semen was collected two times a week, by dorso-abdominal massage method and pooled from 10 individuals of each species. Fowl semen samples were subjected to cryopreservation using the "pellet" method and Dimethylacetamide (DMA) as a cryoprotectant. Geese semen samples were cryopreserved in plastic straws in a programmable freezing unit with Dimethyloformamide (DMF) as the cryoprotectant. A fluorescent lipid probe C11-BODIPY581/591 provided with two double bonds that are oxidized during their contact with ROS, was used for the purpose of the assessment of the LPO in freshly diluted semen samples and frozen-thawed semen samples. This probe changes its color according to its state (non peroxidized: red; peroxidized: green). Flow cytometric analysis was used to monitor these changes. The White Koluda® geese fresh semen had a higher level of LPO than the Flex fresh semen (P > 0.01). The cryopreservation of fowl semen significantly (P > 0.01) increased the percentage of live and dead spermatozoa with lipid peroxidation. In frozen-thawed semen of White Koluda® geese the percentage of live spermatozoa with LPO significantly decreased (P > 0.05) whereas significantly (P > 0.01) higher level of dead cells with LPO was observed. There were significant differences between the two studied species. After thawing, the percentage of live and dead spermatozoa with lipid peroxidation was higher in fowl semen than in geese semen (P > 0.01). In conclusion, our data clearly indicate the existence of species specific differences in susceptibility of spermatozoa to the oxidation of PUFAs in the cell membranes, where such oxidation is caused by cryopreservation. This study shows that avian spermatozoa are vulnerable to radicals and frozenthawed sperm have higher level of LPO than fresh sperm. According to our observation, fowl semen is more susceptible to LPO than geese semen.

Precursors of neurohypophysial hormones are small proteins processed into nonapeptide hormones and neurophysins during axonal transport to the neurohypophysis. In mammals, oxytocin is associated with VLDV-neurophysin and vasopressin with MSEL-neurophysin. In birds, mesotocin and vasotocin are found instead of mammalian oxytocin and vasopressin. From goose, chicken and ostrich posterior pituitary glands, two types of neurophysins related to mammalian VLDV- and MSEL-neurophysins, respectively, have been identified by their N-terminal sequences. It is assumed that, as in mammals, hormonal peptide and the first 9 residues of the corresponding neurophysin are encoded by a common exon and that mesotocin and vasotocin, evolutionary predecessors of oxytocin and vasopressin, are associated in the precursors with VLDV-neurophysin and MSEL-neurophysin, respectively.

Goose (Anser anser) kidney microvillus sucrase-isomaltase (EC 3.2.1.48-EC3.2.1.10) was solubilized from isolated microvillus membranes using Emulphogen BC 720 or papain. Detergent-solubilized enzyme (D-SI) was purified 149 +/- 29 times with a yield of 15.7 +/- 2.6% by a two-step procedure which included chromatofocusing. The specific activity was 2.95 +/- 0.34 U/mg protein for sucrase, 1.02 +/- 0.13 for palatinase and 5.63 +/- 0.53 for maltase. D-SI was amphiphilic as indicated by its detergent-binding properties. These properties were not observed for sucrase-isomaltase released from the microvillus membrane by papain. The Mr of the enzyme purified after solubilization by Emulphogen and papain was 543,000 and 380,000, respectively, as determined by gel filtration. The difference in Mr indicates that an Emulphogen micelle is bound to the detergent-solubilized enzyme. In sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, sucrase-isomaltase migrated as several polypeptide chains: a major band (Mr 280,000) and at least seven additional minor bands (Mr 220,000-100,000). It is suggested that the major band represents the precursor pro-sucrase-isomaltase and that the lower molecular weight bands are generated by PMSF or aprotinin-resistant proteinases during homogenisation and chromatography of the enzyme. Measured by chromatofocusing, the isoelectric point was found to be pH 4.6. Sucrase-isomaltase accounts for about 20% of total microvillus membrane proteins.

We have determined the crystal structure of bar-headed goose haemoglobin in the oxy form to a resolution of 2.0 A. The R-factor of the model is 19.8%. The structure is similar to human HbA, but contacts between the subunits show slightly altered packing of the tetramer. Bar-headed goose blood shows a greatly elevated oxygen affinity compared to closely related species of geese. This is apparently due to a single proline to alanine mutation at the alpha 1 beta 1 interface which destabilises the T state of the protein. The beta chain N and C termini are well-localized, and together with other neighbouring basic groups they form a strongly positively charged groove at the entrance to the central cavity around the molecular dyad. The well-ordered conformation and the three-dimensional distribution of positive charges clearly indicate this area to be the inositol pentaphosphate binding site of bird haemoglobins.

The responsiveness of the POMC system to exogenous stimuli and the diurnal and seasonal rhythmicity of ACTH and beta-endorphin (beta E) in plasma were studied in outdoor-reared domestic ganders. Plasma levels of ACTH- and beta E-like immunoreactivities were determined by direct and specific radioimmunoassays. In the first series of experiments immunoreactive (ir) ACTH and beta E were measured in the plasma of male domestic geese after 5 min of ether stress and after administration of 2 micrograms/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Both ir-ACTH and ir-beta E levels increased 5 and 10 min after ether inhalation, but the increase in the ir-beta E concentration was only half that of the ir-ACTH. The plasma ir-ACTH levels were elevated after 60 and 120 min but not after 90 min of LPS administration: ir-beta E levels were unchanged at all time points. In a second series of experiments blood samples were taken on 30 March. 16 June, 4 August, and 27 October. On these days diurnal samplings were performed at 02:00, 06:00, 10:00, 14:00, 18:00, and 22:00 h. A two-way analysis of variance showed significant diurnal and seasonal changes for both hormones and significant interaction between the diurnal and seasonal levels. The highest daily mean values of the plasma ir-ACTH and ir-beta E concentrations were measured in June. The maximum of the ir-ACTH level was at 10:00 h in March and August, but at 22:00 h in June and October. The changes in ir-beta E concentrations paralleled those of ir-ACTH, but the changes did not reach statistical significance in every case.

Pharyngeal swabs were collected from 298 lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) at Banks Island (Northwest Territories. Canada) in the summer of 1994. Pasteurella multocida serotype 1 was isolated from an adult male bird and P. multocida serotype 3 was isolated from an adult female goose. Pathogenicity of the serotype 1 isolate was confirmed by inoculation in Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). The serotype 3 isolate was non-pathogenic in Pekin ducks. This is the first documented isolation of pathogenic P. multocida serotype 1 from apparently healthy wild snow geese.

Approximately 200 Canada geese (Branta canadensis) died at a playa lake in the Texas Panhandle shortly after a winter wheat field in the basin adjacent to the lake was treated with parathion to control newly invading Russian wheat aphids (Diuraphis noxia). No evidence of infectious disease was diagnosed during necropsies of geese. Brain ChE activities were depressed up to 77% below normal. Parathion residues in GI tract contents of geese ranged from 4 to 34 ppm. Based on this evidence, parathion was responsible for the goose mortalities. Parathion applications to winter wheat will undoubtedly increase if parathion is applied for control of both Russian wheat aphids and greenbugs (Schizaphis graminum). Geese may potentially be exposed to widespread applications of parathion from fall to spring, essentially their entire wintering period.

Pseudorabies virus grown in CPK cell cultures was tested for hemagglutination (HA) with erythrocytes of a variety of species at 4 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 37 degrees C. HA was observed at all temperatures with mouse erythrocytes but not with cattle, sheep, goat, swine, cat, rabbit, guinea pig, rat, mongolian gerbil, chicken, and goose erythrocytes. Mice showed a strain variation in agglutinability of their erythrocytes, requiring selection of mice to obtain erythrocytes for HA. The HA reaction was inhibited by specific antiserum. Some factors involved in the HA and HA-inhibition (HI) were investigated and standard HA and HI tests were established. HI antibody titers of individual pig sera showed a significant positive correlation with their neutralizing antibody titers.

The poor egg-laying rate of geese hinders the development of the goose industry; therefore, the reproductive performance of geese is an important area of investigation. To evaluate the relationship between photoperiod, reproductive hormones, and reproductive activity during the egg-laying cycle in geese under natural conditions, we collected blood samples from Sichuan white geese and Xupu geese to quantify changes in prolactin (PRL), estradiol (E2), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH), and luteinizing hormone (LH). We also calculated the rate of egg laying for the two populations during the egg-laying cycle. We show that the egg-laying rate and the serum concentration of some hormones (PRL, E2, VIP, FSH, GnIH, and LH) differed significantly between the two populations during the pre-laying, laying, and ceased-laying periods. Serum LH concentrations may be associated with maturation of the ovary and oviducts, whereas FSH, PRL, and GnIH play important roles in egg laying. These results provide a useful resource for future studies examining the laying rate in geese.

A severe infectious disease characterized by nephritis, hepatitis and splenitis has attacked goslings around Shandong province in China since 2016. A novel chicken-origin avian orthoreovirus (ARV) was isolated with LMH cells from affected goslings named Reo/Goose/SDPY/1116/17 (SDPY-ARV) strain, and the infection was successfully reproduced experimentally. The ARV-SDPY full genome sequencing was conducted using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technique on Illumina HiSeq platform. The complete genome of SDPY-ARV was 23,427 bp in length and consist of 10 dsRNA segments ranged from 1192 bp (S4) to 3958 bp (L1) which encoding 12 viral proteins. Genomic sequence analysis showed that the SDPY-ARV strain is in the same branch with broiler, pheasant-origin ARV isolates, and shares 51.8-96.2% of nucleotide identity of σC gene with them; while only 49.3-50.3% with waterfowl isolates. In addition, the occurrence of 10 segments genetic reassortment of SDPY strain is confirmed among the PA15511, the 1733 and the PA13649 strains from America. In conclusion, the causative agent of gosling hemorrhagic necrotic hepatitis and nephritis occurring in China is a novel chicken-origin goose orthoreovirus.

Nebraska's Rainwater Basin (RWB) is a key spring migration area for millions of waterfowl and other avian species. Avian cholera has been endemic in the RWB since the 1970s and in some years tens of thousands of waterfowl have died from the disease. We evaluated patterns of avian cholera mortality in waterfowl species using the RWB during the last quarter of the 20th century. Mortality patterns changed between the years before (1976-1988) and coincident with (1989-1999) the dramatic increases in lesser snow goose abundance and mortality. Lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) have commonly been associated with mortality events in the RWB and are known to carry virulent strains of Pasteurella multocida, the agent causing avian cholera. Lesser snow geese appeared to be the species most affected by avian cholera during 1989-1999; however, mortality in several other waterfowl species was positively correlated with lesser snow goose mortality. Coincident with increased lesser snow goose mortality, spring avian cholera outbreaks were detected earlier and ended earlier compared to 1976-1988. Dense concentrations of lesser snow geese may facilitate intraspecific disease transmission through bird-to-bird contact and wetland contamination. Rates of interspecific avian cholera transmission within the waterfowl community, however, are difficult to determine.

Goose erythrocytes were subjected to agents and treatments that produce echinocytosis in human erythrocytes. In the presence of the ionophore A23187 and calcium at greater than micromolar concentrations, goose red cells retained their normal ellipsoidal symmetry, but developed extensive semiregular membrane wrinkles or corrugations. Metabolic NTP (nucleoside triphosphate) depletion, induced either by iodoacetamide or by incubating the cells without a substrate, initially produced a similar cell corrugation, but after prolonged incubation most cells became spherical with the nucleus displaced to the cell periphery. The echinocytic agents indomethacin and dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine had no effect on the gross morphology of goose erythrocytes.

Influenza A viruses are usually non-pathogenic in wild aquatic birds, their natural reservoir. However, from May to July 2005, at Qinghai Lake in China, an unprecedented outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus caused the death of thousands of wild migratory waterbirds. Herein, H5N1 influenza virus from bar-headed geese collected during the outbreak was characterized. Genomic analysis showed that A/Bar-headed Goose/Qinghai/0510/05 (Bh H5N1 virus) is a reassortant virus. Amino acid residue (lysine) at position 627 in the PB2 gene of the Bh H5N1 virus was the same as that of the human H5N1 virus (A/HK/483/97) and different from that of H5N1 avian influenza viruses deposited in GenBank. Antigenic analysis showed that significant antigenic variation has occurred in the Bh H5N1 virus. The Bh H5N1 virus induced systemic infections and caused 100 % mortality in chickens and mice, and 80 % mortality in ducks and geese. Bh H5N1 virus titres were higher in multiple organs of chickens, ducks and geese than in mice, and caused more severe histological lesions in chickens, ducks and mice than in geese. These results support the need to pay close attention and create control programmes to prevent the transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus from wild migratory waterbirds into domestic chickens, ducks, geese and mammalian hosts.

The plaque-forming characteristics of Newcastle disease viruses of chickens and geese source were compared on various cells. The result showed that there were obvious differences of plaque formation between F48E9 and NA-1 on Vero cells, chicken embryo fibroblast cells (CEF) and goose embryo fibroblast cells (GEF). The plaque-forming ability of NA-1 was higher than F48E9 on GEF, but lower than F48E9 on CEF. On Vero cells, the plaque-forming ability of NA-1 was slightly stronger than F48E9. It demonstrated that the plaque-forming characteristics were consistent with host tropism of virus. The morphogenesis of F48E9 and NA-1 on Vero cells was observed with transmission electron microscope. There were different replication processes between F48E9 and NA-1 on cells at different stages. NA-1 had stronger adaptability to host than F48E9 according to budding processes and envelope integrity.

The virus was grown in MA 104 cells, a stable cell line derived from embryonic rhesus monkey kidney, and tested for hemagglutination (HA) with erythrocytes of a variety of species at 4 degrees C, room temperature and 37 degrees C. HA was observed at all temperatures with chicken, sheep, rabbit, guinea pig and human erythrocytes but not with horse, cattle, goat, swine and goose erythrocytes. HA reaction was inhibited by specific antiserum. Some factors involved in the HA and HA-inhibition (HI) were investigated and standard HA and HI tests were worked out. The HI test as well as neutralization test clearly distinguished ovine rotavirus from bovine, human, simian, equine, porcine and lapine rotaviruses.

To investigate the possibility of in ovo infection with avian bornavirus (ABV) in wild Canada geese (Branta canadensis), 53 eggs were opportunistically collected at various stages of embryonic development from 16 free-ranging goose nests at a large urban zoo site where ABV infection is known to be present in this species. ABV RNA was detected in the yolk of one of three unembryonated eggs using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. ABV RNA was not identified in the brains from 23 newly hatched goslings or 19 embryos, nor from three early whole embryos. Antibodies against ABV were not detected in the plasma of any of the hatched goslings using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Possible reasons for the failure to detect ABV RNA in hatchlings or embryos include low sample size, eggs deriving from parents not actively infected with ABV, the testing of only brain tissue, and failure of the virus to replicate in Canada goose embryos. In conclusion, this preliminary investigation demonstrating the presence of ABV RNA in the yolk of a Canada goose egg provides the first evidence for the potential for vertical transmission of ABV in waterfowl.

1. The avian eggshell is a biomineralised composite ceramic consisting of calcium carbonate embedded in an organic matrix. Matrix components are supposed to be involved in the control of mineralisation, crystallographic texture and biomechanical properties of eggshell. 2. The structure and eggshell matrix composition of various domesticated bird species were compared to gain insight into the universality of the eggshell mineralisation process. 3. The SDS-PAGE profiles of soluble eggshell matrix were specific within groups of birds (a: laying hen, breeder hen, quail, pheasant and possibly turkey; b: guinea fowl; c: duck and goose) but some of the protein bands were common to all groups. 4. Analogies between species were confirmed by Western blotting using hen protein antibodies. Ovocleidin-17 (OC-17) and ovalbumin were revealed in all species (except quail for OC-17). Lysozyme was present only in hen eggshell. Another egg white protein: ovotransferrin showed a positive signal in hens, turkey and quail. Osteopontin was observed in laying and breeder hens and quail. 5. Different proteoglycans were localised to discrete regions within the eggshell. Dermatan sulphate was observed within the matrix of the calcified shell of all species except quail which contained chondroitin-6-sulfate. Keratan sulphate was observed in mammillary bodies of breeder and laying hen, quail, pheasant and turkey while chondroitin sulphate was also present in guinea fowl and duck. 6. The general structural organisation of the different avian eggshells was similar but specific differences were observed in the ultrastructure of the mammillary layer. Species of the same taxonomic family could be grouped according to their structural analogies: breeder hen, turkey and pheasant resembled that of the domestic fowl. Guinea fowl was unique. Goose and duck were quite similar with large and confluent mammillary bodies. 7. Some matrix components are therefore common to eggshells of various species but more information is needed to relate differences in matrix composition between taxonomic groups with differences in ultrastructure.

The distribution, composition, and management characteristics of small "backyard" poultry flocks may have important implications in the spread of both avian diseases and zoonoses of public health concern. Although the prevalence of small poultry flocks has increased in Alberta, Canada, in recent years, there is minimal demographic information available for these populations. To gain initial epidemiologic insight into this growing population and potential areas of risk, a survey was conducted to characterize the sector. Information on flock demographics and bird health, as well as production and biosecurity practices, were gathered and analyzed from 206 surveys, representing respondents from 43 counties. These results revealed great diversity of both owners and flocks, characterized by wide variations in flock sizes and composition. Laying hens were the most commonly reported type of bird (93.4%), followed by ducks and geese (35.3%), turkeys, (33.8%), and broiler chickens (33.1%). Notably, 58.1% of owners reported having more than one type of bird in their flock, with many owners never, or only sometimes, separating flocks based on species or purpose. Personal consumption (81.8%) and sale of eggs (48.2%) were the most frequently cited purposes for owning a flock. Our findings suggest that owners in Alberta are predominantly new to production; most (73.1%) have kept birds for less than 5 yr and 25.6% for less than 1 yr. Flock health parameters revealed inconsistent use of medical interventions, such as vaccinations, treatments, and veterinary consultation. Data on the sourcing, housing, and movement of birds, as well as movement of people and visitors, reveal substantial potential for contact to occur directly and indirectly between flocks and humans. Additionally, basic husbandry and biosecurity practices were found to be inconsistent and often inadequate, highlighting important gaps and opportunities to improve the health of Alberta's small poultry flocks and mitigate risks to public health. These quantitative and qualitative results provide a baseline characterization of the sector and identify risks and challenges that may serve to inform the development and delivery of future study and interventions.

The chicken and goose egg white lysozymes (ChEWL and GoEWL) are homologues, but differ in substrate specificity. ChEWL catalyzes the hydrolysis of the glycosidic bonds of bacterial peptidoglycans and chitin-derived substrates, while GoEWL is specific for bacterial peptidoglycans. The active-site aspartate 52 residue of ChEWL, which is postulated to stabilize the oxocarbenium ion intermediate, has no counterpart in GoEWL. The substrate specificity of the D52A ChEWL mutant was compared with those of wild-type ChEWL and GoEWL. D52A ChEWL retains approximately 4% of the wild-type catalytic activity in reactions with three different bacterial cell suspensions. Asp52 therefore is not essential to the catalytic mechanism, accounting for only a 2 kcal/mol decrease in delta G++. The function of Asp52 in D52A ChEWL- and GoEWL-catalyzed cleavage of (carboxymethyl)chitin may be partially fulfilled by an appropriately positioned carboxyl group on the substrate (substrate-assisted catalysis). D52A ChEWL and GoEWL, unlike wild-type ChEWL, exhibit biphasic kinetics in the clearing of Micrococcus luteus cell suspensions, suggesting preferences for subsets of the linkages in the M. luteus peptidoglycan. These subsets do not exist in the peptidoglycans of Escherichia coli or Sarcina lutea, since neither D52A ChEWL nor GoEWL exhibits initial bursts in reactions with suspensions of these bacteria. We propose that substrate-assisted catalysis occurs in reactions of D52A ChEWL and GoEWL with M. luteus peptidoglycans, with the glycine carboxyl group of un-cross-linked peptides attached to N-acetylmuramic acid partially substituting the function of the missing Asp52.

To obtain estimates for the prevalence of Toxoplasma gondii infection in ducks and geese in Germany, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were established based on affinity-purified T. gondii tachyzoite surface antigen 1 (TgSAG1) and used to examine duck and goose sera for T. gondii-specific antibodies. The results of 186 sera from 60 non-infected ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and 101 sera from 36 non-infected geese (Anser anser) as well as 72 sera from 11 ducks and 89 sera from 12 geese inoculated experimentally with T. gondii tachyzoites (intravenously) or oocysts (orally) and positive in a T. gondii immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) were used to select a cut-off value for the TgSAG1-ELISA. Sera obtained by serial bleeding of experimentally inoculated ducks and geese were tested to analyze the time course of anti-TgSAG1 antibodies after inoculation and to assess the sensitivity of the assays in comparison with IFAT. In ducks, IFAT titres and ELISA indices peaked 2 and 5 weeks p.i with tachyzoites, respectively. Only three of six geese inoculated with tachyzoites at the same time as the ducks elicited a low and non-permanent antibody response as detected by the IFAT. In the TgSAG1-ELISA, only a slight increase of the ELISA indices was observed in four of six tachyzoite-inoculated geese. By contrast, inoculation of ducks and geese with oocysts led to an increase in anti-TgSAG1 antibodies within 1 or 2 weeks, which were still detectable at the end of the observation period, i.e. 11 weeks p.i. Inoculation of three ducks and three geese with oocysts of Hammondia hammondi, a protozoon closely related to T. gondii, resulted in a transient seroconversion in ducks and geese as measured by IFAT or TgSAG1-ELISA. Using the newly established TgSAG1-ELISA, sera from naturally exposed ducks and geese sampled in the course of a monitoring program for avian influenza were examined for antibodies to T. gondii; 145/2534 (5.7%) of the ducks and 94/373 (25.2%) of the geese had antibodies against TgSAG1. Seropositive animals were detected on 20 of 61 duck and in 11 of 13 goose farms; the seroprevalences within positive submissions of single farms ranged from 2.2% to 78.6%. Farms keeping ducks or geese exclusively indoors had a significantly lower risk (odds ratio 0.05, 95% confidence interval 0.01-0.3) of harboring serologically positive animals as compared with farms where the animals had access to an enclosure outside the barn.

An outbreak of hepatic cirrhosis in a flock of young geese was investigated. The affected geese were cyanotic with purple beaks, shanks and footwebs. On post mortem examination severe atrophy of the liver was seen and, histologically, extensive areas of necrosis, cirrhosis and bile duct proliferation were prominent. Liver function tests and serum enzyme levels confirmed that the liver damage was extensive. The findings are compared with those found in aflatoxicosis of other avian species.

The present study was conducted to establish a sandwich ELISA for the determination of prolactin (PRL) concentrations in the plasma of domestic fowls. The assay uses a recombinant goose PRL as the reference standard, expressed in a eukaryotic system, and as the antigen for raising a polyclonal antibody in rabbit. This rabbit anti-goose PRL polyclonal antibody was used for coating the wells of the ELISA plate, and its biotinylated form served as the detection antibody. An avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase was used to bind the detection antibody and to catalyze the chromogenic reaction using 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine as the substrate. The assay showed a linear relationship between the optical density and concentration of the standard PRL in the 0 to 12.5 ng/mL range, and the assay was sensitive to a concentration as low as 0.39 ng/mL. The intra- and inter-assay CVs were <7% and 11%, respectively. The response curves of the serially diluted plasma samples from goose, duck, and chicken exhibited similar parallel relationships to that observed for the reference standards. Consistent with previous findings, the assay effectively detected differences in PRL concentration in plasma samples from chicken, duck, and goose at various reproductive stages.

Crystal structures of Atlantic cod lysozyme have been solved with and without ligand bound in the active site to 1.7 and 1.9 A resolution, respectively. The structures reveal the presence of NAG in the substrate binding sites at both sides of the catalytic Glu73, hence allowing the first crystallographic description of the goose-type (g-type) lysozyme E-G binding sites. In addition, two aspartic acid residues suggested to participate in catalysis (Asp101 and Asp90) were mutated to alanine. Muramidase activity data for two single mutants and one double mutant demonstrates that both residues are involved in catalysis, but Asp101 is the more critical of the two. The structures and activity data suggest that a water molecule is the nucleophile completing the catalytic reaction, and the roles of the aspartic acids are to ensure proper positioning of the catalytic water.

1. Salt-gland blood flow in the domestic goose has been measured using a combination of Sapirstein's indicator fractionation technique for organ blood flow and Fegler's thermodilution method for cardiac output.2. Nasal salt secretion was induced by giving 0.5 M-NaCl or 0.154 M-NaCl I.V. or by giving artificial sea water by stomach tube into the proventriculus.3. During secretion, salt-gland blood flow increased from 82.7 +/- 21.9 ml./100 g tissue. min to as high as 2179 ml./100 g. min (mean 1209 +/- 140).4. The rate of secretion in response to salt loading was very variable and was not correlated with the rate of blood flow.5. From the data obtained, it could be calculated that the median values for the percentage extraction of ions from the arterial plasma were Na 15%, K 35%, Cl 21% and water 5.8%.6. Atropine abolished secretion but not the increase in blood flow produced by salt loading.7. Unilateral complete denervation abolished secretion from and the increase in blood flow through the operated but not the control gland.8. Anaesthesia, induced by pentobarbitone sodium, almost completely blocked secretion and the increase in blood flow in the salt-gland in response to salt loading.9. In geese given 0.5 or 0.154 M-NaCl I.V. a positive, significant correlation was found between the total amount of nasal secretion collected over 30 min and the concentrations of Na and Cl in the nasal fluid. However, when the time course of secretion was followed in any one bird, the rate of secretion was inversely related to the concentrations of Na and Cl.10. Harderian gland blood flow was not affected by salt loading.

The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of Listeria, Salmonella, and Yersinia spp. isolated from duck and goose intestinal contents. A total of 471 samples, including 291 duck and 180 goose intestinal contents, were purchased from wet markets between November 2008 and July 2010. Listeria, Salmonella, and Yersinia spp. were isolated from 58 (12.3%), 107 (22.7%), and 80 (17%) of the samples, respectively. It was concluded that Listeria ivanovii, Salmonella Thompson, and Yersinia enterocolitica were the predominant serovars among Listeria, Salmonella, and Yersinia spp., respectively. Moreover, resistance to tetracycline was common in Listeria (48.3%) and Salmonella spp. (63.6%), whereas 51.3% of the Yersinia spp. isolates were resistant to cephalothin. Therefore, continued surveillance of the prevalence of the pathogens and also of emerging antibiotic resistance is needed to render possible the recognition of foods that may represent risks and also ensure the effective treatment of listeriosis, salmonellosis, and yersiniosis.

An 18-month-old, male greylag goose was presented for assessment of multiple, semi-pedunculated cutaneous masses limited to non-feathered areas of skin. Initial biopsy and histopathology revealed a mesenchymal neoplasm suggestive of lipoblastomatosis or atypical xanthoma. Immunohistochemistry was unsuccessful in determining the tissue type of origin. Surgical resection of all masses was prevented by the mucocutaneous location of several masses. Chemotherapy using intralesion cisplatin was unsuccessful in resolving the masses but was well-tolerated by the goose. Serum lipid and lipoprotein analysis revealed a persistent hypercholesterolaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia without biochemical evidence of an underlying metabolic disease. The persistent hyperlipidaemia may have contributed to the formation of the masses identified in this case.

The goose is usually considered to be resistant even to strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) that are markedly virulent for chickens. However, ND outbreaks have been frequently reported in goose flocks in China since the late 1990s with the concurrent emergence of genotype VIId NDV in chickens. Although the NDVs isolated from both chickens and geese in the past 15 years have been predominantly VIId viruses, published data comparing goose- and chicken-originated ND viruses are scarce and controversial.

Wild geese are a potential source of Campylobacter infection for humans and farm animals and have been implicated in at least two large waterborne disease outbreaks. There have been few investigations into the population biology of Campylobacter in geese, carriage rates are reported to vary (0 to 100%), and no genetic characterization of isolates has been performed. Fecal samples collected from wild geese in Oxfordshire, United Kingdom, were culture positive for C. jejuni (50.2%) and C. coli (0.3%). The C. jejuni (n = 166) isolates were characterized by using multilocus sequence typing and were compared with isolates collected from free-range broiler chickens and wild starlings sampled at the same location. A total of 38 STs, six clonal complexes, and 23 flaA SVR nucleotide STs were identified. The ST-21 and ST-45 complexes (5.4% of isolates) were the only complexes to be identified among isolates from the geese and the other bird species sampled in the same location. These clonal complexes were also identified among human disease isolates collected in the same health care region. The results indicate that large numbers of wild geese carry Campylobacter; however, there was limited mixing of Campylobacter populations among the different sources examined, and the host source could be predicted with high probability from the allelic profile of a C. jejuni isolate. In conclusion, genotypes of C. jejuni isolated from geese are highly host specific, and a comparison with isolates from Oxfordshire cases of human disease revealed that while geese cannot be excluded as a source of infection for humans and farm animals, their contribution is likely to be minor.

Given evidence that the immune system is sensitive to environmental contaminants, evaluating immunocompetence in toxicology studies is increasingly important. By incorporating a test of humoral response into controlled reproductive and developmental studies, more comprehensive results can be gathered to assess the potential for disease. The foreign red blood cells (RBC) challenge is a minimally invasive method for evaluating humoral responses to a foreign antigen. Typically, antibody response is assessed following injections of sheep erythrocytes; however, Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) are only minimally sensitive to sheep RBC. In the present study, adult Japanese quail were treated with 5% solutions of RBC from goose, goat, cow, donkey, or pig in primary and secondary challenges. After each treatment, plasma samples were taken and antibody responses were measured for total immunoglobulins (Ig), IgG, and IgM. Overall, goose RBC generated the poorest responses in both primary and secondary challenges, while the strongest antibody responses were to pig and donkey RBC. Therefore, pig RBC appear to be a superior antigen for testing humoral response in Japanese quail.

This work demonstrates that spermatozoa from five avian species (chicken, turkey, guinea fowl, duck and goose) are all characterised by high proportions of polyunsaturated fatty acids, from 46 (turkey) to 55% (duck) of total. For each of the species, the most abundant fatty acids were arachidonic (20:4n-6) and docosatetraenoic (22:4n-6) acids, representing between 22 (turkey) and 40% (chicken) of total. Significant activities of the major isozymes of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, which protect against the peroxidation associated with high degree of fatty acid unsaturation, were found in spermatozoa from all species. The seminal plasma also had these activities and showed additional mechanisms for protecting spermatozoa from peroxidation. In general terms, these lipid and enzyme proteins were similar between the five avian species and different from those reported for mammalian sperm.

The sensitivity of Streptococcus faecalis (ATTC 8043) to S. zymogenes X-14 bacteriocin depends greatly on its physiological age. Sensitivity decreases from the mid-log phase on and is completely lost in the stationary phase. The sensitivity of erythrocytes to the hemolytic capacity of the bacteriocin showed considerable species variation. The order of increasing sensitivity was goose < sheep < dog < horse < human < rabbit. However, when red cell stromata were used as inhibitors of hemolysis in a standard system employing rabbit erythrocytes the order of increasing effectiveness was sheep < rabbit < human < horse < goose. When rabbit cells were used in varying concentrations with a constant hemolysin concentration, there was a lag of about 30 min, which for a given hemolysin preparation was constant for all red cell concentrations. Furthermore, the rate of hemolysis increased with increasing red cell concentration. If red cells are held constant and lysin varied, the time to reach half-maximal lysis varies directly with lysin but is not strictly proportional. Bacterial membranes were one to three orders of magnitude more effective than red cell stromata as inhibitors. The order of increasing effectiveness seems to be Escherichia coli < Bacillus megaterium < S. faecalis < Micrococcus lysodeikticus. In addition to membranes, a d-alanine containing glycerol teichoic acid, trypsin in high concentration, and deoxyribonuclease also inhibited hemolysis. Ribonuclease, d-alanine, l-alanine, dl-alanyl-dl-alanine, N-acetyl-d-alanine, N-acetyl-l-alanine did not inhibit hemolysis.

Interferons are a group of antiviral cytokines acting as the first line of defense in the antiviral immunity. Here, we describe the antiviral activity of goose type I interferon (IFNα) and type II interferon (IFNγ) against duck plague virus (DPV). Recombinant goose IFNα and IFNγ proteins of approximately 20 kDa and 18 kDa, respectively, were expressed. Following DPV-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) infection of duck embryo fibroblast cells (DEFs) with IFNα and IFNγ pre-treatment, the number of viral gene copies decreased more than 100-fold, with viral titers dropping approximately 100-fold. Compared to the control, DPV-EGFP cell positivity was decreased by goose IFNα and IFNγ at 36 hpi (3.89%; 0.79%) and 48 hpi (17.05%; 5.58%). In accordance with interferon-stimulated genes being the "workhorse" of IFN activity, the expression of duck myxovirus resistance (Mx) and oligoadenylate synthetases-like (OASL) was significantly upregulated (p < 0.001) by IFN treatment for 24 h. Interestingly, duck cells and goose cells showed a similar trend of increased ISG expression after goose IFNα and IFNγ pretreatment. Another interesting observation is that the positive feedback regulation of type I IFN and type II IFN by goose IFNα and IFNγ was confirmed in waterfowl for the first time. These results suggest that the antiviral activities of goose IFNα and IFNγ can likely be attributed to the potency with which downstream genes are induced by interferon. These findings will contribute to our understanding of the functional significance of the interferon antiviral system in aquatic birds and to the development of interferon-based prophylactic and therapeutic approaches against viral disease.

The prevalence of hematozoa (diagnosed from blood films) in a sample of 4200 anatids representing 14 species collected in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island during the period 1969-1973 is given. Thirty percent of the birds harboured hematozoa; the commonest blood parasite was Haemoproteus (Parahaemoproteus) nettionis (in 18% of the sample), followed by Leucocytozoom simondi (in 14% of the sample). Four species of Plasmodium occurred in 5% of the sample-Plasmodium circumflexum was the most frequently encountered of the four. Prevalence of infection varied markedly from year to year and locality to locality. Ducks from Northwestern New Brunswick-Bathurst area were the most heavily infected while those from Prince Edward Island had a low hematozoan prevalence. Black ducks (anas rubripes) were the most heavily infected of the 14 species of waterfowl sampled and possibly hematozoa may act as a limiting factor on populations of this duck. Bluewing teal (Anas discors) showed the lowest prevalence (7.1%) of the 14 species studied and the prevalence was in marked contrast to that of the greenwing teal (ANAS CAROLINENSIS) (39.5%).

A total of 1991 environmental samples of fresh avian feces and urine from several aquatic bird species in a coastal area of Northeast Germany were examined for the presence of avian influenza viruses (AIV). By real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, specific for an M gene of influenza A viruses, none of 659 duck samples and only 11 (0.9%) of 1,268 geese and swan samples tested positive. Two of these were identified as H5N2 viruses of low pathogenicity. Conventional cloacal and oropharyngeal swab samples (n=1,402) collected in an adjacent coastal region in Northeast Germany from comparable species of captured or hunted birds, yielded a similar detection rate (3/901; 0.4%) for AIV-specific RNA in geese and swans, but a higher rate (4/309; 1%) for ducks. No virus isolates were obtained from either set of samples. Collection of environmental avian samples was simple and cost effective and also allowed us to regulate sample sizes over time. A species assignment of these samples was possible, provided that close presampling observation of birds at the sampling sites was secured. Environmental sampling to monitor AIV in wild bird populations may be a valid alternative to the more-invasive and capture-dependent methods based on cloacal sampling.

Bacterial populations can display high levels of genetic structuring but the forces that influence this are incompletely understood. Here, by combining modelling approaches with multilocus sequence data for the zoonotic pathogen Campylobacter, we investigated how ecological factors such as niche (host) separation relate to population structure. We analysed seven housekeeping genes from published C. jejuni and C. coli isolate collections from a range of food and wild animal sources as well as abiotic environments. By reconstructing genetic structure and the patterns of ancestry, we quantified C. jejuni host association, inferred ancestral populations, investigated genetic admixture in different hosts and determined the host origin of recombinant C. jejuni alleles found in hybrid C. coli lineages. Phylogenetically distinct C. jejuni lineages were associated with phylogenetically distinct wild birds. However, in the farm environment, phylogenetically distant host animals shared several C. jejuni lineages that could not be segregated according to host origin using these analyses. Furthermore, of the introgressed C. jejuni alleles found in C. coli lineages, 73% were attributed to genotypes associated with food animals. Our results are consistent with an evolutionary scenario where distinct Campylobacter lineages are associated with different host species but the ecological factors that maintain this are different in domestic animals such that phylogenetically distant animals can harbour closely related strains.

The synovial membrane (SM) of some representatives of four terrestrial vertebrate classes was studied by means of scanning electron microscope (SEM). The figures of SM of the mammals (man, mini-pig), birds (fowl, Gallus domesticus L.), reptiles (lizard, Lacerta viridis Laur. and turtle, Testudo graeca L.) and amphibians (frog, Rana esculanta L.) are documented. The SM of all animal species investigated presents a great locally variable appearance in form and surface arrangement of the living cells. The surface of synoviocytes is mostly very rough, forked, the cells having a plenty of wart-like, spiny-like or leaf-like microvilli, with cytoplasmic projections protruding from cell bodies. The largest possible functional surface of SM in mammals is formed by multiple villi and folds, whereas in other animal classes--by a specific arrangement of the lining cells. Locally variable appearance of synoviocytes from human and rabbit joints was described by Date (1979); we have documented the same in birds, reptiles and amphibians, as well. Three characteristic types of locally variable appearance of the surface lining cells were picked out in representatives of the every animal class cited. These cells correspond to the histological types, classified by Key. Beside these basic types, a number of transitory cells appear, that increase the diversity of the appearance of the lining cells in different regions of the SM. We may conclude that all the synoviocytes present the largest possible functional surface, although their external form differs. Their cytoplasm contains all sorts of organelles necessary for synthesis and secretion of mucopolysaccharides of the synovial liquid, as well as for the resorption and phagocytosis.

Melatonin receptor sites were characterized in the brains of four avian species (duck, goose, pigeon, and turkey) by an in vitro binding technique, using 2-[125I]iodomelatonin as a labeled ligand. The specific binding of 2-[125I]iodomelatonin to avian brain membranes was found to be stable, saturable, reversible, and of high affinity. Scatchard analysis revealed that 2-[125I]iodomelatonin binds to a single class of sites in brain membrane preparations of these species with high affinity (affinity constants Kd between 153 and 289 pM) and low capacity (total number of binding sites B(max) between 5.07 and 10.15 fmol/mg protein). Competition studies showed the following relative order of potency of indolic compounds to inhibit the specific 2-[125I]iodomelatonin binding: melatonin >> N-acetyltryptamine > N-acetyl-5-hydroxytryptamine > 5-hydroxytryptamine >>> 5-methoxytryptamine. We conclude that the 2-[125I]iodomelatonin-binding sites in brains of duck, goose, pigeon, and turkey have similar binding and pharmacological characteristics, and may represent ML-1 melatonin receptor sites.

The life cycle and morphology of a previously undescribed species of Cryptosporidium isolated from commercial broiler chickens is described. The prepatent period for Cryptosporidium baileyi n. sp. was three days post oral inoculation (PI) of oocysts, and the patent period was days 4-24 PI for chickens inoculated at two days of age and days 4-14 for chickens inoculated at one and six months of age. During the first three days PI, most developmental stages of C. baileyi were found in the microvillous region of enterocytes of the ileum and large intestine. By day 4 PI, most parasites occurred in enterocytes of the cloaca and bursa of Fabricius (BF). Mature Type I meronts with eight merozoites first appeared 12 h PI and measured 5.0 x 4.9 micrometers. Mature Type II meronts with four merozoites and a large granular residuum first appeared 48 h PI and measured 5.1 x 5.1 micrometers. Type III meronts with eight short merozoites and a large homogeneous residuum first appeared 72 h PI and measured 5.2 x 5.1 micrometers. Microgamonts (4.0 x 4.0 micrometers) produced approximately 16 microgametes that penetrated into macrogametes (4.7 x 4.7 micrometers). Macrogametes gave rise to two types of oocysts that sporulated within the host cells. Most were thick-walled oocysts (6.3 x 5.2 micrometers), the resistant forms that passed unaltered in the feces. Some were thin-walled oocysts whose wall (membrane) readily ruptured upon release from the host cell. Sporozoites from thin-walled oocysts were observed penetrating enterocytes in mucosal smears. The presence of thin-walled, autoinfective oocysts and the recycling of Type I meronts may explain why chickens develop heavy intestinal infections lasting up to 21 days. Oocysts of C. baileyi were inoculated orally into several animals to determine its host specificity. Cryptosporidium baileyi did not produce infections in suckling mice and goats or in two-day-old or two-week-old quail. One of six 10-day-old turkeys had small numbers of asexual stages only in the BF. Four of six one-day-old turkeys developed mild infections only in the BF, and sexual stages of the parasite were observed in only one of the four. All seven one-day-old ducks and seven two-day-old geese developed heavy infections only in the BF with all known developmental stages present.

Starting from the epidemiological investigation on a sample of 22.560 subjects of different chronological age classes in the Latium region with the research of hemoagglutinoinhibiting antibodies of the Rubella virus, and of 9.800 subjects with the research of hemoagglutinoinhibiting antibodies of the Measles virus, the authors observe that the diffusion of the seroprotection presents on an average 82.5% for Rubella and 79.8% for Measles. On the strength of the results, referred also according to the established chronological age classes, any obligatory treatment against Rubella is excluded in prepuberal age. In order to prevent the risk of congenital malformation in cases of pregnant and not seroprotected subjects who, during the first three months of gestation might come into contact with sick affected by Rosolia or with healthy carriers, the authors suggest the vaccination three months before the conception. Evidently, this involves a screening of the adult female population before their marriage. On the contrary as concerns Measles, the vaccination within the second year of life is being hypothesized exactly on the basis of the consideration that this is a matter of a serious illness and not always free from grave complications. In these cases, after shortly referring on the results of the experiments of different authors, the mixed anti-Measles and anti-Rubella vaccination might be taken into consideration, though with all the precautions that are suggested.

We present an implementation of the absolute quantification (AQUA) method for monitoring of peptide abundance in complex mixtures of processed proteins. Specific peptide markers from meats (chicken, duck, goose, pork and beef) and common protein allergenic additives (soy, milk and egg white preparations) were chosen and synthesised with stable isotopes (13C and 15N) for use as internal standards. A wide range of food samples, from cooked or raw meat to sterilised pâté, was analysed by a triggered multiple reaction monitoring mode experiment and triple quadrupole mass spectrometry for the direct measure of tryptic peptides representing the amounts of specific proteins. Considerable differences among the abundances of meat and non-meat proteins were observed, and illegal addition and replacement of ingredients were discovered, i.e. undeclared addition of pork and egg white proteins, and illegal substitution of veal, goose and duck meat with cheaper pork.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus grown on MARC-145 cell cultures was tested for hemagglutination (HA) with erythrocytes from a variety of species at 4 degrees C, room temperature and 37 degrees C. HA was observed at all temperatures with mouse erythrocytes but not with cattle, sheep, goat, horse, swine, guinea pig, mongolian gerbil, goose and chicken erythrocytes. The HA activity was enhanced by treatment of virus materials with Tween 80 followed by treatment with ether. The HA titer and HA pattern of virus materials treated with Tween 80 and ether (TE) were 4- to 8-fold higher and more clear than those of the virus materials without TE treatment. The optimum conditions consisted in pretreatment of virus material with Tween 80 at a final concentration of 0.06-0.125% (v/ v) for 15-60 min followed by treatment with ether at a concentration of 50% (v/v) for 5-15 min in ice bath with continuous shaking. The curve of active virus production in intra- and extracellular virus samples resembled that of HA production although it rose somewhat earlier in intracellular virus samples. The HA reaction was inhibited by specific antiserum. HI antibody titers of individual pig sera showed a significant positive correlation with their neutralizing antibody titers.

Duck parvovirus (DPV) and Goose parvovirus (GPV) isolated from infected waterfowls with Derzsy's disease in the year 1999 were identified by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. The nucleotide sequences of their viral capsid proteins (VPs) show that they share 77% similarity at the DNA, and 84.6% at the protein level. The most variable region between DPV and GPV resides in the N-terminal of VP2 before the initiation codon of VP3 with 35% (19/54) amino acids divergence. Viral capsid protein sequences diverge 4.1 to 4.4% among 1990-99 isolated strains. Variant amino acids cluster in the common regions of VP3 at residues 203-266 and 482-534 which overlaps with the regions proposed to expose on the outer surfaces of parvoviral particles, implying that selective pressure from host immune system might play a part. These data provide useful information for antigenic epitope prediction. This study also reveal the presence of conserved strain-specific residues in VPs and these residues seldom vary among different viral isolates, suggesting that they might be functionally important and worth further investigation.

In contrast to conventional commercial poultry, which are raised primarily in controlled indoor environments, backyard poultry are typically raised in less restricted settings, potentially exposing them to a greater variety of ingestible substances, including multiple types of forage. Consequently, problems such as gastrointestinal impactions caused by ingesta have been noted in backyard poultry. To determine the prevalence of these impactions in backyard poultry, we performed a retrospective database search for autopsy submissions to the California Animal Health and Food Safety laboratory system and found that gastrointestinal impaction was associated with the death of 42 backyard poultry cases (40 chickens, 1 turkey, and 1 goose) from January 2013 to July 2018. In 32 of these 42 (76%) cases, the impaction was caused by fibrous plant material, 7 (17%) by compacted feed, and 3 (7%) by miscellaneous ingesta (tortilla, plastic, and wood shavings). The large proportion of grass impactions indicate that foraging is the predominant source of impaction material in backyard poultry, and that long grasses may be a significant health hazard for poultry. Backyard, pasture-raised, and free-range poultry producers are advised to maintain short pastures, avoid feeds that may expand in the gastrointestinal tract, and provide adequate grit to prevent impactions.

Currently, both goose astrovirus (GoAstV) and goose-origin Newcastle disease virus (NDV) are widely infectious agents for goslings. There is no vaccine for GoAstV. Capsid protein can elicit a neutralizing antibody in human astroviruses (HAstV). Molecular analysis of the genomic region encoding the capsid protein(ORF2) of goose astrovirus has revealed that it contains neutralizing epitopes. Goose-origin NDV is also an infectious agent. A wide range of NDV strains exist that can be commonly used as vaccine vectors. In the present study, the fusion protein cleavage site RRQKR↓F in a backbone of the virulent goose-origin NDV SH-12 was changed into an avirulent motif GRQGR↓L. The modified goose-origin NDV recombinant vaccine virus expressing the Capsid protein (Cap) of GoAstV was generated as a bivalent vaccine using a reverse-genetics approach. The recombinant virus, rNDV/GoAstV-Cap, was attenuated and similar growth dynamics, cytopathic effects, and virus titers in vitro were maintained when compared to the LaSota strain. Expression of the GoAstV-Cap protein in rNDV/GoAstV-Cap infected cells was detected by an immunofluorescence assay and Western blotting. Goslings inoculated with rNDV/GoAstV-Cap showed no apparent signs of disease and induced GoAstV-Cap-specific immune responses and NDV-specific serum antibody responses to a LaSota vaccination control. Complete protection against a pathogenic GoAstV challenge and avelogenic NDV challenge was conferred. The results of the study suggested that rNDV/GoAstV-Cap viruses have the potential to be the safe, stable, and effective bivalent vaccines.

In 2016, the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N8 virus was detected in wild birds for the first time in Egypt. In the present study, we identified the HPAI virus H5N8 of clade 2.3.4.4 from domestic waterfowl in Egypt, suggesting its transmission to the domestic poultry from the migratory birds. Based on partial haemagglutinin gene sequence, this virus has a close genetic relationship with subtype H5N8 viruses circulating in Asia and Europe. Pathologically, H5N8 virus in hybrid duck induced nervous signs accompanied by encephalomalacia, haemorrhages, nonsuppurative encephalitis and nonsuppurative vasculitis. The granular layer of cerebellum showed multifocal areas of hydropic degeneration and the Purkinje cell neurons were necrotized or lost. Additionally, the lung, kidney and spleen were congested, and necrotizing pancreatitis was also observed. The co-circulation of both HPAI H5N1 and H5N8 subtypes with the low pathogenic avian influenza H9N2 subtype complicate the control of avian influenza in Egypt with the possibility of emergence of new reassortant viruses. Therefore, continuous monitoring with implementation of strict control measures is required. Research highlights HPAI H5N8 virus clade 2.3.4.4 was detected in domestic ducks and geese in Egypt in 2017. Phylogenetically, the virus was closely related to HPAI H5N8 viruses identified in Asia and Europe Nonsuppurative encephalitis was widely observed in HPAI H5N8 virus-infected ducks. Degeneration of the cerebellar granular layer was found in most of the brain tissues examined.

A novel complexometric dye- and transition-metal-based post-column detection system for polyanions, called 'metal-dye detection' has been developed. This technique, combined with a new h.p.l.c. separation protocol, permits a direct highly-isomer-selective determination of bis- to poly-phosphorylated non-radioactively labelled compounds in the picomolar range, a sensitivity hitherto unknown for these substances. The application of the technique in the quantitative microanalysis of inositol polyphosphates from milligram amounts of cells or tissue specimens is described. The technique promises to answer hitherto unresolved questions about the role of inositol phosphates, especially those in intact tissues, which are not readily amenable to analysis by radioisotopic techniques.

It has been indicated that fatty acid synthase (FAS) is abnormally overexpressed in human breast cancer compared with normal human tissue. Inhibition of FAS induces apoptosis of human breast cancer cells. The aim of this study was to observe the inhibition of triclosan on FAS from goose uropygial glands for establishing the method and to study the inhibition of triclosan on FAS from human breast cancer SKBr3 cells in vitro.

The identification of the species of origin of meat and meat products is an important issue to prevent and detect frauds that might have economic, ethical and health implications. In this paper we evaluated the potential of the next generation semiconductor based sequencing technology (Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine) for the identification of DNA from meat species (pig, horse, cattle, sheep, rabbit, chicken, turkey, pheasant, duck, goose and pigeon) as well as from human and rat in DNA mixtures through the sequencing of PCR products obtained from different couples of universal primers that amplify 12S and 16S rRNA mitochondrial DNA genes. Six libraries were produced including PCR products obtained separately from 13 species or from DNA mixtures containing DNA from all species or only avian or only mammalian species at equimolar concentration or at 1:10 or 1:50 ratios for pig and horse DNA. Sequencing obtained a total of 33,294,511 called nucleotides of which 29,109,688 with Q20 (87.43%) in a total of 215,944 reads. Different alignment algorithms were used to assign the species based on sequence data. Error rate calculated after confirmation of the obtained sequences by Sanger sequencing ranged from 0.0003 to 0.02 for the different species. Correlation about the number of reads per species between different libraries was high for mammalian species (0.97) and lower for avian species (0.70). PCR competition limited the efficiency of amplification and sequencing for avian species for some primer pairs. Detection of low level of pig and horse DNA was possible with reads obtained from different primer pairs. The sequencing of the products obtained from different universal PCR primers could be a useful strategy to overcome potential problems of amplification. Based on these results, the Ion Torrent technology can be applied for the identification of meat species in DNA mixtures.

Governments, NGOs, and natural scientists have increased research and policy-making collaborations with Indigenous peoples for governing natural resources, including official co-management regimes. However, there is continuing dissatisfaction with such collaborations, and calls for better communication and mutual learning to create more ‘‘adaptive’’ co-management regimes. This, however, requires that both Western and Indigenous knowledge systems be equal participants in the ‘‘co-production’’ of regulatory data. In this article, I examine the power dynamics of one co-management regulatory regime, conducting a multi-sited ethnography of the practices of researching and managing one transnational migratory species, greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons frontalis), who nest where Koyukon Athabascans in Alaska, USA, practice subsistence. Analyzing the ethnographic data through the literatures of critical geography, science studies and Indigenous Studies, I describe how the practice of researching for co-management can produce conflict. ‘‘Scaling’’ the data for the co-management regime can marginalize Indigenous understandings of human– environment relations. While Enlightenment-based practices in wildlife biology avoid ‘‘anthropomorphism,’’ Indigenous Studies describes identities that operate through non-modern, deeply imbricated human–nonhuman identities that do not separate ‘‘nature’’ and ‘‘society’’ in making knowledge. Thus, misunderstanding the ‘‘nature’’ of their collaborations causes biologists and managers to measure and research the system in ways that erase how subsistence- based Indigenous groups already ‘‘manage’’ wildlife: by living through their ethical commitments to their fellow beings. At the end of the article, I discuss how managers might learn from these ontological and epistemologicaldifferences to better ‘‘co-produce’’ data for co-management.

1. Egg white proteins from the eggs of domestic chicken (Gallus gallus), turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), duck (Anas platyrhynchos) and goose (Anser anser) were analysed in order to compare the antimicrobial activity of these products. 2. Albumen from each species was sampled and analysed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Antimicrobial activity and lysozyme activity were measured. 3. Ovotransferrin and ovalbumin were identified in all species while c-type lysozyme was present in chicken, turkey and duck egg white samples, but not in goose. 4. Galliformes appear to possess albumens with greater antimicrobial activity than those of the Anseriformes. This can be attributed to higher concentrations of ovotransferrin and the broad acting c-type lysozyme.

Antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii were assayed by ELISA in 22 experimentally inoculated domestic ducks. In addition, a serological assay was carried out at Obihiro, Hokkaido, Japan, in 2004 and 2005, on 221 wild ducks of 5 species: Anas platyrhynchus (n = 111); A. poecilorhyncha (n = 27); A. acuta (n = 58); A. penelope (n = 16); and A. crecca (n = 9). Assays were also conducted using sera from 197 wild geese of 2 species, i.e., Anser albifrons (n = 162) and Ans. fabalis (n = 35). Birds were collected between 2003 and 2005 from 3 different areas: Lake Miyajima-numa, Hokkaido, Japan, regions around Anadyr city of Chukotka autonomous okrug, and Lake Makobetukoe, Kamchatka oblast, Russia. The ELISA cutoff value (OD) was > or =0.395 based on results from uninfected ducks; the final dilution ratio recognized as positive was represented by the end titer. The end titer in the experimentally infected ducks ranged from 1:400 to 1:3,200. Antibodies to T. gondii were found in 49 of the 221 wild duck samples from Japan: A. platyrhynchus (22/74); A. poecilorhyncha (2/15); A. penelope (3/16); A. acuta (4/58); and A. crecca (0/9), all in 2004. In 2005, T. gondii was found in A. platyrhynchus (13/37); and A. poecilorhyncha (5/12). Thirty-two of 197 wild goose samples were seropositive, i.e., Ans. albifrons (7/51) in 2004 and (11/72) in 2005 in Miyajima-numa, Japan and 9/39 in Chukotka, Russia as well as in Ans. fabalis (5/35) in Kamchatka, for which the end titer ranged from 1:100 to 1:3,200. In immunoblotting, the A. platyrhynchus samples showed specific IgG antibody binding to several antigens in the T. gondii lane, i.e., at 30 and 43 kDa, but not in the Neospora caninum lane. No specific bands were noted in samples for which antibody activity was not detected. These results suggest that wild waterfowl inhabiting Hokkaido, Chukotka, and Kamchatka may be exposed to T. gondii.

As a result of immunological examination of 658 domestic ducks of 6 poultry farms and 269 doves caught in Vilnius, antiornithosis antibodies were revealed in 3.1 +/- 0.7% of ducks and in 36.4 +/- 2.9% of doves. They were also found in 20 of 34 wild waterfowl. The causative agent of ornithosis was isolated in virological examination of the organs of a coot. Ornithosis nature of an epizootic outbreak among ducks of a poultry farm was proved by virological examination. The population was examined immunologically (2285 persons) and by intradermal test with the ornithosis antigen (80 persons). Positive specific reactions were revealed in 32.6% of persons engaged in poultry tending, and in 7.6% of other rural population. A case of ornithosis in man engaged in fowling (of doves) for their examination is described.

Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae causes erysipelas in many vertebrate species. Severe disease outbreaks have been noted in many poultry species--chickens, ducks, emus, pheasants, pigeons, and geese. This article describes the biochemical and genetic analyses of six E. rhusiopathiae strains isolated from geese for meat production. The isolates came from birds kept in different poultry houses on one farm, and were collected during two erysipelas outbreaks. We analyzed and compared the isolates by random amplified polymorphic DNA with the use of NK6 primer and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, with the restriction enzyme SmaI. Biochemical examination was performed with API Coryne test. Analyses showed that the three strains isolated during the first outbreak differed, whereas the three isolates from the second outbreak were identical to one another, but distinct from the isolates from the first outbreak. The results of biochemical and genetic analyses of E. rhusiopathiae strains isolated from geese suggest different sources of infection for the erysipelas outbreaks.

Antigens for Grand Arbaud, Hazara, and California arboviruses were able to agglutinate goose and either dog, hamster and guinea pig, or hamster red blood cells (RBC) to the same titer at the same pH; in hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) tests, titers for homologous and related sera were the same with these different types of RBC or occasionally one dilution higher with the mammalian cells. Antigens for St. Louis encephalitis and Eastern equine encephalitis viruses required use of lower antigen dilutions with human, guinea pig, and hamster RBC than with goose RBC. The results of comparative HI testing with these latter antigens and types of RBC indicate that HI titer is not directly related to the antigen dilution used with different types of RBC.

A comprehensive approach to the analysis of anticoagulant rodenticide residues in animal tissues based on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has been developed. Residues of warfarin, coumatetralyl, difenacoum, brodifacoum, bromadiolone, diphacinone and chlorophacinone were extracted with chloroformacetone (1:1, v/v). Extracts were cleaned-up by an integrated gel permeation and adsorption chromatographic procedure which divided the rodenticides into two groups. Residues were then determined and confirmed using normal-phase, ion-pair and weak ion-exchange HPLC techniques. Ion-pair gradient separation resolved all seven rodenticides in a single chromatographic analysis. UV detection methods were employed for all seven rodenticides. Use of a diode array detection system permitted additional confirmation of residues down to 0.1 mg kg-1 by matching UV spectra and derivatives of spectra. Sensitive fluorescence detection was possible for the coumarin-based rodenticides but not for diphacinone and chlorophacinone. Post-column pH-switching fluorescence detection methods were shown to be superior to other methods of fluorescence detection of coumarin-based rodenticides. Recoveries from spiked liver tissue were around 90% at levels from 0.05 to 1 mg kg-1. Detection limits of around 0.002 mg kg-1 for most rodenticides and of 0.01 mg kg-1 for warfarin could be achieved with animal tissue extracts.

Ten representative isolates of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) obtained from outbreaks in waterfowl (geese and ducks) in China since 1997 were characterized both pathotypically and genotypically. The mean death time and intracerebral pathogenicity index were used to evaluate the virulence of the isolates. Pathogenicity tests showed that all 10 isolates were velogenic strains. The main functional region of the F gene made up of 535 nucleotides was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of the fusion protein cleavage site in all 10 isolates was 112RRQKRF117, which is a typical sequence of velogenic strains and is in agreement with the results of in vivo pathogenicity tests. For genotyping, a phylogenetic tree based on nucleotides 47-435 of the F gene was constructed. Phylogenetic analysis showed that most of the isolates were of the genotype VII virus. Only one strain, WG, was found to be of the genotype IX virus. This strain was closest to F48E9, which was isolated in China in 1946 and has been used as a standard challenge strain in vaccine evaluation in China. So, genotype IX virus still causes sporadic infections in geese in China. Further phylogenetic analyses on the genotype VII strains found that all these strains can be subdivided into 5 subgenotypes, and most of the isolates (8 strains) were classified as VIId, a predominant genotype responsible for most Newcastle disease (ND) outbreaks since the end of the past century in China. Only 1 strain, NDV03-053, was shown to be of genotype VIIc virus. Results indicate that the strains of genotype VIId NDV have been the major pathogen, responsible for most epizootic ND outbreaks in waterfowl in China since 1997.

The anaerobic intestinal spirochaete Brachyspira pilosicoli colonizes the large intestine of various species of mammals and birds, where it may induce colitis. Strains of the spirochaete have also been isolated from the bloodstream of immunocompromised human patients and have been seen in liver sections, and a similar systemic spread was recently observed in experimentally infected chickens. Some other spirochaete species that may be present in blood attach to and aggregate erythrocytes, and this is believed to contribute to disease severity. The aim of the current study was to determine whether B. pilosicoli strains have the capacity to attach to and aggregate erythrocytes. Initially, four strains of B. pilosicoli were incubated with erythrocytes from sheep, cows, pigs, dogs, humans, chickens and geese, and were observed by phase-contrast microscopy. Only strain WesB attached, and this was only with erythrocytes from chickens and geese. Subsequently, six other strains of B. pilosicoli were tested just with goose erythrocytes, and five attached to and caused aggregation of the erythrocytes. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that spirochaetes abutted and apparently firmly attached to the erythrocyte membranes. Aggregation of erythrocytes by B. pilosicoli may contribute to disease severity in species that develop a spirochaetaemia.

Pelvic limb deformities are common in many avian species. Three young birds, including a six-week-old Cockatoo and two three-month-old goslings, were presented with tarsal joint deformities. They were treated with an experimental prototype of a hinged linear external fixator, placed in a transarticular fashion, in order to maintain joint function during treatment. All birds had close to normal leg function at six to ten weeks postoperatively. These results suggest that the hinged external fixator may be a viable treatment option for tarsal joint deformities in young birds.

In the spring of 1975, an epornitic of avian cholera in Nebraska affected wild waterfowl, common crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos), and a captive flock of guant Canada geese (Branta canadensis maxima). Measures taken to control the disease in the captive geese included flushing the water of their pen with fresh well water, parenteral (50mg oxytetracycline intramuscularly) and feed (tetracycline 500 g/ton) antibiotic treatment, and removing dead waterfowl and crows from the pen, and keeping wild waterfowl and crows out of the pen. Other measures taken to prevent a recurrence of the outbreak included monitoring the area with susceptible sentinel birds and culturing nasal swabs for Pasteurella multocida. Young Canada geese and wood ducks (Aix sponsa) raised in the area also were cultured before release to assure that carriers would not be released into the wild. Presently, ponds in the pen have been dried up so that the area is less attractive to wild waterfowl. Swine feeders and waterers that have been modified to discourage their use by crows are being used to feed and water the geese.

Up to 12% mortality occurred in goslings between 4 and 11 days of age in two sequential hatches from a single breeder flock. Respiratory signs were noted before the birds died. The most consistent necropsy finding was a white opaque plug of fibrin and cellular debris in the trachea. The tracheal epithelium was hyperplastic and metaplastic with intranuclear inclusion bodies present in superficial cells. An adenovirus was isolated in both chicken and goose embryo liver cells.

Duck virus enteritis (DVE), also called duck plague, is one of the major contagious and fatal diseases of ducks, geese and swan. It is caused by duck enteritis virus (DEV)/Anatid herpesvirus-1 of the genus Mardivirus, family Herpesviridae, and subfamily Alpha-herpesvirinae. Of note, DVE has worldwide distribution, wherein migratory waterfowl plays a crucial role in its transmission within and between continents. Furthermore, horizontal and/ or vertical transmission plays a significant role in disease spread through oral-fecal discharges. Either of sexes from varying age groups of ducks is vulnerable to DVE. The disease is characterized by sudden death, vascular damage and subsequent internal hemorrhage, lesions in lymphoid organs, digestive mucosal eruptions, severe diarrhea and degenerative lesions in parenchymatous organs. Huge economic losses are connected with acute nature of the disease, increased morbidity and mortality (5%-100%), condemnations of carcasses, decreased egg production and hatchability. Although clinical manifestations and histopathology can provide preliminary diagnosis, the confirmatory diagnosis involves virus isolation and detection using serological and molecular tests. For prophylaxis, both live-attenuated and killed vaccines are being used in broiler and breeder ducks above 2 weeks of age. Since DEV is capable of becoming latent as well as shed intermittently, recombinant subunit and DNA vaccines either alone or in combination (polyvalent) are being targeted for its benign prevention. This review describes DEV, epidemiology, transmission, the disease (DVE), pathogenesis, and advances in diagnosis, vaccination and antiviral agents/therapies along with appropriate prevention and control strategies.

We describe a conserved family of bacterial gene products that includes the VirB1 virulence factor encoded by tumor-inducing plasmids of Agrobacterium spp., proteins involved in conjugative DNA transfer of broad-host-range bacterial plasmids, and gene products that may be involved in invasion by Shigella spp. and Salmonella enterica. Sequence analysis and structural modeling show that the proteins in this group are related to chicken egg white lysozyme and are likely to adopt a lysozyme-like structural fold. Based on their similarity to lysozyme, we predict that these proteins have glycosidase activity. Iterative data base searches with three conserved sequence motifs from this protein family detect a more distant relationship to bacterial and bacteriophage lytic transglycosylases, and goose egg white lysozyme. Two acidic residues in the VirB1 protein of Agrobacterium tumefaciens form a putative catalytic dyad, Each of these residues was changed into the corresponding amide by site-directed mutagenesis. Strains of A. tumefaciens that express mutated VirB1 proteins have a significantly reduced virulence. We hypothesize that many bacterial proteins involved in export of macromolecules belong to a widespread class of hydrolases and cleave beta-1,4-glycosidic bonds as part of their function.

Gangliosides on the cells surface can act as the Newcastle disease virus receptors, but the differences of receptor specificities between Newcastle disease virus strains isolated from different avian species have not been determined. Accordingly, we attempted to determine the difference of binding specificity to gangliosides between two Newcastle disease virus NA-1 (goose-origin) and F48E9 (chicken-origin).

Goose haemorrhagic polyomavirus (GHPV) is the viral agent of haemorrhagic nephritis enteritis of geese, a lethal disease of goslings. It was recently shown that GHPV can also be detected in Muscovy and mule ducks. The goal of the present study was to investigate the pathobiology of GHPV in ducks. In the first experiment, field isolates of GHPV from Muscovy or mule ducks were fully sequenced and compared with goose GHPV. These duck isolates were then used to inoculate 1-day-old goslings. Typical clinical signs and lesions of haemorrhagic nephritis enteritis of geese were reproduced, indicating that "duck-GHPV" isolates are virulent in geese. In the second experiment, 1-day-old and 21-day-old Muscovy ducklings were infected by a reference GHPV strain. In both cases, neither clinical signs nor histopathological lesions were observed. However, the virus was detected in cloacal bursae and sera, and serological responses were detected at 12 days post infection. These findings suggest firstly that one common genotype of GHPV circulates among ducks and geese, and secondly that ducks may be infected by GHPV but show no pathologic evidence of infection, whereas geese express clinical signs. GHPV infection should therefore be considered as being carried in ducks and of epidemiological relevance in cases of contact with goose flocks.

A double-stranded cDNA library constructed from the total poly(A+) RNA of goose uropygial gland was screened for recombinants containing sequences complementary to malic enzyme mRNA. Replicate arrays of 1400 colonies were hybridized independently with 32P-labeled cDNAs copied from two populations of hepatic RNA derived from tissues which differed by about 35-fold with respect to the relative synthesis of malic enzyme. Forty-eight of the colonies which gave differential signals were further screened by hybrid-selected translation. DNA from one of these contained an insert of 970 base pairs and selected an mRNA which directed the synthesis of malic enzyme in a cell-free system. The malic enzyme sequences were subcloned into the single-stranded bacteriophage M13mp8. The subclones were used to prepare 32P-labeled single-stranded hybridization probe. Northern analysis indicated that malic enzyme mRNA from both goose and chicken is about 2100 bases in length. Hepatic malic enzyme mRNA concentration is stimulated 30- to 50-fold or more when neonatal chicks or goslings, respectively, are fed for 24 h. When added to chick embryo hepatocytes in culture, triiodothyronine stimulated malic enzyme mRNA accumulation by more than 100-fold. Glucagon inhibited the thyroid hormone-stimulated accumulation of malic enzyme mRNA by 99%. In all instances, malic enzyme mRNA concentration was closely correlated with the relative rate of malic enzyme synthesis. These results suggest that nutritional and hormonal regulation of malic enzyme synthesis occurs at the pretranslational level.

In late 2014, a H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus, clade 2.3.4.4, spread by migratory waterfowl into North America reassorting with low pathogenicity AI viruses to produce a H5N2 HPAI virus. Since domestic waterfowl are common backyard poultry frequently in contact with wild waterfowl, the infectivity, transmissibility, and pathogenicity of the United States H5 HPAI index viruses (H5N8 and H5N2) was investigated in domestic ducks and geese. Ducks infected with the viruses had an increase in body temperature but no or mild clinical signs. Infected geese did not show increase in body temperature and most only had mild clinical signs; however, some geese presented severe neurological signs. Ducks became infected and transmitted the viruses to contacts when inoculated with high virus doses [(104 and 106 50% embryo infective dose (EID50)], but not with a lower dose (102 EID50). Geese inoculated with the H5N8 virus became infected regardless of the virus dose given, and transmitted the virus to direct contacts. Only geese inoculated with the higher doses of the H5N2 and their contacts became infected, indicating differences in infectivity between the two viruses and the two waterfowl species. Geese shed higher titers of virus and for a longer period of time than ducks. In conclusion, the H5 HPAI viruses can infect domestic waterfowl and easily transmit to contact birds, with geese being more susceptible to infection and disease than ducks. The disease is mostly asymptomatic, but infected birds shed virus for several days representing a risk to other poultry species.

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of dietary n-6:n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) ratios on heterophil:lymphocyte (H:L) ratios and T cell subsets in the peripheral blood of the growing Yangzhou goose. A total of 160 healthy Yangzhou geese (0.407 ± 0.023 kg), aged 21 d, were randomly divided into 4 groups consisting of diets with different n-6:n-3 PUFA ratios: 12:1, 9:1, 6:1, and 3:1. White blood cell counts and H:L ratios were measured at 42, 56, and 70 d of age; T lymphocyte subsets were also analyzed using monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry simultaneously. The results showed that differences were found in white blood cells between groups (P < 0.05) but not within groups (P > 0.05), and white blood cells of 70-d-old geese were significantly higher than those of other ages within the same group. The H:L ratios of all groups decreased as age increased, and differences were found in 6:1 and 3:1 groups between ages (P < 0.05). As for the comparison of H:L ratio between treatments, 6:1 and 3:1 were lower than the other 2 groups at 42 or 70 d of age (P < 0.05), and 3:1 was lower than the other 3 groups at 56 d of age (P < 0.05). Moreover, H:L ratios had a tendency to decrease with the decrease of n-6:n-3 PUFA ratios. Furthermore, cluster of differentiation (CD) 3(+) and CD8(+) increased gradually, whereas CD4(+) and CD4(+):CD8(+) ratios first increased and then decreased as age increased. Differences were detected in T cell subsets among ages (P < 0.05). In addition, CD4(+) and CD4(+):CD8(+) ratios were affected remarkably by n-6:n-3 PUFA ratios but CD3(+) and CD8(+) were not, and 6:1 had much higher CD4(+) percentage and CD4(+):CD8(+) ratio compared with the other groups (P < 0.05). Taken together, diets containing low n-6:n-3 PUFA ratios could decrease H:L ratios in the peripheral blood. Additionally, CD4(+) percentage and CD4(+):CD8(+) ratio were much higher in the 6:1 group, which could be relevant for improving positive immune responses for Yangzhou goslings from 42 to 70 d of age.

Five geese flocks were surveyed to gather data on the prevalence and clinical manifestation of traumatic myiasis and the fly species involved. Myiasis was recorded in all the flocks and the total number of infested geese was 26 (ca. 0.1% of the total numbers). The first cases were observed at the end of May, the last ones in August. Most birds (16/26) were infested in August. Each affected goose had only one lesion, which was located more frequently on the wings (14/26) than on any other body. In seven geese, Wohlfahrtia magnifica (Diptera: Sarcophagidae) was the only myiasis-causing species. In these cases the detransformed mean number of larvae per wound was 18.1 (range 5-40). Lucilia sericata (Diptera: Calliphoridae) was found to be solely responsible for the lesions of 12 birds, with detransformed mean of 94.0 (range 2-893) larvae per goose. The larvae of this species appeared to be generally less invasive than those of W. magnifica, but in three cases they were also deeply embedded in the wounds. In seven geese larvae of both fly species developed together in and around the wounds. With the exception of one lesion, there were more larvae of W. magnifica (detransformed mean of 21.8 with a range of 1-55) than that of L. sericata (detransformed mean of 11.2 with a range of 2-61) in these mixed infections. Predisposing conditions for development of traumatic myiasis in geese included plucking of feathers, other injuries and bacterial infections (e.g. inflammation of the phallus).

Duck tembusu virus (DTMUV) is an emerging agent that causes a severe disease in ducks. We report herein the first complete genome sequences of duck tembusu virus strains YY5, ZJ-407, and GH-2, isolated from Shaoxing ducks, breeder ducks, and geese, respectively, in China. The genomes of YY5, ZJ-407, and GH-2 are all 10,990 nucleotides (nt) in length and encode a putative polyprotein of 3,426 amino acids. It is flanked by a 5' and a 3' noncoding region (NCR) of 94 and 618 nt, respectively. Knowledge of the whole sequence of DTMUV will be useful for further studies of the mechanisms of virus replication and pathogenesis.

Male-specific bacteriophage (MSB) densities were determined in animal and human fecal wastes to assess their potential impact on aquatic environments. Fecal samples (1,031) from cattle, chickens, dairy cows, dogs, ducks, geese, goats, hogs, horses, seagulls, sheep, and humans as well as 64 sewerage samples were examined for MSB. All animal species were found to harbor MSB, although the great majority excreted these viruses at very low levels. The results from this study demonstrate that in areas affected by both human and animal wastes, wastewater treatment plants are the principal contributors of MSB to fresh, estuarine, and marine waters.

Experiments were conducted to compare endogenous amino acid losses and the true amino acid availability (TAAA) of 3 feedstuffs by using methods involving a short-term fasting and an N-free diet with cecectomized ganders. Diets were formulated to contain soybean meal, fish meal, and cottonseed meal as the sole source of protein. A precision-fed assay was used in which each feed sample was precise-fed (60 g) to geese and excreta were collected for 48 h. A N-free diet and fasting methods were used to evaluate the endogenous amino acid losses. Endogenous losses of 3 amino acids were significantly different (P < 0.01) with the N-free diet and fasting methods. The TAAA of soybean meal, fish meal, and cottonseed meal determined by N-free diet method ranged from 84.49 to 97.09%, 89.18 to 98.16%, and 77.09 to 98.32%, respectively. The TAAA of these 3 diets determined by the fasting method ranged from 83.50 to 97.77%, 88.08 to 99.60%, and 76.09 to 98.09%, respectively. However, there were only a few small differences (P > 0.05) between methods in each amino acid. In conclusion, there was no difference in determination of the amino acid availability of these feedstuffs using cecectomized ganders between the N-free diet and fasting methods.

Lysozyme-synthesizing activity of a large collection of cultures of lactic-acid bacteria isolated from various natural substrates has been studied. It is shown that the degree of lysozyme production depends on the source of bacteria isolation. Representatives of Enterococcus genus isolated from the digestive tract of long-living people, as well as fishes, geese and ducks are most active among the coccal forms. Manifestation of lysozyme-synthesizing activity in lactobacilli depends on the group and species belonging of strains. It is established that the capacity to produce lysozyme can serve a diagnostic characteristic under identification of lactobacillus of subgenus Betabacterium. Lysozyme produced by lactic acid bacteria is one of the components in the total complex of the mechanism of biological activity of this important group of microorganisms.

1. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of dietary fibre sources on growth and on the development of the gastro-intestinal tract in growing geese. 2. Six-week-old female White Roman geese were divided at random into 6 groups with 6 dietary treatments. Diets were isoenergetic and isonitrogenous and contained alfalfa meal, barley bran, rice hulls, cellulose, pectin or lignin as the major dietary source of fibre. 3. Food intake was significantly higher in the barley bran group than in the other groups. Both daily weight gain and food conversion of the pectin and alfalfa meal groups were lower than those of the other groups. 4. In the 9-week-old geese, the relative weight and the length of the small intestine did not significantly differ among treatment groups. However, the relative weight was significantly lightest and the caecal length was significantly shortest (P < 0.05) in the pectin group. 5. Activities of amylase and cellulose hydrolases of the caecal contents were also highest in the pectin group. 6. From SEM micrographs, no morphological damage of the villi was observable in the different intestinal segments of the geese in any of the treatments.

Goose parvovirus is the etiological agent of Derzsy's disease, a fatal hepatitis of young geese. The virus infects geese and Muscovy ducks and can be propagated in the laboratory in primary embryonic goose fibroblasts. To date the virus has only been classified by morphological, biochemical, and culture characteristics as an autonomous parvovirus. We now report the cloning and partial sequencing of 3434 nucleotides of the viral genome. Three overlapping clones were obtained, encoding regions in the nonstructural and capsid coding region. The nucleotide sequence show little homology to other autonomous parvoviruses but 55% homology to the dependovirus AAV2. The homology to AAV2 was also confirmed at the amino acid level (nonstructural protein 55%, capsid coding region 51%). DNA cross hybridization studies indicate an even closer similarity of goose parvovirus to the yet unsequenced human dependoviruses AAV1 and AAV3 than to AAV2. These findings suggest that goose parvovirus may be genetically related to the dependovirus genus rather than to the other autonomous parvoviruses.

To prepare a comprehensive table of lipids and fatty acids in foods, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has has conducted an intensive survey of the world's literature published since 1960. Examination of an extensive number of reports on the fatty acid composition of the lipids of eggs of the domestic hen shows the composition to be relatively stable and subject to alteration only by major changes in dietary fat. Large eggs contain more lipid and fatty acids on a per-egg basis than do small eggs. Complete extraction of bound lipid in egg yolk is necessary for quantification of lipid classes and cannot be achieved with apolar solvents. Lipid class compositional studies indicate that 83 percent of total egg lipids are fatty acids. This percentage figure provides the basis for converting fatty acid data expressed as weight per cent methyl esters to the gram-per-100-gm,-food basis used in nutrient tables. Reliable, up-to-date tabulations of total lipids and fatty acids in eggs of different species and egg products are presented.

Six types of salted fish and 10 other sorts of salted food products traditionally consumed by southern Chinese were analysed by GC-MS for the presence of volatile nitrosamines. The detection limit in the original raw food was 1 microg/kg for each nitrosamine. Only NDMA, in the range of 1-35 microg/kg, could be detected, in four of the six types of salted fish samples examined; and no nitrosamines were found in the other salted food products.

Fecal DNA metabarcoding is currently used in various fields of ecology to determine animal diets. Contamination of non-food DNA from complex field environments is a considerable challenge to the reliability of this method but has rarely been quantified. We evaluated plant DNA contamination by sequencing the chloroplast trnL P6 loop region from food-controlled geese feces. The average percentage of contaminant sequences per sample was 1.86%. According to the results of generalized linear models, the probability of contamination was highest in samples placed in wet soil. The proportion of contaminant sequences was lowest at the earliest sampling point and was slightly higher in samples placed in open conditions. Exclusion of rare OTUs (operational taxonomic units) was effective for obtaining reliable dietary data from the obtained sequences, and a 1% cutoff reduced the percentage of contaminated samples to less than 30%. However, appropriate interpretation of the barcoding results considering inevitable contamination is an important issue to address. We suggest the following procedures for fecal sampling and sequence data treatment to increase the reliability of DNA metabarcoding diet analyses: (i) Collect samples as soon as possible after deposition, (ii) avoid samples from deposits on wet soil, and (iii) exclude rare OTUs from diet composition estimations.

Pasteurella multocida serotyping results were compiled and reported for 1971-1973. A total of 762 isolations from 20 different animal species from 23 states were serotyped. Serotype 3 was most common, accounting for 53% of the isolations.

The sightings and migration patterns of 65 bean (Anser fabalis) and 65 white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons) are reported. In the past, these geese were serologically screened for the occurrence of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and other avian viral diseases by Hlinak et al. (3). Of the 130 birds originally tagged and serologically screened in 1991, 53 birds were resighted between 1991 and 1996. Most of the sightings were reported from main wintering and resting sites in Germany and The Netherlands. It is noteworthy that 19 of the 53 birds sighted had serologic evidence that they had been exposed to NDV before the time of marking in 1991. Although the origin of these infections in bean geese and white-fronted geese is still unknown, the sightings reported in this study indicate that, once infected, wild geese may be involved in the dissemination and spread of avian viral diseases, specifically Newcastle disease. The migration patterns of the wild geese provided further evidence that the main resting and wintering areas of migratory waterfowl are likely to be important for the inter- and intraspecies transmission of avian diseases, thereby representing risk areas for the poultry industry.

A previous study demonstrated that a dietary treatment of young geese with cholesterol and cholic acid raises lipid concentrations in the liver. The present study was carried out to investigate whether such a lipid accumulation caused by those hyperlipidemic compounds can be intensified by low dietary choline concentrations. Therefore, 38 eight-week old geese were divided into four groups of 9 or 10 animals each and received a basal diet poor in choline which consisted predominately of maize and soy protein isolate over a period of 8 weeks. Treatment factors were supplementation of diets with cholesterol and cholic acid (0 vs. 5 g of cholesterol and cholic acid each per kg) and supplementation of choline chloride (0 vs. 1.5 g/kg). Final body weights as well as carcass weights were neither influenced significantly by dietary treatment with cholesterol and cholic acid nor by low dietary choline concentrations. However, feeding diets supplemented with cholesterol and cholic acid markedly increased liver weights (two-fold), hepatic triglyceride (3.7-fold) and cholesterol (12-fold) concentrations and percentages of monounsaturated fatty acids at the expense of saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids in the liver. In geese fed diets with cholesterol and cholic acid, insufficient choline supply did not intensify, but even slightly reduced hepatic lipid accumulation. Geese fed diets with cholesterol and cholic acid exhibited markedly increased levels of cholesterol, triglycerides and phospholipids in plasma and very low-density lipoproteins, regardless of the choline supply. Muscle tissue of geese fed diets supplemented with cholesterol and cholic acid exhibited also increased concentrations of triglycerides and cholesterol whereas the fatty acid composition of muscle lipids remained unchanged. Among geese without hyperlipidemic treatment, concentrations of triglycerides in plasma and very low-density lipoproteins as well as the concentrations of phosphatidylcholine in liver and muscle tissue were not reduced by low dietary choline concentrations. Therefore, it is suggested that those animals were able to synthesize endogenous sufficient choline.

Both merogonic and gamogonic stages of Eimeria hermani occurred within the nucleus of epithelial cells of the intestine of experimentally infected goslings (Anser anser domesticus L.). They were located within a parasitophorous vacuole. Several developing meronts were often observed in one host nucleus and each of them had its own parasitophorous vacuole. We suppose that two generations of meronts were formed by ectomerogony from 2 to 4 days post infection (DPI). During the gamogony (4-6 DPI), we observed invagination of the host cell nucleoplasm into the parasites and we suppose that this may be connected with the process of the parasite's feeding.

The duck (Anas platyrhynchos) is one of the principal natural hosts of influenza A viruses. We present the duck genome sequence and perform deep transcriptome analyses to investigate immune-related genes. Our data indicate that the duck possesses a contractive immune gene repertoire, as in chicken and zebra finch, and this repertoire has been shaped through lineage-specific duplications. We identify genes that are responsive to influenza A viruses using the lung transcriptomes of control ducks and ones that were infected with either a highly pathogenic (A/duck/Hubei/49/05) or a weakly pathogenic (A/goose/Hubei/65/05) H5N1 virus. Further, we show how the duck's defense mechanisms against influenza infection have been optimized through the diversification of its β-defensin and butyrophilin-like repertoires. These analyses, in combination with the genomic and transcriptomic data, provide a resource for characterizing the interaction between host and influenza viruses.

The experiment comprised of 50 chickens, 40 ducks and 30 geese fed a diet containing 40% barley. Birds were kept in metabolic cages from 1 to 42 days of age. A balance trial was carried out during the last week of the bird's life and the apparent digestibility of nutrients was determined. At 21 and 42 days of age 12 animals per species were killed. The absolute length of intestines followed the live weight (LW) of the animals. In relation to metabolic LW (kg(0.67)), the total length was significantly higher in chickens and geese than in ducks at 21 days of age, but identical in the three species at 42 days of age. The absolute and relative weights of intestines were smaller in ducks than in chickens and geese both at 21 and 42 days of age. Dietary fibre was digested better by chickens than by ducks and geese (P<0.01). Ileal digestibility of total amino acids amounted to 76% in chickens, 69% in ducks (P>0.05) and only 56% in geese (P<0.01) with relatively low digestibility of methionine (70, 44 and 52%) and lysine (72, 57 and 41%), respectively. The overall tract-faecal digestibility of total amino acids was evaluated on the level of 86% for all three species and indicates a substantial hind gut synthesis of amino acids.

Biomineralization is an important process in which hard tissues are generated through mineral deposition, often assisted by biomacromolecules. Eggshells, because of their rapid formation via mineralization, are chosen as a model for understanding the fundamentals of biomineralization. This report discusses purification and characterization of various proteins and peptides from goose eggshell matrix. A novel 15-kDa protein (ansocalcin) was extracted from the eggshell matrix, purified, and identified and its role in mineralization evaluated using in vitro crystal growth experiments. The complete amino acid sequence of ansocalcin showed high homology to ovocleidin-17, a chicken eggshell protein, and to C-type lectins from snake venom. The amino acid sequence of ansocalcin was characterized by the presence of acidic and basic amino acid multiplets. In vitro crystallization experiments showed that ansocalcin induced pits on the rhombohedral faces at lower concentrations (<50 microg/ml). At higher concentrations, the nucleation of calcite crystal aggregates was observed. Molecular weight determinations by size exclusion chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed reversible concentration-dependent aggregation of ansocalcin in solution. We propose that such aggregated structures may act as a template for the nucleation of calcite crystal aggregates. Similar aggregation of calcite crystals was also observed when crystallizations were performed in the presence of whole goose eggshell extract. These results show that ansocalcin plays a significant role in goose eggshell calcification.

While the spatial pattern of the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus has been studied throughout Southeast Asia, little is known on the spatial risk factors for avian influenza in Africa. In the present paper, we combined serological data from poultry and remotely sensed environmental factors in the Lake Alaotra region of Madagascar to explore for any association between avian influenza and landscape variables. Serological data from cross-sectional surveys carried out on poultry in 2008 and 2009 were examined together with a Landsat 7 satellite image analysed using supervised classification. The dominant landscape features in a 1-km buffer around farmhouses and distance to the closest water body were extracted. A total of 1,038 individual bird blood samples emanating from 241 flocks were analysed, and the association between avian influenza seroprevalence and these landcape variables was quantified using logistic regression models. No evidence of the presence of H5 or H7 avian influenza subtypes was found, suggesting that only low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) circulated. Three predominant land cover classes were identified around the poultry farms: grassland savannah, rice paddy fields and wetlands. A significant negative relationship was found between LPAI seroprevalence and distance to the closest body of water. We also found that LPAI seroprevalence was higher in farms characterised by predominant wetlands or rice landscapes than in those surrounded by dry savannah. Results from this study suggest that if highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus were introduced in Madagascar, the environmental conditions that prevail in Lake Alaotra region may allow the virus to spread and persist.

Tuberculosis was detected in seven geese at the breeding unit of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Kafkas University, during 1998. In the necropsy, lesions of nodular type were seen in the liver, spleen, and lungs. Histopathologically, the lesions were characterized by central areas of caseous necrosis surrounded by epithelioid cells, multinucleated giant cells, lymphocytes, and an outer fibrous capsule. Acid-fast bacilli were visualized by the Ziehl-Neelsen staining method in paraffin sections and smears. Inoculation into Lowenstein-Jensen media with glycerin yielded Mycobacterium spp.

Induction of the innate immune pathways is critical for early anti-viral defense. How geese recognize viral molecules and activate these pathways is not well understood. In mammals, Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) recognizes double-stranded RNA. Activation of TLR3 induces the activation of NF-кB and the production of type-I interferon. In this study, the goose TLR3 gene was cloned using rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Goose TLR3 encoded an 896-amino-acid protein, containing a signal secretion peptide, 14 extracellular leucine-rich repeat domains, a transmembrane domain, a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor signaling domain, and shared 46.7-84.4% homology with other species. Tissue expression of goose TLR3 varied markedly and was highest in the pancreas and lowest in the skin. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with goose TLR3 and NF-κB-luciferase-containing plasmids responded significantly to poly i:c. The expression of TLR3, IL-6 and IFN-γ mRNA, but not IL-1 mRNA, was significantly upregulated after poly i:c or high pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1) stimulation in goose peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultured in vitro. Furthermore, geese infected with H5N1 showed significant upregulation of TLR3, especially in the lung and brain. We conclude that goose TLR3 is a functional TLR3 homologue of the protein in other species and plays an important role in virus recognition.

Semen of Greylag (Anser anser L.) ganders was frozen according to a method previously elaborated by the authors for freezing the White Koluda gander semen. Semen was collected from five to eight Greylag ganders, twice a week during three succeeding reproductive cycles, by dorso-abdominal massage. Semen samples were diluted in the ratio of 1:1 or 2:1 (two parts semen: one part diluent) with EK diluent, supplemented by 6% DMF, equilibrated and pre-frozen to -140 degrees C at a rate 60 degrees C/min, before being transferred into liquid nitrogen container. Semen samples thawed in a water bath of 60 degrees C were used for twice a week insemination in a volume of 200 microl. Three Greylag and three White Koluda geese were involved in frozen-thawed semen fertilizing ability test. The reproductive cycle of wild geese lasts usually about 6-7 weeks. The ejaculate volume (30-140 microl) and sperm concentration (10x10(6) to 150x10(6) ml(-1)) are much lower than these of domestic ganders, but spermatozoa morphology is similar, particularly while compared to 1-year-old White Koluda ganders semen. There are about 90% of live spermatozoa and about 30% of live morphologically normal cells in Greylag gander fresh semen. The Greylag gander spermatozoa susceptibility to cryopreservation procedure is as high as in domestic ganders. Dilution ratio 2:1 resulted in higher number of live spermatozoa, which withstood cryoinjury stress. In relation to fresh semen about 60% of spermatozoa remained intact (on the basis of light microscope examination) in the frozen-thawed semen. Insemination of frozen-thawed semen resulted in 37.5% of fertile eggs in Greylag and 25.0% in White Koluda geese. Low fertility rate was caused by an insufficient number of live normal spermatozoa used for insemination (about three million in every dose).

Thyroid hormones show fluctuating levels during the post-hatching development of birds. In this paper we report the results of the first mechanical tests to quantify the effect of hypothyroidism, during post-natal development, on the skeletal properties of a precocial bird, the barnacle goose, as determined by microhardness testing. The effect of hypothyroidism is tissue-specific; bone from the femora of birds is not significantly affected by induced hypothyroidism, however, there is a strong positive relationship between the levels of circulating thyroid hormones and the mechanical properties of bone from humeri. In the barnacle goose the development of the wing skeleton and musculature depends on an increase in circulating thyroid hormones and our analysis shows that, in its absence, the mechanical competence of the bone mineral itself is reduced in addition to the decreased bone length and muscle development previously reported in the literature.

A novel goose immunoglobulin υ chain (Igυ) Fc fragment gene was cloned from splenic tissue mRNA using RT-PCR. Deduced amino acid sequence data from different vertebrates revealed high similarity to IgY-Fc fragments of duck (91%) and chicken (64%). Molecular characterization showed that the goose IgY-Fc fragment was consistent with the definition of immunoglobulin, and had the same antigenicity to natural IgY. Flow cytometry and laser scanning confocal microscopy showed that the polyclonal antibody against GoυFc reacted with the membrane surface of B lymphocytes in peripheral blood, which indicates that IgY was expressed on the surface of B cells. Analyses of the gene sequence of the goose IgY-Fc fragment and expression of B cell membrane may provide insight into the evolution of the Ig heavy chain gene family and benefit future studies on the avian immune system.

The diseases associated with psittacine beak and feather disease virus (BFDV), pigeon circovirus (PiCV) and goose circovirus (GoCV), which can be classified with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) as members of the genus Circovirus of the family Circoviridae, have clinico-pathological features in common with post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), with which PCV2 infection is causally associated. Intracytoplasmic botryoid inclusions within macrophages and depletion of T and B lymphocytes are common histopathological features, and, in each case, affected animals usually exhibit ill-thrift and a predisposition to secondary infections, that is suggestive of an underlying immunosuppression. Although these avian diseases have been the subjects of relatively little research, their study can provide directly applicable lessons in the areas of diagnosis, epidemiology, pathogenesis and disease control for those charged with investigating PMWS. In keeping with its taxonomic separation as the only member of the genus Gyrovirus, the disease caused by chicken anaemia virus (CAV) differs histopathologically from the other circovirus-associated diseases. Most notably, the target cells of CAV have been identified as haemocytoblasts and precursor T lymphocytes, with lymphocyte depletion, which affects T cells only, occurring in cells directly infected with the virus. Nonetheless, CAV is the best-researched circovirus and provides excellent examples of both virus-induced immunosuppression and virus-virus interactions. The study of CAV-induced disease can therefore provide valuable, if less directly applicable lessons.

Eighteen-day-old domestic geese (Anser anser f. domestica) and 3-week-old Canada geese (Branta canadensis) were experimentally infected with 10(6) EID50/bird of H5N1 high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) virus isolates belonging to clades 1 and 2.2. Clinical signs were observed in all of the groups and included listlessness, inappetence, marked incoordination, torticollis, paralysis and lethargy. Mortality reached 100% (Canada geese) and 40-50% (domestic geese). During necropsy, congestion and hemorrhagic lesions were most often observed. Histopathological lesions were located in multiple organs and included inflammatory and hemorrhagic changes and, in later stages, occurrences of necrosis. All of the tested organ samples collected between 3 and 8 days PI were found positive in rRT-PCR, but the highest concentration of RNA was found in the brain. The observed delayed onset of mortality and prolonged duration of the disease in young domestic geese may be related to numerous host and virus factors.

H5N1 avian influenza virus (AIV) has emerged as a pathogenic entity for a variety of species, including humans, in recent years. Here we report an outbreak among migratory birds on Lake Qinghaihu, China, in May and June 2005, in which more than a thousand birds were affected. Pancreatic necrosis and abnormal neurological symptoms were the major clinical features. Sequencing of the complete genomes of four H5N1 AIV strains revealed them to be reassortants related to a peregrine falcon isolate from Hong Kong and to have known highly pathogenic characteristics. Experimental animal infections reproduced typical highly pathogenic AIV infection symptoms and pathology.

Wild birds are important in the epidemiology of toxoplasmosis because they can serve as reservoir hosts, and vectors of zoonotic pathogens including Toxoplasma gondii. Canada goose (Branta canadensis) is the most widespread geese in North America. Little is known concerning T. gondii infection in both migratory, and local resident populations of Canada geese. Here, we evaluated the seroprevalence, isolation, and genetic characterization of viable T. gondii isolates from a migratory population of Canada geese. Antibodies against T. gondii were detected in 12 of 169 Canada geese using the modified agglutination test (MAT, cutoff 1:25). The hearts of 12 seropositive geese were bioassayed in mice for isolation of T. gondii. Viable parasites were isolated from eight. One isolate was obtained from a seropositive goose by both bioassays in mice, and in a cat; the cat fed infected heart excreted T. gondii oocysts. Additionally, one isolate was obtained from a pool of four seronegative (<1:25) geese by bioassay in a cat. The T. gondii isolates were further propagated in cell culture, and DNA extracted from cell culture-derived tachyzoites were characterized using 10 polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) genetic markers (SAG1, 5' and 3'SAG2, alt.SAG2, SAG3, BTUB, GRA6, c22-8, c29-2, L358, PK1, and Apico). The results revealed five different genotypes. ToxoDB PCR-RFLP genotype #1 (type II) in one isolate, genotype #2 (type III) in four isolates, genotype #4 in two isolates, and two new genotypes (ToxoDB PCR-RFLP genotype #266 in one isolate and #267 in one isolate) were identified. These results indicate genetic diversity of T. gondii strains in the Canada geese, and this migratory bird might provide a mechanism of T. gondii transmission at great distances from where an infection was acquired.

Gut microbial ecology is responsible for fatty acid metabolism in ruminants. The cecal microbiota composition of geese and their adaptation to fiber inclusion and feeding timeswere investigated in this study. A total of 116 Wanxi white geese were randomly selected at 70 days old. Eight geese were subjected to cecal sampling at 70 d of age, and the remaining 108 geese were divided into four groups with three replicates each (9 geese in each replicate). The geese in the four groups were fed 0, 15, 30, and 45% green forage (relative to dry matter), respectively. Three birds from each replicate were selected for cecal sampling at 80, 90, and 100 days old. All samples were subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing using the Illumina Ion Personal Genome Machine platform. Bacterial abundance was analyzed using two-way ANOVA analysis, and the relationship between the relative abundance of bacteria (phylum level) and fatty acids was analyzed using acanonical correspondence analysis. Cecal microbiota in geese were mainly composed of Bacteroidetes (68.46%), Firmicutes (20.04%), and Proteobacteria (7.89%). Dietary treatments had no significant effect on the α-diversity indices of the cecal bacterial community (P > 0.05), but a numerical increase occurred with increased fattening duration and green forage inclusion. The Selenomonadales order (P = 0.024), Negativicutes class (P = 0.026), and Megamonas (P = 0.012) and Oscillospira (P = 0.042) genera were affected by green forageinclusion level, and microflora abundance was mainly influenced by the fattening duration. Bacteria phyla were mostly set along the line of linolenic acid and oleic acid. Finally, Bacteroidales might be an intestinal promoter that improves unsaturated fatty acid synthesis in geese.

Birds clean and lubricate their feathers with waxes that are produced in the uropygial gland, a holocrine gland located on their back above the tail. The type and the composition of the secreted wax esters are dependent on the bird species, for instance the wax ester secretion of goose contains branched-chain fatty acids and unbranched fatty alcohols, whereas that of barn owl contains fatty acids and alcohols both of which are branched. Alcohol-forming fatty acyl-CoA reductases (FAR) catalyze the reduction of activated acyl groups to fatty alcohols that can be esterified with acyl-CoA thioesters forming wax esters.

Cell-free extracts from the uropygial gland of goose catalyzed the incorporation of malonyl-CoA into normal fatty acids and methylmalonyl-CoA into multimethyl branched acids with NADPH as the preferred reductant (J. S. Buckner and P.E. Kolattukudy (1975), Biochemistry 14, 1771). Purification of fatty acid synthetase from this extract was accomplished in one step by gel filtration with Sepharose 4B. Homogeneity of the fatty acid synthetase was shown by analytical ultracentrifugation, immunodiffusion assays, polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis, and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis. At a pH of 7.0, apparent Km values of 3.6 X 10(-5) M and 1.5 X 10(-5) M were calculated for malonyl-C0A and NADPH, respectively. The major products synthesized by the enzyme from malonyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-C0A were free hexadecanoic acid and free 2, 4, 6, 8-tetramethyldecanoic acid, respectively, with acetyl-CoA as primer. A molecular weight value of 547 000 was determined for the goose fatty acid synthetase by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation. The purified enzyme had an s20,w of 13.5S and was partially dissociated in low-ionic strength buffer into a 9.3S species, and this dissociation was accompanied by a corresponding partial inactivation of the enzymatic activity. Reassociation and reactivation of the partially dissociated fatty acid synthetase were accomplished in either 0.2 M KCl or 200 muM NADPH. These properties of the goose enzyme are similar to those of other animal fatty acid synthetases, as was the amino acid composition. Dissociation of the purified enzyme with sodium dodecyl sulfate resulted in only two equal molecular weight polypeptides (269 000), as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis. Injection of labeled pantothenic acid into the uropygial gland resulted in the synthesis of labeled fatty acid synthetase in which the label appeared to be located exclusively in the 4'-phosphopantotheine moiety. Analysis of the labeled enzyme by gel filtration and polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate showed that the labeled pantothenate was contained exclusively in the half molecular weight moiety. The enzyme contained one 4'-phosphopantetheine residue per subunit (269 000), as determined by measurement of the taurine generated by hydrolysis of performic acid-treated enzyme. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-activated proteolytic activity was shown to be associated with goose fatty acid synthetase, and this proteolysis was shown to result in the formation of small-molecular-weight protein fragments (less than 200 000) during treatment of the enzyme with sodium dodecyl sulfate. This proteolysis could be prevented by diisopropyl fluorophosphate and p-chloromercuribenzoate. These results strongly suggest that the goose uropygial gland fatty acid synthetase consists of two multifunctional polypeptide subunits, each containing one covalently linked 4'-phosphopantetheine.

Diets containing raw soya-beans (RSD) when fed ad libitum cause reduction in growth rate and food utilization, enlargement of the pancreas and increase of its enzyme synthesis. A single meal of raw soya-beans with corn (1:9), tube-fed to geese, caused about 90% mortality, while geese, tube-fed with corn alone, did not show any negative response. No mortality occurred when geese were fed a similar diet ad libitum. Two-week old chicks were fed ad libitum or by tube, twice a day, similar amounts of RSD or heated soya-bean diet (HSD). While the chicks tube-fed HSD behaved similarly to those feeding freely, the chicks tube-fed RSD collapsed after one week. The thymus and bursa of fabricii were atrophied in the RSD tube-fed chicks. Diets containing increasing amounts of raw soya-bean meal (0,20%, 42%, and 80%) were fed freely to weanling rats or as one 4 h meal per day. All the rats fed the 4 h meal containing either 42% or 80% raw soya-bean meal died within 3 days; all the others survived. The rats were trained to meal-feeding by gradual reduction of their access to food. The negative effects of the RSD, i.e. reduced food intake and body weight gain, pancreas enlargement, were much more pronounced in the meal-fed rats than in those fed ad libitum. The differences increased by increasing dietary trypsin inhibitor (TI) (raw soya-bean meal).

The human cerebral and systemic amyloidoses and prion-associated spongiform encephalopathies are acquired or inherited protein folding disorders in which normally soluble proteins or peptides are converted into fibrillar aggregates. This is a nucleation-dependent process that can be initiated or accelerated by fibril seeds formed from homologous or heterologous amyloidogenic precursors that serve as an amyloid enhancing factor (AEF) and has pathogenic significance in that disease may be transmitted by oral ingestion or parenteral administration of these conformationally altered components. Except for infected brain tissue, specific dietary sources of AEF have not been identified. Here we report that commercially available duck- or goose-derived foie gras contains birefringent congophilic fibrillar material composed of serum amyloid A-related protein that acted as a potent AEF in a transgenic murine model of secondary (amyloid A protein) amyloidosis. When such mice were injected with or fed amyloid extracted from foie gras, the animals developed extensive systemic pathological deposits. These experimental data provide evidence that an amyloid-containing food product hastened the development of amyloid protein A amyloidosis in a susceptible population. On this basis, we posit that this and perhaps other forms of amyloidosis may be transmissible, akin to the infectious nature of prion-related illnesses.

In nature, birds are faced with variable food sources that may differ in composition (protein vs. carbohydrates) and quality (highly digestible material vs. indigestible fiber). Studies in passerine birds and some commercial poultry demonstrate that the gastrointestinal tract can respond to varying diet composition and quality by changing morphology and/or activities of digestive enzymes. However, studies in additional avian species are warranted to understand generalities of these trends. We first fed juvenile mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), chickens (Gallus gallus), and quails (Coturnix coturnix) on either high-carbohydrate or high-protein diets. For the most part, birds fed the high-carbohydrate diet had higher small intestinal and cecal disaccharidase activities (maltase and sucrase). However, only mallards exhibited higher small intestinal aminopeptidase-N (APN) activities when fed the high-protein diet. These results differ from passerine birds, which largely modulate small intestinal proteases, but not disaccharidases. In another trial, we fed Canada geese (Branta canadensis) diets that varied in both their protein and fiber concentrations for approximately 3.5 months. Birds fed the high-fiber diets had significantly longer small intestines and caeca compared to those fed low-fiber diets. Additionally, geese fed the high-fiber diets exhibited lower mass-specific activities of small intestinal sucrase, and higher activities of APN when summed across the small intestine and ceca. Similar to the avian species above, geese fed the high-protein diets did not exhibit flexibility in their small intestinal APN activities. Overall, these experiments demonstrate that responsiveness of the avian digestive tract to diet composition may have phylogenetic or ecological constraints. Studies on other avian taxa are needed to understand these patterns.

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are found in a wide variety of wild and domestic animals, and constitute a risk for zoonotic and emerging infectious disease. In poultry, the genetic diversity, evolution, distribution and taxonomy of some coronaviruses have been well described, but little is known about the features of CoVs in wild birds. In this study we screened 764 samples from 22 avian species of the orders Anseriformes and Charadriiformes in Sweden collected in 2006/2007 for CoV, with an overall CoV prevalence of 18.7%, which is higher than many other wild bird surveys. The highest prevalence was found in the diving ducks--mainly Greater Scaup (Aythya marila; 51.5%)--and the dabbling duck Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos; 19.2%). Sequences from two of the Greater Scaup CoV fell into an infrequently detected lineage, shared only with a Tufted Duck (Aythya fuligula) CoV. Coronavirus sequences from Mallards in this study were highly similar to CoV sequences from the sample species and location in 2011, suggesting long-term maintenance in this population. A single Black-headed Gull represented the only positive sample from the order Charadriiformes. Globally, Anas species represent the largest fraction of avian CoV sequences, and there seems to be no host species, geographical or temporal structure. To better understand the eitiology, epidemiology and ecology of these viruses more systematic surveillance of wild birds and subsequent sequencing of detected CoV is imperative.

Twenty Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strains were isolated from chickens and geese in the field outbreaks during 2005 and 2006 in some regions of Jiangsu and Guangxi province. Assessment of the virulence by MDT and ICPI, RT-PCR and sequence analysis of fusion protein gene were used to compare the properties of NDV isolates. The results indicated that MDT and ICPI of the isolates were 45.3h - 58.2h and 1.61 - 2.00 respectively, which confirmed that the all NDV isolates were highly virulent. And their hemagglutinin were not resistant to heat and belonged to fast pattern of elution. The results of nucleotide sequencing and phylogentic analysis of fusion protein gene showed that the twenty strains shared homology from 79.7% to 100% among themselves, from 78.1% to 83.4% and from 80.2% to 90.1% with NDV LaSota, F48E8, respectively. The putative amino acid sequences of fusion protein at the cleavage sites of all the isolates were 112R-R-Q-R/K-R-F117, with the motif characteristics of the virulent NDV strain, which was in accordant with the results of assessment of the pathogenicity. The phylogentic tree based on sequences of fusion protein gene variable regions (47-420nt) revealed that the 18 strains belonged to sub-genotype VIId and the others belonged to an old genotype III of NDV, revealing that subgenotype VIId virus was responsible for the NDV outbreaks in some regions of Jiangsu and Guangxi promince recently.

Typing of Mycobacterium avium strains obtained in a study of endemic tuberculosis in a Wildfowl Reserve permitted the recognition of two separate infected groups. The main infection was in Anatidae and was due to M. avium, type 1; the other was in chickens used for incubation and brooding and the predominance in it of type 2 agreed with normal experience of birds, pigs and cattle in Britain. Many of the strains isolated from the Anatidae were aberrant and methods used to investigate these are described; two of the strains may belong to a new type. Birds which died from other causes, usually trauma, often had subclinical tuberculosis and 5% of the samples of mud and soil examined yielded M. avium.

Data collected during the velogenic viscerotropic Newcastle disease (VVND) epidemic that occurred in southern California from 1971 to 1973 were analyzed to determine the methods of spread of the disease. Spread between chicken flocks was extensive and due mainly to the movement of live birds and mechanical transport of virus by man, especially by vaccination and poultry service crews. Spread to exotic birds was from contact with infected imported stock. Spread to other species was most probably through contact with infected chickens. Infection persisted in commercial chicken flocks because of intensive vaccination programs, heavy traffic and contact between layer operations, and the maintenance of multi-age flocks. These foci of infection probably led to spread of the disease to areas from which VVND had been eradicated several months before. There was no evidence of significant wind-borne spread of virus between flocks.

To remove circulating harmful small biochemical(s)/substrates causing/deteriorating certain chronic disease, therapeutic enzyme(s) delivered via vein injection/infusion suffer(s) from immunoresponse after repeated administration at proper intervals for a long time and short half-lives since delivery. Accordingly, a novel, generally-applicable extracorporeal delivery of a therapeutic enzyme is proposed, by refitting a conventional hemodialysis device bearing a dialyzer, two pumps and connecting tubes, to build a routine extracorporeal blood circuit but a minimal dialysate circuit closed to circulate the therapeutic enzyme in dialysate. A special quantitative index was derived to reflect pharmacological action and thus pharmacodynamics of the delivered enzyme. With hyperuricemic blood in vitro and hyperuricemic geese, a native uricase via extracorporeal delivery was active in the dialysate for periods much longer than that in vivo through vein injection, and exhibited the expected pharmacodynamics to remove uric acid in hyperuricemic blood in vitro and multiple forms of uric acid in hyperuricemic geese. Therefore, the extracorporeal delivery approach of therapeutic enzymes was effective to remove unwanted circulating small biochemical(s)/substrates, and was expected to avoid immunogenicity problems of therapeutic enzymes after repeated administration at proper intervals for a long time due to no contacts with macromolecules and cells in the body.

Midazolam HCl (1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg of body weight) was administered IM to 6 Canada geese to determine a sedative dose that would allow positioning for radiologic examination. The effects of both test doses on cardiopulmonary function were evaluated at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40 minutes after drug administration and were compared with 2 end-tidal isoflurane concentrations (1.5 and 2.5%). The 2.0 mg/kg dosage induced moderate sedation at 15 and 20 minutes; sedation was adequate for positioning the geese. Sedation induced by the 1.0 mg/kg dosage was inadequate. The effects of both test doses on blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature were not significantly different from each other and from baseline data. Respiratory rate increased significantly (P less than 0.05) at 10, 15, 20, and 30 minutes with the 2.0 mg/kg dosage, and at 15 and 20 minutes with the 1.0 mg/kg dosage. Blood pressure and respiratory rate were significantly (P less than 0.05) decreased with isoflurane when compared with baseline data and the midazolam test doses. The results of this study indicate that midazolam at a dosage of 2.0 mg/kg induces adequate sedation with minimal cardiopulmonary changes, and, as an alternative to general anesthesia with isoflurane, provides a satisfactory level of restraint for radiography.

The domestic poultry population in Vietnam has been vaccinated against highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 since 2005. Since then, outbreaks have continued to occur without a clear understanding of the mechanisms involved. The general objective of this study was to understand the epidemiology of the disease in the context of vaccination and to draw some conclusions about vaccination efficacy in the domestic poultry population of the Red River Delta area. Five cross-sectional surveys to measure the serological and virological prevalence in vaccinated and unvaccinated poultry were performed from the end of 2008 to June 2010. The global seroprevalence was 24% (95% confidence interval 19·9-28·2). Determinants of vaccine immunogenicity were identified separately in chickens and ducks as well as determinants of the seroconversion in unvaccinated birds. The results highlight the difficulties in maintaining good flock immunity in poultry populations using inactivated vaccine in the field with two vaccination rounds per year, and in preventing circulation of virus in co-existing unvaccinated poultry.

Goose red blood cells were studied as a model for metabolic regulation of sugar transport. In contrast to their action in human erythrocytes, sulfhydryl-blocking agents such as N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) stimulated 3-O-methylglucose transport markedly in goose red blood cells. The effect of NEM was further enhanced when adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) was first depleted by 2,4-dinitrophenol treatment or anoxia. Only sulfhydryl-blocking agents that enter the cell were effective transport stimulators, and the effect was not altered by substrates of the transporter. In nucleated red blood cell ghosts, NEM inhibited 3-O-methylglucose transport. Results of these studies with intact cells were consistent with the hypothesis that free sulfhydryl groups are essential for regulation of transporter activity rather than for the transport process itself. The locus of NEM action appears to be either on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane or partially located in the cytoplasm. ATP depletion may expose previously masked sulfhydryl groups, producing an enhanced reaction with sulfhydryl-blocking agents and a highly stimulated rate of sugar transport.

The companion article (Sholomenko et al. 1991) described the brainstem locomoter regions in the bird where direct intracerebral injection of a number of putative excitatory neurochemicals, including cholinergic agonists, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and Substance P, evoke locomotion. Using the same experimental protocol, this study focuses on the locomotor effects following discrete brainstem injections of the inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and some of GABA agonists and antagonists. Brainstem regions that were electrically and chemically stimulated included the ventromedial medullary reticular formation, the pontobulbar locomotor strip of the dorsolateral pons and medulla, the pontine reticular formation, and the mesencephalic reticular formation. Locomotion was evoked after the injection of the GABA antagonists picrotoxin (a GABAA receptor antagonist) and bicuculline (GABAA antagonist) into several brainstem locomoter regions. Brainstem stimulated locomotion (both chemically and electrically induced) could be transiently blocked by intracerebral infusion of GABA and irreversibly blocked by muscimol (GABAA agonist). Our avian results are similar to those described for mammals and provide support for the suggestion that motor circuitry, at least at brainstem levels, is similar in all vertebrates.

Blood samples were taken from adult male and female geese, and from gonadectomized (GX), thyroidectomized (TX) and gonadectomized+thyroidectomized (GX+TX) ones during the reproduction peak period (March 16), at the beginning of photorefractoriness (June 14), in the second half of the photorefractory period (August 14), and at the beginning of the postrefractory period (October 2). Surgeries were carried out at the age of 10-13 weeks. The birds were kept under natural light conditions. From the blood plasma prolactin (PRL), luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone (T), progesterone (P4), 17 beta-oestradiol (E2) as well as thyroxine (T4) and triiodo-tironine (T3) were determined by RIA methods. At the beginning of photorefractoriness in intact geese the LH and E2 levels significantly decrease, relative to sexually active period, whereas the P4 remains at a high level. In ganders the LH shows only a slight decrease but the T level is significantly lower than in spring. The PRL, T4 and T3 levels increase after reproduction and give a peak value in both sexes. In both GX ganders and geese decreased T, P4 and T3 levels are observable and the PRL is decreased in females, and the LH is increased in both sexes. Gonadectomy does not influence the E2 in females, the PRL in males and the T4 in both sexes. In TX birds the PRL is higher in March and lower in June than the control level, but these changes are significant only in females. In TX females the P4 level is lower during reproduction and at the beginning of photorefractoriness. The T and E2 levels do not change during the photorefractoriness. In the second half of photorefractoriness a low PRL and P4 level, an increasing LH, T and medium high T4 and T3 levels characterized the intact male and female geese. In GX animals an increase of LH levels is occurred in both sexes. The T4 is higher in castrated-, and lower in ovarectomized geese. In TX birds the P4 is higher than in controls, but the difference is significant only in males. The levels of PRL, LH, T and E2 remain unchanged in TX animals. At the beginning of the postrefractory phase the T (in males) and the P4 and the T4 level increase in both sexes. The PRL and LH show a low value. In GX animals the high LH level refer to the increased sensitivity of hypothalamo-gonadotropic system, because of the absence of negative feed-back of sexual steroids.4+ in both sexes and a high thyroid hormone level and a transitional slight reactivation of gonadotropic-gonadal system occur then.

Haemorrhagic nephritis enteritis of geese (HNEG) is a fatal disease of geese aged from 3 to 12 weeks. The causative virus, Goose haemorrhagic polyomavirus (GHPV), is a member of the Polyomaviridae family We examined goslings either spontaneously or experimentally infected with GHPV. Tissues were sampled for histology, GHPV DNA detection and electron microscopy. Clinical signs and gross lesions observed in experimentally infected goslings were largely consistent with those noticed in field cases. Histological examination showed that, in the acute phase of HNEG, GHPV replicates in almost all the tissues with a particular tropism for endothelial and lymphoid cells. Haemorrhagic foci were widespread in many tissues, including brain. Ultrastructural features were largely consistent with other polyomavirus infections, with accumulation of virions in the nucleus. Non-typical, double-membraned organelles were observed in the cytoplasm. GHPV DNA distribution was widespread in tissues of infected birds, from day 5 post-infection. GHPV therefore induces a systemic disease in its host, leading to severe vascular dysfunction and immunosuppressive B-cell depletion.

An investigation into the extent and significance of Pasteurella multocida infections of birds and poultry in Britain during a three year period (1974--1977) was undertaken. This was achieved by means of postal questionnaires, coupled with the biochemical and serological examination of bacterial isolates from 91 outbreaks in poultry and from nine cases in other avian species.

Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is the pivotal enzyme in the de novo synthesis of fatty acids and is the only carboxylase with a biotin-containing subunit greater than 200,000 daltons. The biotin moiety is covalently linked to the active site and has a high affinity (Kd = 10(-15) M) for the protein avidin. This relationship has been used in previous studies to identify acetyl-CoA carboxylase isolated from mammalian species. However, acetyl-CoA carboxylase has not been isolated and characterized in a poikilothermic species such as the rainbow trout. The present study describes the isolation and identification of acetyl-CoA carboxylase in the cytosol of rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) liver. The enzyme was isolated using two distinct procedures--polyethylene glycol precipitation and avidin-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Identification of the isolated protein as acetyl-CoA carboxylase was made by the following: (1) sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; (2) avidin binding; (3) in vivo labeling with [14C]biotin; and (4) acetyl-CoA carboxylase-specific activity. The subunit molecular weight of the major protein was 230,000 daltons +/- 3.3%. This protein was shown to bind avidin (Mr = 16,600) prior to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, indicating the presence of biotin. In addition, protein isolated from fish that had previously received intraperitoneal injections of [14C]biotin, showed the majority of radioactivity associated with the 230,000 dalton protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).

A total of 119 fresh faecal samples were collected from graylag geese migrating northwards in April. Also, cloacal swabs were taken from 100 carcasses of graylag geese shot during the hunting season in August. In addition, samples were taken from 200 feral pigeons and five mallards. The cultivation of bacteria detected Campylobacter jejuni jejuni in six of the pigeons, and in one of the mallards. Salmonella diarizona 14: k: z53 was detected in one graylag goose, while all pigeons and mallards were negative for salmonellae. No avian paramyxovirus was found in any of the samples tested. One mallard, from an Oslo river, was influenza A virus positive, confirmed by RT-PCR and by inoculation of embryonated eggs. The isolate termed A/Duck/Norway/ 1/03 was found to be of H3N8 type based on sequence analyses of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase segments, and serological tests. This is the first time an avian influenza virus has been isolated in Norway. The study demonstrates that the wild bird species examined may constitute a reservoir for important bird pathogens and zoonotic agents in Norway.

Lymnaea elodes snails collected in northern Indiana, U.S.A., were infected with larval stages of an echinostome bearing 37 collar spines and resembling members of the Echinostoma group. The taxonomic status of this digenean was determined through experimental infections of various definitive and first-intermediate hosts. In addition, characteristics of the penetration and paraesophageal glands in cercariae from this echinostomatid were compared with those from E. revolutum and E. trivolvis. Results indicate that this recently discovered 37-collar-spined echinostome parasitizing lymnaeid snails is E. revolutum, making this the first clear report of this trematode in North America.

Fatty acid synthase from the uropygial gland of goose was inhibited by treatment with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate by selectively modifying a lysine residue at the NADPH binding site of the enoyl reductase domain (A. J. Poulose and P. E. Kolattukudy (1980) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 201, 313-321). Distribution of radioactivity in tryptic peptides generated from the synthase treated with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate/NaB3H4 in the presence and absence of 2'-monophosphoadenosine-5'-diphosphoribose, which protects the enzyme from inactivation by pyridoxal phosphate, showed that modification of one specific peptide was prevented by the protector. This peptide was purified by a combination of Sephadex G-25 column chromatography, anion-exchange chromatography, and high-performance liquid chromatography. The primary structure of this peptide is Val-Phe-Thr-Thr-Val-Gly-Ser-Ala-Glu-Lys(Pxy)-Arg.

The amino acid sequence of Egyptian goose lysozyme (EGL) from egg-white and its enzymatic properties were analyzed. The established sequence had the highest similarity to wood duck lysozyme (WDL) with five amino acid substitutions, and had eighteen substitutions difference from hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL). Tyr34 and Gly37 were found at subsites E and F of the active site when compared with HEL. The experimental time-course characteristics of EGL against the N-acetylglucosamine pentamer substrate, (GlcNAc)(5), revealed higher production of (GlcNAc)(4) and lower production of (GlcNAc)(2) when compared with HEL. The saccharide-binding ability of subsites A-C in EGL was also found to be weaker than in HEL. An analysis of the enzymatic reactions of five mutants in respect of positions 34, 37 and 71 in HEL indicated the time-course characteristics of EGL to be caused by the combination of three substitutions (F34Y, N37G and G71R) between HEL and EGL. A computer simulation of the EGL-catalyzed reaction suggested that the time-course characteristics of EGL resulted from the difference in the binding free energy for subsites A, B, E and F and the rate constant of transglycosylation between EGL and HEL.

Satietin, a 50 000 dalton anorectic glycoprotein, was isolated from human serum. Its isoelectric point is 7.0. It contains 14-15% amino acids and 70-75% carbohydrates. Its biological activity survives digestion with proteases and boiling. Satietin is a highly potent anorectic substance. The intracerebroventricular administration of 10-20 micrograms satietin suppresses food intake in rats during the first day of feeding after deprivation of food for 96 h to half of the amount eaten by untreated controls (ID50). The onset of the effect can be detected within 30 min, the peak effect is reached within an hour. The effect lasts 24-30 h. Satietin acts both at intravenous and subcutaneous administration (ID50 = 0.5-0.75 mg/kg) to rats deprived of food for 96 h. The peak effect is reached within an hour and lasts over 24 h. In contrast to the anorectic drugs in clinical use and to the endogenous anorectic substances (like cholecystokinin and calcitonin), satietin proved to be highly selective in suppressing food intake. Considering that satietin is widely distributed in the world of vertebrates, its concentration in the blood is amazingly high, its site of effect is in the central nervous system and it induces satiety without having any other detectable central or peripheral effect, the hypothesis was put forward that satietin may play the role of a rate limiting blood-borne satiety signal in the negative feed-back of food intake, i.e. serving as the essential chemical link connecting the gastrointestinal tract and the brain in the regulation of feeding.

BALB/c mice were immunized with formalin-treated influenza A/CK/Hubei/327/2004 virus. Six monoclonal antibodies specific to HA were selected, designed 1H8, 1D11, 2B7, 2C9, 2H4 and 4C9, respectively. The six Mabs probed linear epitopes by western blot assays. In ELISA additivity assays, the low additivity indexes (< or =28.3) of each pair Mabs indicated that the epitopes recognized by the six Mabs were located on the globular head of HA1. The neutralization activity of anti-HA1 Mabs and chicken polyclonal sera to various AIV H5N1 strains from different hosts was followed by virus neutralization with MDCK cells. All Mabs except 2C9 and chicken polyclonal serum showed highest neutralizing activity to lowly virulent A/Duck/XF/XFY/2004 from different phylogenetic lineage, and lowest neutralization efficiency to highly virulent A/CK/XF/XFJ/2004. For the other two highly virulent viruses, 1D11, 2H4, 4C9 and chicken polyclonal sera had higher neutralization to A/Goose/ZF/ZFE/2004 than A/CK/Hubei/327/2004, and 1H8 and 2B7 had considerable level of neutralizing efficiency to them. These findings suggested that the neutralizing antibodies showed lower neutralization efficiency to highly virulent virus strains than lowly virulent virus strains and strong cross-neutralizing reaction between virus strains located in different phylogenetic lineages. Moreover, the neutralizing Mabs could more efficiently neutralize AIV H5N1 strains from the natural hosts generally, such as waterfowl.

Identifying the temporal and spatial characteristics of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks is very important for developing effective and appropriate countermeasures against HPAI and promoting sustainable development in the poultry industry. This study aimed to analyze four aspects of the temporal and spatial characteristics of HPAI outbreaks in China, including the frequency of HPAI outbreaks, numbers of dead animals (died or culled), types of HPAI viruses, and species of infected animals. Temporal characteristics showed that the frequency of HPAI outbreaks decreased and then increased, with some years deviating from the main trend in 2004 to 2010 and 2011 to 2015, while the largest number of dead animals due to HPAI outbreaks was in 2005. During 2004 to 2015, HPAI H5N1 was the major type of HPAI virus, and chickens had the greatest risk of being infected with HPAI, followed by ducks and geese. The HPAI outbreaks had obvious seasonal effects clustered in January to February, June, and November. Spatial characteristics revealed that outbreaks were more frequent in Xinjiang, Hubei, and Guangdong but caused a larger number of dead animals in Liaoning and Shanxi. HPAI H5N1 appeared in 25 provinces, while HPAI H5N2 was mainly localized in Hebei and Jiangsu, and HPAI H5N6 occurred in Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, Hunan, and Guangdong. HPAI viruses were most frequently detected in chickens and wild birds in northern China, while the majority of HPAI infections were identified in chickens, ducks, and geese in southern China. Regionally, HPAI outbreaks were most frequent in the western region but resulted in larger number of animals dying or being culled in the eastern region. These findings could provide a new understanding of the distributional characteristics of HPAI outbreaks and offer prospects for better prevention and control strategies.

Phorbol esters inhibited the uptake of a fluorescent glucose analogue in goose but not in human erythrocytes. Specific phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDB) binding sites were identified in both goose and human erythrocytes. In the absence of Ca2+ and phospholipid, PDB binding in whole cell lysates was similar to that in intact cells, but addition of Ca2+ (0.5 mM) and phosphatidyl serine (96 micrograms/ml) caused a 4-fold increase in the binding detected in lysates. Nonlinear least-squares analysis of the PDB binding isotherm revealed that the data for lysates from both goose and human cells were best fit by a two-site model, with goose erythrocytes having approximately 3 times as many sites per class of receptors. Subcellular fractionation of human lysates indicated that the high (Kd = 3.6 +/- 2.2 nM) and low (Kd = 20 +/- 5 nM) affinity sites could be accounted for by the contributions from cytosol and crude membrane, respectively. Separation of the high and low affinity sites was not achieved in goose lysates. PDB binding to intact goose erythrocytes exhibited the lower affinity (Kd approximately 30 nM) and was enhanced approximately 2-fold by incubation at 37 degrees C relative to incubation at 4 degrees C. This was due to an increased Bmax, with no change in Kd of the whole cell binding. Human erythrocytes did not demonstrate this temperature-enhanced binding of PDB to intact cells. These data are consistent with a temperature-induced translocation of PDB receptors from cytosol to membrane in goose erythrocytes. The failure of human erythrocytes to respond to PDB is not due to an absence of PDB receptors but may be related to the diminished number of receptors or to the lack of a temperature-induced increase in whole cell receptor number.

Waterfowl are natural reservoirs for zoonotic pathogens, and abundant resident (nonmigratory) Canada Geese (Branta canadensis) in urban and suburban environments pose the potential for transmission of Campylobacter through human contact with fecal deposits and contaminated water. In June 2008 and July 2009, we collected 318 fecal samples from resident Canada Geese at 21 locations in and around Greensboro, North Carolina, to test for Campylobacter. All campylobacter species detected were C. jejuni isolates, and prevalences in 2008 and 2009 were 5.0% and 16.0%, respectively. Prevalence of C. jejuni-positive sampling sites was 21% (3/14) and 40% (6/15) in 2008 and 2009, respectively. All C. jejuni isolates were susceptible to a panel of six antimicrobial agents (tetracycline, streptomycin, erythromycin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, and ciprofloxacin). We used pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and fla-typing to identify several strain types among these isolates. Multilocus sequence typing of representative isolates revealed six sequence types, of which two (ST-3708 and ST-4368) were new, two (ST-702 and ST-4080) had been detected previously among C. jejuni from geese, and two (ST-991 and ST-4071) were first reported in C. jejuni from an environmental water source and a human illness, respectively. These results indicate a diverse population of antibiotic-susceptible C. jejuni in resident Canada Geese in and around Greensboro, North Carolina, and suggest a need for additional assessment of the public health risk associated with resident Canada Geese in urban and suburban areas.

PACAP38 and PACAP27, tested at 0.0001-1 microM, potently stimulated synthesis of cyclic AMP in the hypothalamus and cerebral cortex of chicks; the effects of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) in the two brain regions were much weaker, reaching statistical significance only at 3 microM concentration. This characteristics suggests the existence in the bird's brain of adenylyl cyclase-linked PAC1 receptors. PACAP27 (0.001-1 microM) concentration-dependently stimulated cyclic AMP production in the hypothalamus and cerebral cortex of three other birds: duck, goose and turkey; the effects were, however, somewhat lower than those in chicks, but comparable to those found in rats. These data demonstrate PACAP to be capable of potently stimulating cyclic AMP generating system in the avian central nervous system.

Mice immunized with more SRBC than are required to produce optimal delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions, developed good antibody responses and poor delayed foot pad reactions. Cyclophosphamide treatment in low doses (20 mg/kg) before immunization, augmented the delayed-type hypersensitivity without affecting antibody responses. Cyclophosphamide did not augment delayed responses to optimal doses of SRBC (0.01%), but did augment the delayed hypersensitivity response of mice immunized with a suboptimal antigen dose (0.001%); which produced no detectable antibody response with or without cyclophosphamide pretreatment. These results suggest that antibody feedback is not the sole regulator of delayed reactions; the possibility that suppressor T cells may also be involved is discussed.

Berne virus possesses haemagglutinating activity which is inhibited by antisera that neutralize the infectivity of the virus. In decreasing order, human, rabbit and guinea-pig erythrocytes were agglutinated whereas agglutination was not observed with rat, goose, chicken or horse red blood cells. This pattern is different from that seen with the closely related Breda virus of cattle. Haemagglutinin was found to co-sediment with viral infectivity in sucrose density gradients. Transmission electron microscopy showed that intact virus particles form bridges between adjacent erythrocytes. The viral envelope was seen at a distance from the erythrocyte surface suggesting that the peplomers possess haemagglutinating activity. Haemagglutination was decreased in the presence of fetuin and gangliosides and also by pretreatment of the erythrocytes with periodate, suggesting that the virus binds to glycoproteins and/or glycolipids on the erythrocyte surface.

Escherichia albertii has been associated with diarrhea in humans but not with disease or infection in animals. However, in December 2004, E. albertii was found, by biochemical and genetic methods, to be the probable cause of death for redpoll finches (Carduelis flammea) in Alaska. Subsequent investigation found this organism in dead and subclinically infected birds of other species from North America and Australia. Isolates from dead finches in Scotland, previously identified as Escherichia coli O86:K61, also were shown to be E. albertii. Similar to the isolates from humans, E. albertii isolates from birds possessed intimin (eae) and cytolethal distending toxin (cdtB) genes but lacked Shiga toxin (stx) genes. Genetic analysis of eae and cdtB sequences, multilocus sequence typing, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns showed that the E. albertii strains from birds are heterogeneous but similar to isolates that cause disease in humans.

Waterfowl populations may serve as sentinel species for natural and anthropogenic toxicologic problems in the environment. Unfortunately, many toxins cause nonspecific clinical signs, acute mortality, and subtle or no pathologic changes, making toxicologic investigations extremely difficult. The purpose of this article is to review important waterfowl toxins, including heavy metals, pesticides, botulism, mycotoxins, algal toxins, and petroleum oil. When applicable, clinical signs, diagnosis, pathologic findings, and treatment are discussed. Although most of the information in the literature is based on wild waterfowl populations or experimental toxicologic investigations, the information is also applicable to captive waterfowl populations.

In this study, we investigate the role of liver X receptor alpha (LXR alpha) in lipogenesis in geese in order to understand the differences in hepatic steatosis mechanisms between mammals and waterfowl. Primary goose hepatocytes were isolated and treated with the LXR alpha agonist T0901317. Triglyceride (TG) accumulation, acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACC alpha) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) activities, and gene expression levels of LXR alpha, sterol regulatory element-binding proteins-1 (SREBP-1), FAS, ACC alpha and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) were measured in primary hepatocytes. We found a dose-dependent up-regulation of TG accumulation, ACC, and FAS activities and the mRNA levels of LXR alpha, SREBP-1, FAS, ACC alpha, and LPL genes in the presence of To-901317. We also found that binding of nuclear SREBP-1 to ACC alpha SRE sequence was induced by To-901317 (P < 0.05). In conclusion, LXR alpha is involved in the induction of the lipogenic pathway through activation of SREBP-1 and its target genes in goose primary hepatocytes.

1. The relative sensitivities of broiler chicks, White Leghorn chicks, quail chicks, goslings and turkey poults to increasing dietary contents of aflatoxin from 1 to 21 d of age were determined. Aflatoxin was included in the diets at three concentrations (0.7, 1.4 and 2.1 mg aflatoxin B1 equivalents/kg). 2. Data were analysed for species differences in food consumption, body weight, food utilisation, mortality and liver pathology. 3. There were no significant effects of aflatoxin in broiler and Leghorn chicks. Aflatoxin at 0.7 mg/kg decreased the body weight of turkey poults but tended to increase the growth rate of goslings. At 1.4 mg aflatoxin/kg food consumption, body weight and weight gain of goslings were adversely affected. 4. Liver damage occurred in goslings and quail chicks at all inclusions of aflatoxin and was extensive at 2.1 mg/kg. 5. Poults and goslings appeared to be the most sensitive, quail were intermediate and domestic chicks were most resistant.

Sera from 324 birds collected in an Ockelbo virus disease endemic area in central Sweden were examined for the presence of specific antibodies to Ockelbo virus by a plaque reduction neutralization test. Birds examined belonged to the orders Anseriformes (n = 207), Galliformes (n = 66) and Passeriformes (n = 51). Ockelbo virus neutralizing antibodies were detected in 26 (8%) of the specimens, including species from each of the three orders tested. Specific antibodies found in caged birds and in 6- to 10-week-old birds suggested local transmission. The highest antibody prevalence (27%, 14/51) was observed in the Passeriformes in which 5 of 9 species tested contained antibodies. The high antibody prevalence in passeriforms and the very large population of this group in relation to other avian groups in Sweden gives them a high potential as amplification hosts for Ockelbo virus.

Lysozyme is a widely distributed hydrolase possessing lytic activity against bacterial peptidoglycan, which enables it to protect the host against pathogenic infection. In the present study, the cDNA of an invertebrate goose-type lysozyme (designated CFLysG) was cloned from Zhikong scallop Chlamys farreri by expressed sequence tag (EST) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) techniques. The full-length cDNA of CFLysG consisted of 829 nucleotides with a canonical polyadenylation signal sequence AATAAA and a poly(A) tail, and an open reading frame (ORF) of 603 bp encoding a polypeptide of 200 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular weight of 21.92 kDa and theoretical isoelectric point of 7.76. The high similarity of CFLysG with goose-type (g-type) lysozymes in vertebrate indicated that CFLysG should be an invertebrate counterpart of g-type lysozyme family, which suggested that the origin of g-type lysozyme preceded the emergence of urochordates and even preceded the emergence of deuterostomes. Similar to most g-type lysozymes, CFLysG possessed all conserved features critical for the fundamental structure and function of g-type lysozymes, such as three catalytic residues (Glu 82, Asp 97, Asp 108). By Northern blot analysis, mRNA transcript of CFLysG was found to be most abundantly expressed in the tissues of gills, hepatopancreas and gonad, weakly expressed in the tissues of haemocytes and mantle, while undetectable in the adductor muscle. These results suggested that CFLysG could possess combined features of both the immune and digestive adaptive lysozymes. To gain insight into the in vitro lytic activities of CFLysG, the mature peptide coding region was cloned into Pichia pastoris for heterogeneous expression. Recombinant CFLysG showed inhibitive effect on the growth of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with more potent activities against Gram-positive bacteria, which indicated the involvement of CFLysG in the innate immunity of C. farreri.

Vasotocin-associated neurophysin (MSEL-neurophysin) has been purified from goose neurohypophysis through molecular sieving and high-pressure reverse-phase liquid chromatography (HPLC). The protein has a molecular mass (measured by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) of 17 kDa in contrast to 10 kDa found for the mammalian MSEL-neurophysins. Complete amino acid sequence (131 residues) has been determined mainly through tryptic or staphylococcal proteinase peptides derived from carboxyamidomethylated neurophysin, isolated by HPLC and microsequenced. N- and C-terminal sequences have been established by Edman degradation or action of carboxypeptidase Y, respectively, applied on the native protein. Goose MSEL-neurophysin is homologous to the two-domain "big" MSEL-neurophysin previously identified in the frog. It appears that in non-mammalian tetrapods, namely birds and amphibians, the proteolytic processing of the pro-vasotocin involves only one cleavage, releasing the hormone moiety and a "big" neurophysin with two domains homologous to mammalian MSEL-neurophysin and copeptin, respectively. Comparison of the avian protein with its mammalian and amphibian counterparts reveals that the first half of the polypeptide chain is evolutionarily much less variable than the second and that the goose protein resembles the frog protein much more than the mammalian one.

We prepared a Pertussis toxin-biotin conjugate and found its biological properties to be similar to those of native Pertussis toxin with respect to the hemagglutination, Chinese hamster ovary cell, and lymphocyte proliferation assays. Direct binding to Chinese hamster ovary and Jurkat cells was observed using fluorescence microscopy. Pertussis toxin-biotin was also found to possess similar glycoconjugate binding specificities as those of 125I-labeled Pertussis toxin.

A recombinant baculovirus (RBV) encoding the nucleoprotein (NP) of avian influenza virus (AIV) was generated and the appropriate protein was expressed in Sf9 cells. Purified recombinant NP and the NP-specific monoclonal antibody HB65 were used to establish a competitive ELISA (cELISA) system for the detection of NP-specific antibodies in sera of ducks, geese and wild birds. Tests to evaluate this method were carried out using sera of ducks experimentally infected with AIV, pre-immune duck and chicken sera, and poultry field sera, which tested negative in the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, and field sera of several poultry species experimentally infected with other viruses. The evaluation of the test demonstrated a high sensitivity and specificity of this method. Tests carried out using field sera of duck and goose flocks revealed widely corresponding results obtained by HI assay and cELISA indicating that this test is applicable for flock diagnosis. Differing results were obtained for individual samples. It can be assumed that for the most part this was because of a better recognition of the conserved NP antigen by serum antibodies, although some results remained unclear.

In light of the finding of a previously unknown coronavirus as the aetiology of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), it is probable that other coronaviruses, than those recognized to date, are circulating in animal populations. Here, the results of a screening for coronavirus are presented, using a universal coronavirus RT-PCR, of the bird species graylag goose (Anser anser), feral pigeon (Columbia livia) and mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). Coronaviruses were found in cloacal swab samples from all the three bird species. In the graylag goose, 40 of 163 sampled birds were coronavirus positive, whereas two of 100 sampled pigeons and one of five sampled mallards tested positive. The infected graylag geese showed lower body weights compared with virus-negative birds, suggesting clinical significance of the infection. Phylogenetic analyses performed on the replicase gene and nucleocapsid protein sequences, indicated that the novel coronaviruses described in the present study all branch off from group III coronaviruses. All the novel avian coronaviruses harboured the conserved s2m RNA structure in their 3' untranslated region, like other previously described group III coronaviruses, and like the SARS coronavirus. Sequencing of the complete nucleocapsid gene and downstream regions of goose and pigeon coronaviruses, evidenced the presence of two additional open reading frames for the goose coronavirus with no sequence similarity to known proteins, but with predicted transmembrane domains for one of the encoded proteins, and one additional open reading frame for the pigeon coronavirus, with a predicted transmembrane domain, downstream of the nucleocapsid gene.

We previously showed that the fatty liver formations observed in overfed geese are accompanied by the activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway and an increase in plasma insulin concentrations. Recent studies have suggested a crucial role for the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway in regulating lipid metabolism; therefore, we hypothesized that insulin affects goose hepatocellular lipid metabolism through the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway.

The diurnal and circadian profiles of pineal indoles, except melatonin, are poorly characterized in birds. Moreover, there are no data on the effect of sudden changes in the light-dark cycle on these profiles. Therefore, we investigated the diurnal (Experiment I) and circadian variation (Experiment II) of nine pineal indoles (tryptophan, 5-hydroxytryptophan, serotonin, N-acetylserotonin, melatonin, 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid, 5-methoxytryptophol, 5-methoxyindole acetic acid, 5-methoxytryptamine) in geese, as well as the changes in the profiles of these substances in geese subjected to a reversed light-dark cycle (Experiment III). For the first 12 weeks of life, all geese were kept under a diurnal cycle of 12 h of light and 12 h of darkness (12L:12D). In Experiment I (n = 48), they were kept under these conditions for another 14 days before being sacrificed at 2-h intervals for sampling of the pineal glands. In Experiment II, the geese (n = 48) were divided into three groups (12L:12D, 24L:0D, 0L:24D) for 10 days before sampling at 6-h intervals. In Experiment III, 24 geese were exposed to a reversed light-dark cycle before sampling at 14:00 and 02:00 on the first, second and third days after light-dark cycle reversal. To determine the content of the indoles in the goose pineals, HPLC with fluorescence detection was used. We found that, with the exception of tryptophan, all the investigated indoles showed statistically significant diurnal variation. When geese were kept in constant darkness, most of the indoles continued to show this variation, but when geese were kept in constant light, the indoles did not show significant variation. When the light-dark cycle was reversed (12L:12D to 12D:12L), the profiles of NAS, melatonin, 5-MTAM and 5-MTOL reflected the new cycle within 2 days. The content of serotonin in geese in 12L:12D was higher than that observed in other birds under these conditions, which suggests that this compound may play a special role in the pineal physiology of this species. In conclusion, our results show that the daily variations in the metabolism of melatonin-synthesis-related indoles in the goose pineal gland are generated endogenously and controlled by environmental light conditions, as in other birds. However, comparison of the results obtained with the goose to those obtained with other species (chicken, duck) unambiguously shows that the profiles of pineal indoles differ markedly between species, in both the quantitative proportions of the compounds and the characteristics of the diurnal changes. These findings provide strong arguments for the need for comparative studies.

Greylag geese (Anser anser) in the Guadalquivir Marshes (southwestern Spain) can be exposed to sources of inorganic pollution such as heavy metals and arsenic from mining activities or Pb shot used for hunting. We have sampled 270 fecal excreta in different areas of the marshes in 2001 to 2002 to evaluate the exposure to Pb, Zn, Cu, Mn, and As and to determine its relationship with soil ingestion and with the excretion of porphyrins and biliverdin as biomarkers. These effects and the histopathology of liver, kidney, and pancreas were also studied in 50 geese shot in 2002 to 2004. None of the geese had ingested Pb shot in the gizzard. This contrasts with earlier samplings before the ban of Pb shot for waterfowl hunting in 2001 and the removal of Pb shot in points of the Doñana National Park (Spain) in 1999 to 2000. The highest exposure through direct soil ingestion to Pb and other studied elements was observed in samples from Entremuros, the area of the Doñana Natural Park affected by the Aznalcóllar mine spill in 1998. Birds from Entremuros also more frequently showed mononuclear infiltrates in liver and kidney than birds from the unaffected areas, although other more specific lesions of Pb or Zn poisoning were not observed. The excretion of coproporphyrins, especially of the isomer I, was positively related to the fecal As concentration, and the ratio of coproporphyrin III/I was positively related to fecal Pb concentration. Biliary protoporphyrin IX concentration was also slightly related to hepatic Pb concentration. This study reflects biological effects on terrestrial animals by the mining pollution in Doñana that can be monitored with the simple noninvasive sampling of feces.

The underdiagnosed feather duvet lung, an extrinsic allergic alveolitis (hypersensitivity pneumonitis) caused by duck and goose feathers, can be more frequently diagnosed, if duck and goose feather antibodies are included in the panel of the routinely applied IgG antibody screening test. This does not necessarily require extending the screening test to include duck and goose feather antigens. By analysing 100 sera with duck and goose antibodies we found that the commonly used pigeon and budgerigar antibodies can also screen for feather duvet antibodies. All examined sera lacking pigeon and budgerigar antibodies also lacked clear-cut duck and goose feather antibodies. The examined sera with strong pigeon or budgerigar antibodies always also contained feather duvet antibodies. However, sera with medium or low concentrated pigeon or budgerigar antibodies are not always associated with feather duvet antibodies. In the light of these observations, we find that 71% of the duck and goose antibody analyses would be dispensable without essential loss of quality, if the results of screening for pigeon and budgerigar antibodies were incorporated into the procedure of a step-by- step diagnostics.

Mycoplasma anatis, M. anseris, M. cloacale and M. sp. 1220 colonise geese and ducks, and could be associated with infections of avian respiratory and nervous systems, cause mild to severe inflammation of cloaca and genital tracts, and embryo lethality. Co-occurrence of these Mycoplasma species in waterfowl is frequently detected and the identification of these mycoplasmas to the species level at a regular microbiology laboratory is difficult due to their similar morphological, cultural and biochemical properties. Moreover, species differentiation is only possible based on the sequence analysis of the product of a genus-specific PCR assay. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to develop an effective and robust method for the identification of these species in avian clinical specimens. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays using species-specific primers, which target housekeeping genes in order to identify these species, were designed in the present study. The developed PCR assays can precisely identify these four mycoplasmas to the species level directly from DNA samples extracted from clinical specimens, and no cross-amplification was observed among these species and with other well-known avian mycoplasmas. The average sensitivity of the assays was 101-102 genomic equivalents per reaction. These conventional PCR assays can be run simultaneously at the same PCR cycling program, and the species can be differentiated directly (without sequence analysis) by gel electrophoresis due to the specific sizes of the amplicons. In conclusion, the presented species-specific assays were found to be suitable for routine use at regular veterinary diagnostic laboratories and promote the rapid, simple and cost-effective differentiation of these waterfowl Mycoplasma species.

The erythrocytes of various species were tested in psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD) virus haemagglutination (HA) and haemagglutination inhibition assays to determine which are suitable for use in these assays. HA activity was observed for erythrocytes of the salmon-crested cockatoo, the sulphur-crested cockatoo, the umbrella cockatoo, the goffin's cockatoo and the cockatiel, with differences amongst individuals within species, but not for erythrocytes of humans, the pig, the guinea pig, the chicken, the goose, the rose-ringed parakeet or the budgerigar. Anti-PBFD virus rabbit sera inhibited the virus-induced agglutination of erythrocytes, confirming the specificity of HA activity. This suggests that selection of suitable psittacine species as well as suitable individuals within a species is necessary when obtaining erythrocytes for the PBFD virus HA assay.

Forty-seven Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strains isolated from fecal samples of waterfowls in Alaska and Siberia from 1991 to 1996 were analyzed for their virulence. None of the viruses formed plaques on MDBK cells in the absence of trypsin. Of these, 29 strains showed virulent character by the mean death time with the minimum lethal dose in chicken embryos comparable to velogenic NDV strains. Of the 29 strains, 11 were sequenced for their fusion protein (F) gene. The results showed that 5 of them contained a pair of dibasic amino acids at the cleavage site of the F, which is of a virulent type. The present results suggest that potentially virulent strains of NDV are maintained in migratory waterfowl populations in nature, and that some of those may be transmitted to domestic poultry and acquire pathogenicity during passages in chicken population.

δ-Crystallin is the major structural protein in avian eye lenses and is homologous to the urea cycle enzyme argininosuccinate lyase. This protein is structurally assembled as double dimers. Lys-315 is the only residue which is arranged symmetrically at the diagonal subunit interfaces to interact with each other. This study found that wild-type protein had both dimers and monomers present in 2-4 M urea whilst only monomers of the K315A mutant were observed under the same conditions, as judged by sedimentation velocity analysis. The assembly of monomeric K315A mutant was reversible in contrast to wild-type protein. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the dissociation of primary dimers is prior to the diagonal dimers in wild-type protein. These results suggest the critical role of Lys-315 in stabilization of the diagonal dimer structure. Guanidinium hydrochloride (GdmCl) denatured wild-type or K315A mutant protein did not fold into functional protein. However, the urea dissociated monomers of K315A mutant protein in GdmCl were reversible folding through a multiple steps mechanism as measured by tryptophan and ANS fluorescence. Two partly unfolded intermediates were detected in the pathway. Refolding of the intermediates resulted in a conformation with greater amounts of hydrophobic regions exposed which was prone to the formation of protein aggregates. The formation of aggregates was not prevented by the addition of α-crystallin. These results highlight that the conformational status of the monomers is critical for determining whether reversible oligomerization or aggregate formation occurs.

Despite substantial interest in the trace element content of eggs by poultry breeders, nutritionists, and environmental scientists, available data about trace elements levels in eggs are scarce. Trace element contents in yolk and albumen of chicken, turkey, duck, goose, and pigeon eggs were analyzed to establish a baseline dataset and assess differences among trace element content in avian species. We measured the selenium (Se), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), molybdenum (Mo), vanadium (V), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and thallium (Tl) contents in both yolk and albumen by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. One hundred twenty eggs deriving from 24 birds of each species, reared in the same poultry farm in northern Greece, were used; bird feed was common and based on cereals and legumes and contained no added vitamins or microminerals. Trace element contents in yolks were far higher than those in albumen, except for V and Ni. In yolks, the highest content for Se, Mo, and Tl were in pigeon eggs, for Zn, Mn, Cu, and Cr in turkey eggs, and for Co and Ni in goose eggs. In albumen, Se was highest in duck eggs, while Zn, Mn, and Co in pigeon ones. It is concluded that there is a substantial, up to threefold, variation for trace element contents in eggs among different domestic avian species offered the same feed.

In previous studies we examined the role of Canada Geese (Branta canadensis) in the epidemiology of Eurasian highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1. To expand on this and better understand how pre-exposure to heterosubtypic low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses might influence the outcome of H5N1 HPAI infection, we pre-exposed naïve juvenile Canada Geese to different North American wild-bird-origin LPAI viruses. We selected H1, H2, and H6 hemagglutinin subtype viruses based on their higher-order evolutionary relatedness to the H5 hemagglutinin. Pre-exposing Canada Geese to either H2N3 or H6N5 viruses did not protect them against a lethal H5N1 HPAI virus challenge. In addition, H5N1 was transmitted to naïve control birds that were placed among both groups resulting in death by 5 days postcontact. In contrast, Canada Geese that were pre-exposed to H1N1 were protected against a lethal H5N1 challenge, shed minimal amounts of the virus into the environment, and did not transmit the infection to naïve contact birds. None of the H1N1, H2N3, or H6N5 pre-exposure sera neutralized H5N1 in vitro; however, sera from H1N1-infected birds reduced virus plaque size but not number when compared with H2N3, H6N5, or negative sera, suggesting that antibodies directed against the neuraminidase may have had a role in the protective effects observed.

The first detection of avian nephritis virus (ANV) in goose embryos and of turkey astrovirus-1 (TAstV-1) in duck embryos is described. Intestinal samples from duck and goose embryos from five duck and four goose flocks in Croatia were tested by polymerase chain reaction for the presence of ANV, TAstV-1, turkey astrovirus-2, chicken astrovirus, duck astrovirus and also for the presence of avian reovirus, Derzsy's disease virus and duck enteritis virus. The kidneys from duck and goose embryos were also tested for ANV, while liver samples were tested for duck astrovirus. Duck embryos were also tested to detect duck circovirus and goose embryos for the presence of goose circovirus and goose haemorrhagic polyomavirus. All embryos were in the final stage of incubation and were characterized by moderate to markedly retarded growth. ANV was confirmed in the intestines and kidneys of embryos from two duck and two goose flocks and TAstV-1 was found in embryos from two duck flocks. One duck flock was positive for both ANV and TAstV-1. No other viruses were found in tested flocks. Phylogenetic analysis based on the ANV polymerase gene fragment of ANV sequences detected in duck and goose embryos revealed greatest similarity (88.1 to 97.2%) with ANV isolates from chickens. Further, the existence of at least two types of ANV circulating in Croatian duck and goose flocks was confirmed. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the portion of TAstV-1 polymerase gene, two detected TAstV-1 nucleotide sequences were 99.5% similar. Compared with six TAstV-1 sequences, Croatian sequences showed one unique nucleotide change. In addition to other possible causes of stunted growth and late embryonic death, these findings suggest that ANV and/or TAstV-1 infection may be a contributing factor in the pre-hatching mortality of ducklings and goslings.

Veterinarians in Hungary were asked to complete a questionnaire on traumatic myiasis; of the 664 veterinarians contacted, 247 replied (37.2 per cent) and of these 209 (84.6 per cent) reported myiasis to be a problem among the livestock they treated. Infestation levels of > 10 per cent of animals were reported in sheep, cattle and horses. The myiasis season lasted from March to November with most cases reported in July and August. Significantly more respondents reported that fly larvae were present deep in wounds rather than superficially, consistent with infestations due to the obligate parasite Wohlfahrtia magnifica (Diptera: Sarcophagidae). Frequent inspections and the treatment of infested animals were reported by 64.1 per cent of respondents as contributing to the economic impact of traumatic myiasis, and approximately half of the respondents (51.4 per cent) reported that inspections and treatments were carried out at least weekly during the summer. The most common form of treatment was the manual removal of larvae followed by topical application of insecticides, particularly organophosphates. More than half of the respondents (56.6 per cent) reported that there had been no change in the importance of myiasis over the last five to 10 years, but of those who reported a change, more reported an increase (28.3 per cent) than a decrease (15.2 per cent).

Using reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we have screened more than 8500 wild birds in Northern Europe in 1999 and 2000 for the presence of influenza A virus. Although our primary focus was on ducks, geese, and shorebirds, we have also tested thousands of samples from other bird species. Approximately 1% of our samples were positive for influenza A virus by RT-PCR, and from half of these we were able to isolate influenza A virus in embryonated chicken eggs. A wide variety of isolates was obtained representing hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes 1 through 7, 10, 11, 13, an unidentifiable HA, and neuraminidase (NA) subtypes 1 through 8.

Goose parvovirus (GPV) is the etiological agent of Derzsy's disease, with a natural reservoir consisting only of geese and Muscovy ducks. However, the pathological changes in the immune organs of ducklings experimentally infected with GPV remain unknown. In this study, 2-day-old Cherry Valley ducklings were intramuscularly injected with GPV. Immune organs (e.g., thymus, bursa of Fabricius, spleen, Harderian gland, cecal tonsil, bone marrow, and peripheral blood lymphocytes [PBLs]) were collected 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 days post-infection (dpi). Pathological lesions were assessed by histology and the viral load was concurrently assessed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. GPV antigen was detected via immunofluorescence staining and immunohistochemistry. No clinical symptoms or death were observed in the infected ducklings from 1 to 14 dpi; however, lesions with different degrees of hemorrhage and hyperemia were observed in the thymus, spleen and Harderian gland. Lymphocyte necrosis was identified in the thymus and spleen. In the immune organs, the highest viral loads were found in the spleen at 7 dpi, followed by the bone marrow, PBLs, and cecal tonsil at 3 dpi, and the bursa, Harderian gland, and thymus at 1 dpi. GPV antigen was primarily expressed in the cecal tonsil, spleen, and Harderian gland at 5 dpi, as well as in the PBLs and bone marrow at 3 dpi. Our findings indicate widespread GPV replication and dissemination in the immune organs of Cherry Valley ducklings.

Complete consensus genome sequences were determined for avian paramyxovirus type 8 (APMV-8) strains goose/Delaware/1053/76 (prototype strain) and pintail/Wakuya/20/78. The genome of each strain is 15,342 nucleotides (nt) long, which follows the "rule of six". The genome consists of six genes in the order of 3'-N-P/V/W-M-F-HN-L-5'. The genes are flanked on either side by conserved transcription start and stop signals, and have intergenic regions ranging from 1 to 30nt. The genome contains a 55nt leader region at the 3'-end and a 171nt trailer region at the 5'-end. Comparison of sequences of strains Delaware and Wakuya showed nucleotide identity of 96.8% at the genome level and amino acid identities of 99.3%, 96.5%, 98.6%, 99.4%, 98.6% and 99.1% for the predicted N, P, M, F, HN and L proteins, respectively. Both strains grew in embryonated chicken eggs and in primary chicken embryo kidney cells, and 293T cells. Both strains contained only a single basic residue at the cleavage activation site of the F protein and their efficiency of replication in vitro depended on and was augmented by, the presence of exogenous protease in most cell lines. Sequence alignment and phylogenic analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of APMV-8 strain Delaware proteins with the cognate proteins of other available APMV serotypes showed that APMV-8 is more closely related to APMV-2 and -6 than to APMV-1, -3 and -4.

Seven Vibrio-like field strains of German origin were isolated culturally from diseased domesticated ducks, muscovy ducks and geese, and were compared with reference strains NCTC 8443 (type strain) and NCTC 11170 of Vibrio metschnicovii using classical phenotypic and chemotaxonomic tests. Some V. cholerae strains were included in the chemotaxonomic tests for comparative purposes. On the basis of the classical phenotypic characteristics studied and the numerical analysis of the whole-cell fatty acid patterns, the Vibrio-like field strains were identified as Vibrio metschnicovii. The identification tables and the database of the computer software of two commercial micro-identification kits (API-20 NE, ID-32 E) did not identify the field strains. Of the reference strains used, only NCTC 8443 was correctly identified by the ID-32 E software.

A recent Canada goose (Branta canadensis) die-off at a petroleum refinery fly ash pond in Delaware was attributed to vanadium (V) toxicity. Because of the paucity of V toxicity data for wild birds, a series of studies was undertaken using the forms of V believed to have resulted in this incident. In 7-d single oral dose trials with mallard drakes (Anas platyrhynchos), the estimated median lethal dose (LD50) for vanadium pentoxide was 113 mg/kg body weight, while the LD50 for sodium metavanadate was 75.5 mg/kg. Sodium metavanadate was found to be even more potent (LD50 = 37.2 mg/kg) in male Canada geese. The most distinctive histopathological lesion of both forms of V was lympho-granulocytic enteritis with hemorrhage into the intestinal lumen. Vanadium accumulation in liver and kidney was proportional to the administered dose, and predictive analyses based on these data suggest that V concentrations of 10 microg/g dry weight (dw) in liver and 25 microg/g dw in kidney are associated with mortality (>90% confidence that exposure is >LD50) in mallards acutely exposed to sodium metavanadate. Chronic exposure to increasing dietary concentrations of sodium metavanadate (38.5 to 2651 ppm) over 67 d resulted in V accumulation in liver and kidney (25.2 and 13.6 microg/g dw, respectively), mild intestinal hemorrhage, blood chemistry changes, and evidence of hepatic oxidative stress in mallards, although some of these responses may have been confounded by food avoidance and weight loss. Dietary exposure of mallards to 250 ppm sodium metavanadate for 4 wk resulted in modest accumulation of V in liver and kidney (<5 microg/g dw) and mild intestinal hemorrhage. Based on these data and other observations, it is unlikely that chronic low-level dietary exposure to V poses a direct lethal hazard to wildlife. However, point sources, such as the V-laden fly ash pond encountered by geese at the petroleum refinery in Delaware, may pose a significant hazard to water birds.

To deepen the knowledge about epidemic prevalence in the goose breeding field, a triplex PCR assay was established, and 478 samples were collected from scaled goose farms in 11 provinces in China. The results of this epidemiological investigation showed that incidence rates of H9 avian influenza and goose circovirus were the highest among five infectious diseases that were evaluated. In addition, the triplex PCR assay established remarkable sensitivity, rapidity and versatility compared to other diagnostic methods. Dual infection comprised a large proportion of the co-infections in the field, of which the combinations of H9/Tembusu, H9/goose circovirus and goose circovirus/Tembusu co-infected cases were more common. Epidemics were more severe in winter and spring. Additionally, significant differences in the prevalence of these infectious diseases were observed in association with different age groups. In addition, phylogenetic analysis, determined by the neighbour-joining method, was carried out to investigate the evolution of these viruses during the study period. For the most part, virus strains isolated during the study were consistent with most goose-origin strains isolated from the Chinese mainland over the past few years. However, mutations were observed between isolated H9 avian influenza virus strains and sequences available from GenBank, which should draw much attention.

The researches included geese, broiler chickens and reproductive laying hens. The occurrence of Salmonella rods assigned to the serovars in the bird flocks was assessed for the years 2001-2005. In geese, during 2001-2003, S. typhimurium was isolated most frequently, whereas in 2004 - S. enteriditis (42.8%). Throughout the research period, in the flocks of reproductive laying hens, the S. enteriditis proved the most commonly reported serovar (67.8%). Among broiler chickens in 2001, S. typhimurium prevailed by only a slight percentage (45.1%). In the bird flocks under investigation, the highest Salmonella rate was obtained from the dead embryos, followed by cloacal swabs, inner organs of birds and faeces, while the lowest was detected in the litter obtained from chick breeding boxes.

In the presence of GdmCl (guanidinium chloride), tetrameric delta-crystallin undergoes dissociation via a dimeric state to a monomeric molten globule intermediate state. The latter are denatured at higher GdmCl concentrations in a multi-state manner. In the present study, the X-ray structure of goose delta-crystallin was determined to 2.8 A (1 A=0.1 nm). In this structure the first 25 N-terminal residues interact with a hydrophobic cavity in a neighbouring molecule, stabilizing the quaternary structure of this protein. When these 25 residues were deleted this did not produce any gross structural changes, as judged by CD analysis, but slightly altered tryptophan fluorescence and ANS (8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulphonic acid) spectra. The dimeric form was significantly identified as judged by sedimentation velocity and nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. This mutant had increased sensitivity to temperature denaturation and GdmCl concentrations of 0.3-1.0 M. This protein was destabilized about 3.3 kcal/mol (1 kcal=4.184 kJ) due to N-terminal truncation. After incubation at 37 degrees C N-terminal truncated proteins were prone to aggregation, suggesting the presence of the unstable dimeric conformation. An important role for the N-terminus in dimer assembly of goose delta-crystallin is proposed.

This work aimed to develop an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (i-ELISA), based on the structural protein VP2 of goose parvovirus (GPV), for the detection of antibodies to GPV in blood serum. In this study, the capsid protein VP2 of GPV was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by nickel chromatography. The purified protein was capable of reacting with GPV antibodies, as analysed by Western blot. An i-ELISA based on the protein VP2 was developed. For evaluation of the newly developed ELISA, 192 field sera collected from six goose herds were tested in parallel by the serum neutralization (SN) test. The result showed that 138 samples were positive and 49 negative in both cases. The agreement of the two tests was 97·3%. This i-ELISA has high sensitivity and good specificity and is an alternative serologic test for the detection of the antibodies to GPV in blood serum.

Lysozymes as an important immune factor, play vital roles in innate immune response against pathogen infection. In the present study, one c-type and g-type lysozymes were identified from Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus). They shared highly conserved structural features with lysozymes from other species. Spatial expression analysis revealed that AdlysC transcript was most abundant in liver and stomach, and least in muscle and brain. In contrast, the expression level of AdlysG was most abundant in liver and least in muscle and skin. The transcription level of c-type and g-type lysozymes were up-regulated after Aeromonas hydrophila infection in liver and spleen, indicating their participations in the immune response. Moreover, the recombinant AdlysC and AdlysG protein were produced and purified, and were used to investigate the lysozyme activity at different pH and temperatures. The optimal lytic activity was determined at pH 6.0 and at a temperature of 30 °C. Through the minimal inhibitory concentration test, the rAdlysC and rAdlysG exhibited apparent antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with a variable concentration. In conclusion, it is the first report of lysozymes in A. davidianus, and c-type and g-type lysozymes should be involved in the innate immune response of A. davidianus.

We report the isolation and characterization of a paramyxovirus from geese in South China during 1997. The isolate, designated as goose paramyxovirus/QingYuan 1997-1 (GPMV/QY97-1), showed pathogenicity to geese and could agglutinate chicken erythrocytes. Its hemagglutinating activity was inhibited by antiavian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (APMV-1) serum. The F gene of isolate was amplified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and sequence analysis proved that its sequence conformed to that reported in the literature, encoding an F0 protein of 553 amino acids with 13 cysteine residues and 6 potential glycosylation sites. It also contained multiple basic amino acids at the deduced cleavage site of the fusion protein, which is a typical feature of highly virulent APMV-1 strains. Sequences analysis of the F gene of GPMV/QY97-1 revealed a homology with other APMV-1 isolates, with its identity ranging from 84.1% to 99.9% on a nudeotide basis and from 88.8% to 99.6% on an amino acid basis. Phylogenetic analysis of the APMV-1 isolates showed that this isolate most closely resembled the reference APMV-1 strain GD/1/98/Go, which was originally isolated from geese in 1998.

Sera from wild geese were tested for antibodies to selected viral pathogens at a resting site for wild waterfowl in Germany. Serum samples from both bean geese (Anser fabalis) and white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons) collected in October 1991 were examined using serological methods licensed for routine diagnosis in domestic poultry. Of 130 sera tested, antibodies to several infectious agents were found including Newcastle disease virus (45%), goose parvovirus (48%), avian reovirus (29%), and avian adenovirus or egg drop syndrome 76 virus (6%). Antibodies against duck hepatitis virus were not detected. Differences in seroprevalences were not detected between the two geese species. While role and significance of wild geese in the epidemiology of avian diseases remains to be determined, it is possible that they could be of some importance as reservoirs and carriers of certain viral diseases of domestic poultry.

1. Factors controlling adaptive hypertrophy, which occurs when marine, or potentially marine, birds drink salt water, have been investigated in geese and ducks using changes in salt-weight weight, RNA and DNA contents as indices of this process. 2. Unilateral post-ganglionic denervation in geese prevented the changes in [RNA] and [RNA]:[DNA] that occurred in the intact gland of birds given salt water for 24 hr; denervation had no significant effect in birds on fresh water throughout. 3. Atropine treatment also prevented the adaptive changes in geese given salt water. 4. In ducks give 0.3 M-NaCl for 48 hr salt-gland weight, [RNA] and [RNA]:[DNA] increase markedly. Treatment of ducks drinking fresh water with large doses of corticosterone and mammalian ACTH for 48 hr had no significant effects on salt-gland weight, RNA or DNA; mammalian prolactin treatment for 48 hr significantly raised [RNA]. 5. No changes in the total amount of DNA in the glands were observed in these experiments, thus indicating that hyperplasia does not occur within 48 hr of a bird first drinking salt water. 6. It is concluded that adaptive hypertrophy is controlled by secretory nerves, and that hormones, if they play any part in this process, have a permissive or secondary role. It is suggested that hypertrophy and the maintenance of the secretory cells in the fully-adapted state may be obligatorily related to secretory activity induced by cholinergic secretory nerves.

Little is known about Salmonella serovars circulating in backyard poultry and swine populations worldwide. Backyard production systems (BPS) that raise swine and/or poultry are distributed across Chile, but are more heavily concentrated in central Chile, where industrialized systems are in close contact with BPS. This study aims to detect and identify circulating Salmonella serovars in poultry and swine raised in BPS. Bacteriological Salmonella isolation was carried out for 1744 samples collected from 329 BPS in central Chile. Faecal samples were taken from swine, poultry, geese, ducks, turkeys and peacocks, as well as environmental faecal samples. Confirmation of Salmonella spp. was performed using invA-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Identification of serovars was carried out using a molecular serotyping approach, where serogroups were confirmed by a multiplex PCR of Salmonella serogroup genes for five Salmonella O antigens (i.e., D, B, C1, C2-C3, and E1), along with two PCR amplifications, followed by sequencing of fliC and fljB genes. A total of 25 samples (1·4% of total samples) from 15 BPS (4·6 % of total sampled BPS) were found positive for Salmonella. Positive samples were found in poultry (chickens and ducks), swine and environmental sources. Molecular prediction of serovars on Salmonella isolated showed 52·0% of S. Typhimurium, 16·0% of S. Infantis, 16·0% S. Enteritidis, 8·0% S. Hadar, 4·0% S. Tennessee and 4·0% S. Kentucky. Poor biosecurity measures were found on sampled BPS, where a high percentage of mixed confinement systems (72·8%); and almost half of the sampled BPS with improper management of infected mortalities (e.g. selling the carcasses of infected animals for consumption). Number of birds other than chickens (P = 0·014; OR = 1·04; IC (95%) = 1·01-1·07), mixed productive objective (P = 0·030; OR = 5·35; IC (95%) = 1·24-27·59) and mixed animal replacement origin (P = 0017; OR = 5·19; IC (95%) = 1·35-20·47) were detected as risk factors for BPS positivity to Salmonella spp. This is the first evidence of serovars of Salmonella spp. circulating in BPS from central Chile. Detected serovars have been linked to human and animal clinical outbreaks worldwide and in Chile, highlighting the importance of BPS on the control and dissemination of Salmonella serovars potentially hazardous to public health.

This study was conducted to clone the prolactin gene (PRL) in Eastern Zhejiang White Geese and to investigate the PRL gene expression characteristics during egg-laying, out-of-lay and incubating periods by real time PCR. Comparisons were made respectively of concentration of prolactin mRNA in the hypothalamus, pituitary gland and ovary of the adult female geese at different reproductive periods. The result indicated that there were significant differences (P<0.05) in PRL mRNA expression between different reproductive periods of the geese. The lowest level of PRL expression was found in out-of-lay geese, higher in the egg-laying geese, and the highest in incubating geese. Furthermore, the analysis of PRL expression in different tissues indicated that the highest levels of PRL was expressed in the pituitary gland, followed in hypothalamus, and the least in ovary of the geese. There were significant difference (P<0.01) expression of PRL between the pituitary gland/hypothalamus and ovary of the geese, whereas no any difference was observed between the pituitary gland and hypothalamus (P>0.05). In summary, the PRL mRNA expression had variance in different reproductive periods of the geese.

In this study, a total of 323 Salmonella enterica strains were isolated from 3,566 rectal swab samples of 51 poultry farms in seven regions of 12 provinces of China between 2006 and 2012. The prevalences of Salmonella sp. carriage were 12.4% in geese (66 positive/533 samples), 10.4% in turkeys (32/309), 9.8% in chickens (167/1,706), 6.8% in ducks (41/601), and 4.1% in pigeons (17/417), respectively. These isolates belonged to 20 serovars, in which the most frequent serovars were S. enterica serovar Gallinarum biovar Pullorum (herein, S. Pullorum) (55 isolates, 17.0%), S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (50 isolates, 15.5%), and S. enterica serovar Enteritidis (39 isolates, 12.1%). Overall, S. Typhimurium was the most commonly detected serovar; among the individual species, S. Pullorum was most commonly isolated from chickens, S. Enteritidis was most common in ducks, S. Typhimurium was most common in geese and pigeons, and S. enterica serovar Saintpaul was most common in turkeys. PCR determination of 20 fimbrial genes demonstrated the presence of bcfD, csgA, fimA, stdB, and sthE genes and the absence of staA and stgA genes in these isolates, and other loci were variably distributed, with frequency values ranging from 11.8 to 99.1%. These 323 Salmonella isolates were subdivided into 41 different fimbrial genotypes, and of these isolate, 285 strains (88.2%) had 12 to 14 fimbrial genes. Our findings indicated that the Salmonella isolates from different poultry species were phenotypically and genetically diverse and that some fimbrial genes are more frequently associated with serovars or serogroups.

Flavivirus envelope protein locates at the outermost surface of viral particle and mediates virus entry and fusion infection, and domains I and II of E protein play an important role in this process. In this study, we have expressed and purified goose tembusu virus (GTV) E protein domains I and II (DI/II) from E. coli, and tested conceptual approach that purified protein serves as anti-viral reagent. We found that DI/II inhibited GTV JS804 infection in BHK-21 cells in a dose-dependent manner, and this inhibition activity was achieved by binding to cell membrane specifically. Moreover, JS804 treated with DI/II specific anti-serum decreased its infectivity to BHK-21 cells. Taken together, this is first to show that the purified DI/II domain of tembusu virus expressed in E. coli was able to interfere with virus infection, which opens an avenue to develop novel anti-viral regents to prevent and eventually eradicate GTV infection.

The effect on ketonemia of alternate exposure to ambient temperatures (Ta) of 25 and 5 degrees C was investigated in fasting geese. Three experimental birds were compared to three controls continuously exposed to 25 degrees C Ta while fasting. During the first 9 days of fasting, when both groups were exposed to 25 degrees C, plasma concentration of beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) increased similarly in both, from 0.10 +/- 0.02 to 6.62 +/- 0.71 mmol X L-1. It later plateaued at 8-9 mmol X L-1 in the control birds. When the experimental birds were exposed to 5 degrees C Ta between the 9th and 15th day of the fast, it increased further during the first 24 h but thereafter decreased of 57%, from 8.62 +/- 1.56 to 3.73 +/- 1.24 mmol X L-1. This decrease was reversed within the 6 days of return to 25 degrees C Ta. In both groups, plasma acetoacetate (AcAc) concentration remained very low during the fast: 51 +/- 1 mumol X L-1. This reversible cold-induced effect on ketonemia may be used for investigating the possible role of ketone bodies in protein sparing during fasting.

Pathogens utilize type III secretion systems to deliver effector proteins, which facilitate bacterial infections. The Escherichia coli type III secretion system 2 (ETT2) which plays a crucial role in bacterial virulence, is present in the majority of E. coli strains, although ETT2 has undergone widespread mutational attrition. We investigated the distribution and characteristics of ETT2 in avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC) isolates and identified five different ETT2 isoforms, including intact ETT2, in 57·6% (141/245) of the isolates. The ETT2 locus was present in the predominant APEC serotypes O78, O2 and O1. All of the ETT2 loci in the serotype O78 isolates were degenerate, whereas an intact ETT2 locus was mostly present in O1 and O2 serotype strains, which belong to phylogenetic groups B2 and D, respectively. Interestingly, a putative second type III secretion-associated locus (eip locus) was present only in the isolates with an intact ETT2. Moreover, ETT2 was more widely distributed in APEC isolates and exhibited more isoforms compared to ETT2 in human extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli, suggesting that APEC might be a potential risk to human health. However, there was no distinct correlation between ETT2 and other virulence factors in APEC.

Ingested shotgun pellets were found in 13 of 56 hunter-killed wild waterfowl between October and December 1991 from two hunting grounds in Japan. Four of 33 other waterfowl found dead in lightly hunted areas between January 1991 and March 1992 were diagnosed as having lead poisoning. We propose that lead poisoning maybe a threat to waterfowl in Japan.

Fusariotoxin T-2, a trichothecene, was tentatively identified in barley samples which caused field outbreaks of mycotoxicosis in British Columbia. Geese died when fed the contaminated barley experimentally but mice were little affected after long term feeding. The methods used in the laboratory for trichothecene extraction and identification of T-2 toxin are described.

Three Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strains recovered from ND outbreaks in chickens and duck flocks in north china during 2009 to 2011 were completely sequenced and biologically characterized. All the strains were velogenic and had the velogenic motif 112R-R-Q-K-R-F117 which was consistent with the results of biological tests. Analysis of the variable region (nucleotide 47 to 420) of the F gene indicated that the three isolates belonged to genotype VII d. Cross hemagglutination inhibition test indicated that the antigen homology between three isolates and LaSota were 82.5%-89.4%, the homology between the two isolates from chicken was 90%. A cross-protection experiment in which specific-pathogen-free chickens vaccinated with LaSota were challenged by SDLY01 isolate showed that LaSota vaccine could provide complete protection against SDLY01, however virus discharge could be detected on fifth day. Challenge experiment in which Cherry Valley duck of 30 day old challenged with SD03 strain indicated that cherry valley duck had no disease in experiment period, but virus discharge could be detected from Larynx and cloaca until fifth day. Genome length of three NDV isolates was 15192bp and belonged to genotype VII d. Sequence analysis clarified that the whole genomic sequence of these three isolates shared high homology with NDV virus strains isolated from goose and duck over the same period, which elucidated that NDV isolated from goose, duck or chicken had close genetics and epidemiological relationship.

Waterfowl mortality caused by aflatoxicosis occurred in two separate areas in Texas during the 1977-78 wintering season. The first outbreak occurred in snow geese (Anser caerulescens) on the Gulf Coast prairies, followed by an outbreak in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) in the north-central portion of the state. Aflatoxin B1 levels in geese were 500 ng/g (dry weight). Aflatoxin B1 levels in the second mortality were 10-250 ng/g (dry weight). The exact source of the toxin was not demonstrated in the first outbreak, but in the second outbreak was traced to waste peanuts, which constituted a major portion of the diet of wintering waterfowl in north-central Texas. Aflatoxin B1 levels in the field peanuts collected in the general areas were 110 ng/g.

Nineteen lead-poisoned white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons), including nine immature birds, were examined pathologically. Subacute lead poisoning due to ingestion of spent lead shots was diagnosed pathologically and confirmed by demonstrating high lead concentration in the liver. The liver lead concentration ranged from 6.9 to 67.7 mg/kg wet weight. The most suggestive gross lesions were mottled bile-stained liver in eight geese and proventricular impaction and/or the presence of lead pellets in the gizzard. Histologic lesions of the liver consisted of Kupffer cell hemosiderosis, large bile plugs in dilated canaliculi, bile pigmentation in hepatocytes, and bile extravasation and associated hepatic necrosis. Seven geese of the remaining 11 birds also had hepatic necrosis in the liver, the greenish discoloration of which was obscure macroscopically. The liver discoloration was considered a jaundice due to both rapid overproduction of bile from increased breakdown of erythrocytes and intrahepatic impaired excretion of bile. The severity of lesions was not correlated to the liver lead concentrations. All examined geese had hemosiderosis of mononuclear phagocytic system cells in the spleen and hypoplasia or edema of the bone marrow with increased numbers of polychromatic erythroblasts. These prominent changes probably resulted from excess breakdown of erythrocytes, hypercholia followed by intrahepatic cholestasis, and disrupted erythropoiesis in bone marrow caused by lead.

A total of 15 dead or sick birds from 13 clinical outbreaks of avian influenza in ducks, geese, chickens and turkeys in 2017 in Bangladesh were examined. The presence of H5N1 influenza A virus in the affected birds was detected by RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analysis based on full-length gene sequences of all eight gene segments revealed that these recent outbreaks were caused by a new reassortant of clade 2.3.2.1a H5N1 virus, which had been detected earlier in 2015 during surveillance in live bird markets (LBMs) and wet lands. This reassortant virus acquired PB2, PB1, PA, NP and NS genes from low pathogenic avian influenza viruses mostly of non-H9N2 subtypes but retained HA, NA and M genes of the old clade 2.3.2.1a viruses. Nevertheless, the HA gene of these new viruses was 2.7% divergent from that of the old clade 2.3.2.1a viruses circulated in Bangladesh. Interestingly, similar reassortment events could be traced back in four 2.3.2.1a virus isolates of 2013 from backyard ducks. It suggests that this reassortant virus emerged in 2013, which took two years to be detected at a broader scale (i.e. in LBMs), another two years until it became widely spread in poultry and fully replaced the old viruses. Several mutations were detected in the recent Bangladeshi isolates, which are likely to influence possible phenotypic alterations such as increased mammalian adaptation, reduced susceptibility to antiviral agents and reduced host antiviral response.

Recently, short beak and dwarfism syndrome (SBDS) had a sudden outbreak in Cherry Valley duck flocks, followed by Pekin ducks and mule ducks in various regions of mainland China. This widely spreading infectious disease was characterized by growth retardation, smaller beak and tarsus with high morbidity and low mortality rate. In this study, we identified and characterized virus from domestic Linwu sheldrakes (namely as HuN18) with SBDS. HuN18 isolates shared high nucleotide identity with novel goose parvovirus (N-GPV). A 5110-nucleotide full-length genome sequence of HuN18 was found with no deletion in ITR region. Alignment studies of HuN18 showed 96.8%-99.0% identity with other N-GPVs and 92.9%-96.3% identity with classic GPV. According to the recombination analysis, HuN18 showed the potential major parent was the N-GPV sdlc01 strain, the potential minor parent was the classical GPV Y strain, and the secondary potential minor parent was the SYG61v strain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of N-GPV in domestic Linwu sheldrakes with SBDS; these data provide evidence that attenuated live viruses are involved in genetic recombination with prevailing wild parvoviruses, which contributes to the novel emerging variants of waterfowl parvoviruses.

Hemagglutination (HA) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays are conventionally used for detection and identification of influenza viruses. HI assay is also used for detection of antibodies against influenza viruses. Primarily turkey or chicken erythrocytes [red blood cells (RBCs)] are used in these assays, as they are large, nucleated, and sediment fast, which makes it easy to determine the titer. Human influenza viruses agglutinate RBCs from chicken, human, and guinea pig, but not from horse. Human influenza viruses bind preferentially to sialic acid (SA) linked to galactose (Gal) by α 2, 6 linkage (SA α 2, 6-Gal), whereas avian influenza (AI) viruses bind preferentially to SA α 2, 3-Gal linkages. With this background, the present study was undertaken to study erythrocyte binding preferences and receptor specificities of AI viruses isolated from India.

Previous analyses of the Atlantic cod genome showed unique combinations of lacking and expanded number of genes for the immune system. The present study examined lysozyme activity, lysozyme gene distribution and expression in cod. Enzymatic assays employing specific bacterial lysozyme inhibitors provided evidence for presence of g-type, but unexpectedly not for c-type lysozyme activity. Database homology searches failed to identify any c-type lysozyme gene in the cod genome or in expressed sequence tags from cod. In contrast, we identified four g-type lysozyme genes (LygF1a-d) constitutively expressed, although differentially, in all cod organs examined. The active site glutamate residue is replaced by alanine in LygF1a, thus making it enzymatic inactive, while LygF1d was found in two active site variants carrying alanine or glutamate, respectively. In vitro and in vivo infection by the intracellular bacterium Francisella noatunensis gave a significantly reduced LygF1a and b expression but increased expression of the LygF1c and d genes as did also the interferon gamma (IFNγ) cytokine. These results demonstrate a lack of c-type lysozyme that is unprecedented among vertebrates. Our results further indicate that serial gene duplications have produced multiple differentially regulated cod g-type lysozymes with specialised functions potentially compensating for the lack of c-type lysozymes.

Chemical treatments of cereal seeds are used in the United Kingdom to prevent damage by a number of pests including the wheat bulb fly, which is a serious pest of winter wheat. The persistent organochlorine dieldrin was introduced in the 1950s as a seed treatment but caused the death of large numbers of grain eating birds and gave rise to unacceptable environmental contamination. The withdrawal of dieldrin as a seed treatment was made possible by the introduction of two less persistent organophosphate insecticides, chlorfenvinphos and carbophenothion. Although the introduction of these chemicals has been beneficial in reducing environmental contamination, some side-effects on wildlife have still been discernible and carbophenothion has now been withdrawn from use in Scotland owing to the deaths of wintering geese from carbophenothion poisoning. Subsequent laboratory studies have demonstrated that Anser geese are particularly susceptible to carbophenothion poisoning, and the underlying biochemical mechanism has been investigated. The fundamental problem of species variation in toxicity among the organophosphorus and carbamate pesticides which this investigation illustrates presents difficulties for registration authorities when they are considered for clearance for agricultural use. The implications of the environmental problems encountered with dieldrin, chlorfenvinphos and carbophenothion for the pre-clearance testing of new chemicals are discussed and the critical surveillance of the early years of commercial use of a chemical is recommended to support pre-clearance studies aimed at assessing the potential hazard to the environment.

FSH is a glycoprotein hormone secreted by the pituitary gland that is essential for gonadal development and reproductive function. In avian reproduction study, especially in avian reproduction hormone study, it is hindered by the lack of biologically active FSH. In order to overcome this shortcoming, we prepared recombinant goose FSH as a single chain molecule and tested its biological activities in the present study. Coding sequences for mature peptides of goose FSH α and β subunits were amplified from goose pituitary cDNA. A chimeric gene containing α and β subunit sequences linked by the hCG carboxyl terminal peptide coding sequence was constructed. The recombinant gene was inserted into the pcDNA3.1-Fc eukaryotic expression vector to form pcDNA-Fc-gFSHβ-CTP-α and then transfected into 293-F cells. A recombinant, single chain goose FSH was expressed and verified by SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis, and was purified using Protein A agarose affinity and gel filtration chromatography. Biological activity analysis results showed that the recombinant, chimeric goose FSH possesses the function of stimulating estradiol secretion and cell proliferation, in cultured chicken granulosa cells. These results indicated that bioactive, recombinant goose FSH has been successfully prepared in vitro. The recombinant goose FSH will have the potential of being used as a research tool for studying avian reproductive activities, and as a standard for developing avian FSH bioassays.

The SYG61v is an attenuated goose parvovirus (GPV) that has been used as a vaccine strain in China. The genome of SYG61v was sequenced to attempt to identify the genetic basis for the attenuation of this strain. The entire genome consists of 5102 nucleotides (nts), with four nt deletions compared to that of virulent strain B. The inverted terminal repeats (ITR) are 442 nts in length, of which 360 nts form a stem region, and 43 nts constitute the bubble region. Although mutations were observed throughout the ITR, no mismatch was found in the stem. Alignment with other pathogenic GPV strains (B, 82-0321, 06-0329, and YZ99-5) indicated that there are 10 and 11 amino acid mutations in the Rep1 and VP1 proteins of SYG61v, respectively. The complete genome of SYG61v was cloned into the pBluescript II vector and an infectious plasmid pSYG61v was generated. Infectious progeny virus was successfully rescued through transfection of the plasmid pSYG61v in embryonated goose eggs and yielded viral titers similar to its parental virus, as evaluated by ELD50.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide. This deficiency could be solved by preparing stable, edible, and absorbable iron food ingredients using environmentally friendly methods. This study investigated enzymatic hydrolysis and microencapsulation process of goose blood. The physicochemical properties, stabilities of the microencapsulated goose blood hydrolysate (MGBH) and a supplement for rats with IDA were also evaluated. The results showed that the synergetic hydrolytic action of neutrase and alkaline protease significantly increased the heme-releasing efficiency. The heme was then microencapsulated using sodium caseinate, maltodextrin and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as the edible wall material, and the encapsulation efficiency of the product reached 98.64%. Meanwhile, favorable thermal, storage and light stabilities were observed for the microencapsulation. It was found that MGBH can significantly improve the body weight and hematological parameters of IDA Wistar rat.

The objective of this study was to unravelling the possible mechanism underlying drip loss and identify the protein markers associated with water holding capacity (WHC) of meat. Pectoralis major muscles from geese were assigned to high and low drip loss groups. The physio-chemical properties and proteome profiles were compared between these two groups. Label-free quantitative mass spectrometry was applied to investigate the differentially expressed proteins, and the results were confirmed with parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). 21 differential proteins were identified in abundance between high and low drip loss groups, and they fall generally into the structural proteins, metabolic enzymes, antioxidant enzymes and stress response proteins. The results may provide a perspective to the discovery of new biomarkers for drip loss.

A 5-year-old sexually intact male Toulouse goose ( Anser anser domesticus) was presented for ataxia, polyuria, and polydipsia. The goose was cachectic and exhibited head tremors. Results of plasma biochemical analysis and point-of-care glucometry revealed persistent hyperglycemia. Despite supportive care and oral glipizide, the goose died within 48 hours of presentation. Necropsy revealed severe pancreatic atrophy and fibrosis with regionally extensive cerebellar encephalomalacia and generalized Purkinje cell degeneration and necrosis. On a wet basis, hepatic zinc concentration was determined to be twice the reference interval by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Based on these findings, the pancreatic insufficiency with secondary diabetes mellitus was attributed to chronic zinc toxicosis. Despite birds' relative resistance to high blood glucose concentrations, prolonged hyperglycemia is suspected to have caused selective Purkinje cell degeneration and necrosis by glial activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and glutamate toxicity, which resulted in the clinically observed motor deficits. This is consistent with experimental diabetic rat models. This case highlights the need for further investigation of the complex pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus in birds.

Efficiency of freezing method, worked out for the White Italian gander semen was evaluated by comparing motility, morphology and fertilizing ability of spermatozoa in fresh and frozen-thawed semen. A part of pooled semen, collected from 25 White Italian ganders by dorso-abdominal massage was used immediately for artificial insemination of 10 geese (the control group) with a dose of 80 microl. This insemination was performed six times at weekly intervals. The remainder of the semen was diluted 1:0.5 (v/v) with EK diluent, equilibrated for 15 min at +4 degrees C, mixed with 6% (v/v) of dimethylformamide (DMF) and frozen to -140 degrees C at a rate of 60 degrees C/min. Frozen semen was thawed in a 60 degrees C water-bath and inseminated twice weekly in a dose of 100 microl (10 females of the experimental group, 12 inseminations were made). The freezing process affected spermatozoa motility and morphology, but had no effect on their fertilizing ability. Positive movement was observed in 50-60% of the spermatozoa in fresh semen and about 40% of the frozen-thawed cells. The average percentage of total live and live normal spermatozoa decreased due to freezing from 92.2 to 68.4% and from 34.7 to 14.1%, respectively. After the fresh semen insemination with average 12 million of the live normal spermatozoa per week average fertility was 88.24%; hatchability of set eggs was 80.88% and hatchability of fertile eggs was 91.67%. For frozen-thawed semen inseminated with average 9.5 million of the undamaged spermatozoa per week, the average fertility and hatchability rate was 83.78, 73.87, and 88.17%, respectively. Fecundity rates obtained after insemination with the frozen-thawed gander semen allow for the application of the freezing technique into breeding practice, in place of natural mating or to assist natural mating in periods of lowered fertility level.

The regenerating blood of geese injected with phenylhydrazine was subjected to large scale, zonal centrifugation through density gradients of Ficoll. In this way, erythroid cells were fractionated according to their respective stages of development. Highly enriched fractions were obtained, containing cells that were well preserved as assessed by both light and electron microscopy. The separated cells exhibited ribosome density and nucleic acid and protein staining patterns typically associated with erythrocyte differentiation. Morphometric analysis of nuclei indicated that despite an apparent net increase in the amount of compact chromatin during development, comparatively little difference existed between the volumes of condensed chromatin present in immature and mature cells. Instead, there was a three fold decrease in nuclear volume between young erythroblasts and reticulocytes, coupled with a concomitant decrease in the volume occupied by dispersed chromatin, RNP and nucleoli. These observations are discussed in relation to molecular changes associated with nuclear differentiation in erythroid cells.

The aim of this work was to determine the microorganisms present and to investigate their metabolites that cause spoilage of many goose sausages produced in Friuli, a northeast region of Italy. The defect was observed by sensorial analysis using the "needle probing" technique; the spoiled sausages were unsafe and not marketable. Despite the addition of starter, the microorganisms, particularly enterococci and Enterobacteriaceae, grew during ripening and produced a large amount of biogenic amines; therefore, these sausages represented a risk to consumers. The production of those compounds was confirmed in vitro. Furthermore, a second cause of spoilage was attributed to moulds that grew during ripening; the fungi grew between the meat and casing, producing a large amount of total volatile nitrogen, and consequently an ammonia smell was present either in the ripening area or in the sausages. This is the first description of this type of defect in goose sausages.

Using the rapid glass plate method, the Newcastle disease virus strain MET95 showed much weaker haemagglutination (HA) activity for chicken erythrocytes than 69 other Newcastle disease viruses, including 56 field strains isolated from chickens reared in Japan between 1988 and 2001. Using erythrocytes from other avian species, only the MET95 strain failed to show HA activity for erythrocytes from ducks, geese or pigeons. The haemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein of the MET95 strain was shown to have unique substitutions of isoleucine for thereonine and leucine at amino acide residues 216 and 552. It is suggested that these two substitutions might relate to the unique HA activity of the MET95 strain. This HA activity may be a useful marker for this strain.

Increased mortality was observed in a group of 2-3-week old goslings. At post mortem examination, gross lesions included congestion and haemorrhages in the viscera. Histopathological lesions included generalised congestion of tissues with multifocal bacterial colonies, an acute septic fibrinoid splenitis, and an acute septic hepatitis, all consistent with acute septicaemia. Gram-stained sections of liver and lung confirmed the presence of Gram-positive bacteria and Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (Streptococcus bovis biotype II/2) was isolated in pure growth from two of the goslings, and in mixed growth from a third.

The microscope is the most ubiquitous instrument in the clinical laboratory. We discuss improvements in its use, in terms of "front-end" automation of specimen handling and "back-end" automation of image analysis: automated intelligent microscopy. Examples of spatial and spectral differentiation illustrate the potential of this automated version of microscopy as a useful tool with very powerful analytical capabilities for the clinical laboratory.

The transmission of avian H5N1 influenza viruses to 18 humans in Hong Kong in 1997 with six deaths established that avian influenza viruses can transmit to and cause lethal infection in humans. This report characterizes the antigenic and biological properties of the H5N1 influenza viruses isolated from chickens, ducks, and geese from farms and poultry markets in Hong Kong during 1997 and compares them with those of virus isolated from the index human case. Each of the H5N1 viruses from Hong Kong poultry markets that were tested were lethal in chickens, possessed polybasic amino acids at the carboxy-terminus of HA1, and by definition were highly pathogenic in poultry. The available nonpathogenic H5 influenza viruses and the pathogenic H5N1 virus from Hong Kong were analyzed with monoclonal antibodies prepared to A/chicken/Pennsylvania/1370/83 (H5N2). The analysis revealed limited antigenic drift in 15 years and established that monoclonal antibodies are useful reagents for identification and antigenic analysis of avian strains that may transmit to humans in the future. One of the monoclonal antibodies permitted separation of the H5N1 influenza viruses from poultry into two groups that correlated with the presence or absence of a carbohydrate at residue 158 adjacent to the receptor binding site on HA. The H5N1 viruses examined replicated in geese, pigs, rats, and mice, but to only a very limited extent in ducks. It is noteworthy that all infected geese shed virus and that the H5N1 viruses caused disease signs and death in a portion (3 of 16) of the geese, with evidence of systemic spread to the brain. The tropism for geese is unusual and may provide insight into the origin of these viruses. In mice, the H5N1 virus caused lethal pneumonia and spread systemically to the brain. Mice would thus provide an ideal model system for studying immune responses and pathogenesis. Transmission experiments in chickens revealed that the H5N1 viruses are spread by fecal-oral transmission rather than by aerosol, and that the viruses are inactivated by drying of feces at ambient temperature. However, infectivity is maintained for at least 4 days in wet feces at 25 degreesC. There were differences in the morphology of the H5N1 viruses isolated from birds and humans. The perpetuation of H5N1 influenza viruses in the poultry markets in Hong Kong and the transmission of these viruses to humans emphasize the importance of these markets in the epidemiology of influenza. The poultry markets are of critical importance in the perpetuation and transmission of influenza viruses to other avian species and to mammals, including humans.

Infection of clinically susceptible ducks, including cherry valley and Muscovy ducks, with a novel goose parvovirus (GPV)-related virus (N-GPV) can result in beak atrophy and dwarfism syndrome (BADS). To obtain new insights into the host range and pathogenic potential of this novel waterfowl parvovirus, cherry valley ducklings (n=20) were experimentally infected with N-GPV strain SDLC01. An equal number of ducklings served as uninfected controls. The appearance of clinical signs, histopathological changes, viral shedding, and seroconversion was monitored for 20 days post-infection. Infection status of all ducks was monitored using indirect ELISA, virus neutralization test, nested PCR, clinical indicators, and microscopic examination. Three ducks developed the typical clinical, gross, and histological changes of BADS. By study day 6, the infected ducks had seroconverted to N-GPV. The antibodies raised were neutralizing against the SDLC01 strain in vitro. Here we successfully developed an experimental infection model for studying the pathogenicity and role of N-GPV in BADS.

Crude cell-free extracts isolated from the uropygial glands of goose catalyzed the carboxylation of propionyl-CoA but not acetyl-CoA. However, a partially purified preparation catalyzed the carboxylation of both substrates and the characteristics of this carboxylase were similar to those reported for chicken liver carboxylase. The Km and Vmax for the carboxylation of either acetyl-CoA or propionyl-CoA were 1.5 times 10- minus-5 M and 0.8 mumol per min per mg, respectively. In the crude extracts an inhibitor of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity was detected. The inhibitor was partially purified and identified as a protein that catalyzed the rapid decarboxylation of malonyl-CoA. This enzyme was avidin-insenitive and highly specific for malonyl-CoA with very low rates of decarboxylation for methylmalonyl-CoA and malonic acid. Vmax and Km for malonyl-CoA decarboxylation, at the pH optimum of 9.5, were 12.5 mumol per min per mg and 8 times 10- minus-4 M, respectively. The relative activities of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase and malonyl-CoA decarboxylase were about 4 mumol per min per gland and 70 mumoles per min per gland, respectively. Therefore acetyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA should be the major primer and elongating agent, respectively, present in the gland. The major fatty acid formed from these precursors by the fatty acid synthetase of the gland would be 2,4,6,8-tetramethyl-decanoic acid which is known to be the major fatty acid of the gland (Buckner, J. S. and Kolattukudy, P. E. (1975), Biochemistry, following paper). Therefore it is concluded that the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase controls fatty acid synthesis in this gland.

In May 2016, highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of the subtype A/H5N1 was detected in Cameroon in an industrial poultry farm at Mvog-Betsi, Yaoundé (Centre region), with a recorded sudden increase of deaths among chickens, and an overall mortality rate of 75%. The virus spread further and caused new outbreaks in some parts of the country. In total, 21 outbreaks were confirmed from May 2016 to March 2017 (six in the Centre, six in the West, eight in the South and one in the Adamaoua regions). This resulted in an estimated total loss of 138,252 birds (44,451 deaths due to infection and 93,801 stamped out). Only domestic birds (chickens, ducks and geese) were affected in farms as well as in poultry markets. The outbreaks occurred in three waves, the first from May to June 2016, the second in September 2016 and the last wave in March 2017. The topology of the phylogeny based on the haemagglutinin gene segment indicated that the causative H5N1 viruses fall within the genetic clade 2.3.2.1c, within the same group as the A/H5N1 viruses collected in Niger in 2015 and 2016. More importantly, the gene constellation of four representative viruses showed evidence of H5N1/H9N2 intra-clade reassortment. Additional epidemiological and genetic data from affected countries in West Africa are needed to better trace the origin, spread and evolution of A/H5N1 in Cameroon. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS HPAI A/H5N1 was detected in May 2016 in domestic chickens in Yaoundé-Cameroon. Twenty-one outbreaks in total were confirmed from May 2016 to March 2017. The causative H5N1 viruses fall within the genetic clade 2.3.2.1c. The viral gene constellation showed evidence of H5N1/H9N2 intra-clade reassortment.

1. The eggshell cuticle is the proteinaceous outermost layer of the eggshell which regulates water exchange and protects against entry of micro-organisms. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that the cuticle may also reduce microbial contamination by providing a chemical defence. 2. Outer eggshell and cuticle protein was extracted from domestic chicken (Gallus gallus), duck (Anas platyrhynchos) and goose (Anser anser) eggs by HCl and urea treatment, respectively. Antimicrobial activity of the extracts against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was evaluated. 3. C-type lysozyme, ovotransferrin and ovocalyxin-32 were identified in all extracts by Western blotting. All extracts from all species demonstrated lysozyme enzymatic activity. Immobilised c-type lysozyme retained some enzymatic activity. Protein extracts demonstrated activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis suggesting the action of antimicrobial proteins in addition to lysozyme. 4. The results suggest that the antimicrobial outer eggshell and cuticle proteins present in a number of avian species may be a mechanism which enhances avian reproductive success.

Avian and mammalian sera were found to contain an enzyme activity degrading 2-5A oligonucleotides. The most extensive degradation of the A2' p5' A was observed in chicken serum. Degradation of this compound is not affected by the presence of cAMP, dsRNA, Mg2+, but is significantly inhibited by EDTA. The enzyme activity described is not inactivated by heating to 56 degrees C for 30 min. The 5-mU3' p5' A has also been degraded in chicken serum.

Fatty acid synthase from the uropygial gland of goose was inactivated by iodoacetamide with a second-order rate constant of 1.3 M-1 S-1 at pH 6.0 and 25 degrees C. Of the seven component activities of the synthase, only the condensation activity was significantly inhibited by iodoacetamide modification. Since preincubation of the enzyme with acetyl-CoA, but not with malonyl-CoA, protected the enzyme from inactivation by iodoacetamide, it is suggested that iodoacetamide probably modified the primer-binding thiol group at the condensation active site. Determination of the stoichiometry of modification was done using [1-14C]iodoacetamide that was purified by high-performance liquid chromatography. Graphical analysis of the data showed that binding of 1.2 carboxamidomethyl groups per subunit of fatty acid synthase would result in complete inhibition of the enzyme activity, suggesting that there is one condensation domain per subunit of fatty acid synthase. Analysis of the tryptic peptide map of the enzyme that was modified with [1-14C]iodoacetamide in the presence and absence of acetyl-CoA revealed that acetyl-CoA prevented the labeling of a major radioactive peptide and a minor radioactive peptide. These two peptides were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography. Amino acid analysis of these two peptides revealed that the major radioactive peptide contained S-carboxymethylcysteine while the minor radioactive peptide did not. However, the latter peptide contained beta-alanine, suggesting that this peptide was from the acyl carrier protein segment of fatty acid synthase and that the iodoacetamide treatment resulted in modification of the pantetheine thiol, although to a lower extent than the primer-binding thiol. The sequence of the primer-binding active site peptide from the condensation domain was H2N-Gly-Pro-Ser-Leu-Ser-Ile-Asp- Thr-Ala-Cys(carboxamidomethyl)-X-Ser-Ser-Leu-Met-Ala-Leu-Glu-Asn-A la-Tyr-Lys- COOH, the first reported sequence of the condensation active site from a vertebrate fatty acid synthase. The acyl carrier protein segment showed extensive sequence homology with the acyl carrier protein of Escherichia coli, particularly in the vicinity of the phosphopantetheine attachment, and the sequence was H2N-Asp-Val-Ser-Ser-Leu- Asn-Ala-Asp-Ser-Thr-Leu-Ala-Asp-Leu-Gly-Leu-Asp-Ser(4'-phosphopanteth ein e) -Leu-Met-Gly-Val-Glu-Val-Arg-COOH.

After 11 consecutive months of control, the Mekong Delta in Viet Nam experienced a wave of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 outbreaks on small holder poultry farms from December 2006 to January 2007. We conducted a retrospective matched case-control study to investigate farm- and flock-level risk factors for outbreak occurrence during this period. Twenty-two case farms were selected from those where clinical signs consistent with HPAI H5N1 had been present and HPAI H5N1 had been confirmed with a positive real-time PCR test from samples obtained from affected birds. For every case farm enrolled, two control farms were selected matched on time of outbreak occurrence, farm location and species. Veterinarians conducted interviews with farmers, to collect information on household demographics, farm characteristics, husbandry practices, trading practices, poultry health, vaccination and biosecurity. Exact stratified logistic regression models were used to assess putative risk factors associated with a flock having or not having a HPAI outbreak. Nested analyses were also performed, restricted to subsets of farms using scavenging, confinement or supplementary feeding practices. Risk of an outbreak of HPAI H5N1 was increased in flocks that had received no vaccination (odds ratio (OR)=20.2; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0, +infinity) or only one vaccination (OR=85.2; 95% CI: 6.5, +infinity) of flocks compared to two vaccinations, and in flocks on farms that had family and friends visiting (OR=8.2; 95% CI: 1.0, +infinity) and geese present (OR=11.5; 95% CI: 1.1, +infinity). The subset analysis using only flocks that scavenged showed that sharing of scavenging areas with flocks from other farms was associated with increased risk of an outbreak (OR=10.9; 95% CI: 1.4, 492.9). We conclude that none or only one vaccination, visitors to farms, the presence of geese on farms and sharing of scavenging areas with ducks from other farms increase the risk of HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in poultry flocks in Viet Nam.

The mechanism of phytoestrogen action in gonadal cells of ganders has not been elucidated. The aim of the study was to investigate in Biłgoraj ganders the possibility of phytoestrogen action via estrogen or androgen receptors or via protein tyrosine kinase pathways in Leydig cells. Genistein and daidzein (5 and 50 microM) as well as equol (50 microM) inhibited testosterone (T) secretion by incubated Leydig cells (1x10(5)/ml; 20 h; 37 degrees C). The effects of hydroxytamoxifen (estrogen receptor inhibitor) and cyproterone acetate (androgen receptor antagonist) on phytoestrogen inhibition of T release by Leydig cells were not observed. Lavendustin A (protein tyrosine kinases inhibitor) did not change T production. The influence of phytoestrogens seems not to be conducted via estrogen and androgen receptors or protein tyrosine kinases system in these cells, but further studies are required to completely examine the mechanism of phytoestrogens action in testes of ganders.

Epidemiologic evaluations were made of farm personnel on vesicular stomatitis-affected premises along the front range of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado during the 1982 epizootic. A similar antibody prevalence was noted to that of veterinarians and research and regulatory personnel who were involved with the same epizootic. Risk of infection resulted from intimate physical contact with infected horses or cows. Incidence and infection rates in horses were 45%; rates in cows were much lower, only 5%. Some epidemiologic clues were gained by a detailed study of an equine ranch. The pasture was incriminated as the area of highest risk, where 100% infection rates were noted. Horses in open pens and barns were at lower risk. Severe clinical disease in horses resulted in higher neutralizing antibody titers than inapparent or mild infection. Maternal antibody was detected in foals up to 4 months of age, and the level of antibody in the foal was a reflection of the dam's antibody level.

Because sleep comprises one-third of a person's life, using an optimal pillow for appropriate neck support to maintain cervical curve may contribute to improve quality of sleep. Design of orthopedic pillow conforms to orthopedic guidelines to ensure the right support of the cervical curve. The aim of this study was to investigate effect of different pillow shape and content on cervical curve, pillow temperature, and pillow comfort. A feather pillow is regarded as a standard pillow, and a memory foam pillow is one of the most popular pillows among pillow users. We, therefore, compared these two pillows with an orthopedic pillow. Twenty healthy subjects (10 men and 10 women; age range, 21-30 years) participated in the study. Each subject was asked to assume the supine position with 3 different pillows for 30 minute in each trial and then cervical curve, pillow temperature, and pillow comfort were measured. When comparing the cervical curve of the 3 different pillows, that of the orthopedic pillow was significantly higher than that of the other 2 pillows (p < 0.001). The degree of temperature increase was significantly lower for the orthopedic pillow than for the memory foam and feather pillows (p < 0.001). The visual analog scale (VAS) score of pillow comfort was significantly higher in orthopedic pillow than the other 2 pillows. This study shows that pillow shape and content plays a crucial role in cervical curve, pillow temperature, and pillow comfort and orthopedic pillow may be an optimal pillow for sleep quality.

The ultrastructure of eosinophil granules from various aquatic and terrestrial birds has been described. Granules of three basic types were found. The first had a crystalline internum and was found only in the order Anseriformes, which included the black-necked screamer, ducks, geese and swans. The crystals occurred in three morphological forms. The second and least common granule examined contained a non-crystalline internum which was either homogeneous or composed of microfilaments or microtubules. The largest and most common group of birds had a homogenous granule with no internum shown. Homogeneous granules occurred less frequently than did those with interna.

Twenty-nine avian avulavirus-1 viruses (AAvV-1s) from healthy domestic and wild ducks, geese and black swans collected in Pakistan between 2014-2017 have been pathotyped and genetically characterized. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that 21 of the isolates belonged to sub-genotype VIIi, whereas eight isolates were highly similar to vaccine-like viruses of genotype II. In addition to confirming the continued presence of sub-genotype VIIi AAvV-1s in Pakistan, this study identifies the probable spill-over of vaccine-like viruses from vaccinated poultry to wild and domestic waterfowl and, as such, has important implications for the control and management of Newcastle disease in Pakistan.

Electric stimulation of paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus results in intensification of RNA synthesis in rat brain. Content of acid proteins and RNA in liver and brain chromatin of geese changes in the period of sexual activity controlled by hypothalamus. With long introduction of hydrocortisone content of non-histone proteins of chromatine and RNA as well as total content of RNA in rat liver cells increases. These and other facts confirm the supposition that the central nervous system has an influence on the function of organs and tissues by means of genetical apparatus of cells.

Waterfowl parvoviruses cause serious loss in geese and ducks production. Goose parvovirus (GPV) is infectious for geese and ducks while Muscovy duck parvovirus (MDPV) infects Muscovy ducks only. So far, for these viruses' sensitive detection polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) were applied. However, there was no molecular biology method for both waterfowl parvoviruses detection and quantification which could unify the laboratory procedures. The level of GPV and MDPV replication and distribution plays a significant role in the parvoviral infection progress and is strictly correlated to clinical symptoms. Meanwhile, experiments conducted previously on GPV distribution in geese, performed as animal trial, did not involve epidemiological data from the disease field cases. The study on the correlation between age, clinical symptoms and viral DNA copy number may be benefitable in understanding the GPV and MDPV infection. Such data may also aid in determination of the stage and severity of the infection with parvoviruses. Therefore the aim of this study was to develop quantitative real-time PCR for parallel detection of GPV and MDPV in geese and Muscovy ducks and to determine the correlation between the age of the infected birds, clinical symptoms and DNA copy number for the estimation of the disease stage or severity.

Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a zoonotic pathogen that often causes diarrhea, respiratory diseases or septicemia in animals. Fluoroquinolones are antimicrobial agents used to treat pathogenic E. coli infections. In this study, 1,221 E. coli strains were isolated between March, 2011 and February, 2014. The results of the antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed a high prevalence of quinolone resistance. The antimicrobial resistance rates of these E. coli isolates to nalidixic acid (NAL) were 72.0% in swine, 81.9% in chickens, 81.0% in turkeys, 64.0% in ducks and 73.2% in geese. Among these isolates, the positive rate for the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) determinant was 14.8% (181/1,221); the detection rate for qnrS1 was the highest (10.2%), followed by aac(6')-Ib-cr (4.5%) and qnrB2 (0.3%). The quinolone-resistance determining regions (QRDRs) analysis for the PMQR-positive isolates showed that the strains with mutations at codon 83 or 87 in GyrA were resistant to NAL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of occurrence of qnrB2, qnrS1 and aac(6')-Ib-cr genes and high frequency (56.4%; 102/181) of mutation in gyrA or parC among PMQR-positive E. coli strains derived from diseased animals in Taiwan.

The immunological cross-reactivities of three conformationally specific monoclonal antibodies to distinct epitopes on human plasminogen toward plasminogens purified from 14 additional species have been examined. Antibody 10-F-1, which is produced against an epitope on the kringle 4 region of human plasminogen, shows a high degree (greater than 80%) of cross-reactivity against baboon, goat, monkey, ovine, and rabbit plasminogens; more limited (20-50%) cross-reactivity against bovine, equine, goose, guinea pig, mouse, rat, and porcine plasminogens; and little comparable cross-reactivity against canine and chicken plasminogens. Antibody 10-H-2, generated to an epitope of the kringles 1-3 region of human plasminogen, shows extensive cross-reactivity (72%) only toward monkey plasminogen, more limited (22-35%) cross-reactivity toward equine and rabbit plasminogens, and much less cross-reactivity toward any other of the above plasminogens. Antibody 10-V-1, also produced against an epitope on the kringle 1-3 region of human plasminogen, which is distinct from the 10-H-2 epitope, shows extensive cross-reactivity (72-100%) with baboon, monkey, and rabbit plasminogens; more limited cross-reactivity with equine (48%) and mouse (28%) plasminogens; and a low level of such reactivity with the remaining plasminogens. These studies show that the extent of interspecies cross-reactivity of various plasminogens greatly depends upon the epitope in question. The K4 region of these molecules appears more extensively conserved than the K1-3 region, at least in regard to the particular epitopes examined in this study.

One hundred eighty-three toluidine blue O-stained necropsy lung imprint smears from different avian species were examined microscopically for Pneumocystis carinii. No cyst forms of the organism could be identified. Seventy-eight serum samples from a total of 155 chickens were examined by a competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for antibodies to P. carinii; 53 serum samples were from individual chickens, and 25 samples were pools of sera from two to five chickens. Diluted 1:50, the 78 serum samples showed a specific ELISA-inhibition of 4% to 56% (the 95% confidence limit being 25% to 30% inhibition). Diluted 1:50, nine serum pools representing 34 chickens and 17 of the 53 individual serum samples (32.1%) showed an inhibition greater than 30%. No specific pneumocyst DNA could be detected in serum from 13 of the 53 chickens using polymerase chain reaction and dihydrofolate reductase gene as a specific probe. Specific antibodies to a 116,000-molecular-weight antigen of rat pneumocysts were shown in two (13.3%) of 15 individual chicken serum samples. The results indicate that P. carinii organisms do not commonly reside in the lungs of birds, although some birds may be exposed to external sources of organisms.

Sudden increase in mortality was observed in 2 different flocks of mature breeder geese fed green onions. At necropsy, birds had pale epicardium with random petechiation, sanguinous fluid accumulation in the pericardial sac, and mild swelling of the liver and spleen. Histologically, there was accumulation of hemosiderin in hepatocytes, Kupffer cells of the liver, macrophages, and renal tubules. There was also moderate to severe hepatic necrosis, vacuolation of hepatocytes, splenitis, and renal tubular nephrosis. To assess the effects of green onion ingestion, 2 feeding trials were carried out in 3 mature White Chinese geese. In the first trial, onions were thoroughly mixed with pellet maintenance ration. In the second trial, onions were offered in a separate trough from the pelleted diet. During the 21 days of experiments, the red blood cell count and hematocrit decreased, whereas the polychromasia and reticulocyte estimate increased. The blood changes were more marked in birds from the second feeding trial. Gross and histologic changes were similar in both trials. Mild swelling and severe darkening of the liver were the only significant findings at necropsy. Histologically, the liver looked similar to that seen from the field outbreak. The liver contained moderate amounts of hemosiderin in the hepatocytes and Kupffer cells, and had centrolobular necrosis and vacuolation of hepatocytes. This experimental study demonstrated that anemia and liver pathology could be caused by ingestion of onions. Furthermore, Heinz bodies are not a consistent finding in the blood of geese fed onions.

Goose circovirus (GoCV), a potential immuno-suppressive virus, was detected in a sample collected from Yongkang avian influenza (AI) case in Zhejiang Province of eastern China. Further, epidemiological investigation showed that, four farms located in the two major rearing areas of Yongkang and Xiangshan out of eight in Zhejiang Province were positive for GoCV. However, the geese in these GoCV positive farms exhibited no apparent clinical abnormality. The complete genomes of ten isolates from Yongkang AI case (yk1) and other four different farms were sequenced. They had 90.8-99.9% nucleotide (nt) identity with each other and had 91.3-95.8% nt identity to that of the Taiwan and German strains. Genome analysis showed that the GoCVs isolated in Zhejiang Province possessed common features of circovirus, including the potentially replication-associated stem-loop structure, the Rep protein motifs, etc. Highly variable region was also detected between nt27 and nt72 in the intergenic region. Phylogenetic analysis showed that GoCVs could be divided into three distinct genetic groups, where groups I and II could each be further divided into two subgroups (I1, I2 and II1, II2, respectively). No obvious characteristic was found between subclinical strains and clinical strains. However, both the phylogenetic result and analysis of highly variable region revealed that GoCVs isolated from different locations had some geographically dependent characteristics. This is the first epidemiological investigation of GoCV in the mainland of China.

A relatively large number of animal models of candidosis exist in which the efficacy of antifungal substances can be evaluated. These include models of candidosis of the skin, gastrointestinal tract, genital system, and internal organs in a variety of animal species. The efficacy of ketoconazole administered orally and topically was evaluated; when given orally in relatively low doses, ketoconazole was found to be efficacious in all of the experimental models used. Scanning and transmission electron micrographs of infected tissue demonstrated the rapidity with which Candida albicans was eradicated from the host after administration of ketoconazole.

Both Tembusu virus (TMUV) and goose parvovirus (GPV) are causative agents of goose disease. However, the host immune response of the goose against these two different categories of virus has not been well documented. Here, we compared the clinical symptoms and pathological characteristics, antigen distribution and intensity, and expression of immune-related genes in TMUV- and GPV- infected goose. The immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrated that GPV was primarily located in the liver, lung, small intestine, and rectum, while TMUV was situated in the liver, brain, spleen, and small intestine. The induction of IFNγ and proinflammatory cytokines is highly associated with the distribution profiles of antigen and CD8α+ molecules. The effector function of CD8 T cells may be accomplished by the secretion of IFNγ together with high expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL1 and IL6. Remarkably, significant increases in the transcription of immune genes were observed after infection, which suggested that both GPV and TMUV can effectively induce immune response in goose PMBCs. This study will provide fundamental information for goose molecular immunology in defending against pandemic viruses.

The most important virus-induced diseases associated with heavy losses in the domestic goose are Derzsy's disease which is caused by a goose parvovirus and duck plague (duck viral enteritis) which is caused by an avian herpesvirus. Both diseases still occur but can be prevented by timely vaccinations. Antibodies against Influenza A viruses of the subtypes H1, H5, and H7 as well as against avian paramyxoviruses of the serogroups 4, 6, and 8, respectively, were not detected in any of the examined sera. However, antibodies against paramyxovirus type 1 were detected in sera of one source. Haemagglutination inhibition or neutralizing antibodies against avian adenoviruses (EDS76 virus and goose adenovirus of the serotypes 1, 2, and 3) were quite often detected. Based on the present knowledge their pathogenic potential is minor. Neutralizing antibodies against a reovirus originating from Muscovy ducks and against a chicken reovirus (strain U Con S 1133) were quite frequently detected. In 35 of 564 examined geese sera hepatitis B virus was found.

Two goose-type lysozymes (designated as MGgLYZ1 and MGgLYZ2) were identified from the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. MGgLYZ1 mRNA was widely expressed in the examined tissues and responded sensitively to bacterial challenge in hemocytes, while MGgLYZ2 mRNA was predominately expressed and performed its functions in hepatopancreas. However, immunolocalization analysis showed that both these lysozymes were expressed in all examined tissues with the exception of adductor muscle. Recombinant MGgLYZ1 and MGgLYZ2 could inhibit the growth of several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and they both showed the highest activity against Pseudomonas putida with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.95-1.91 µM and 1.20-2.40 µM, respectively. Protein sequences analysis revealed that MGgLYZ2 had lower isoelectric point and less protease cutting sites than MGgLYZ1. Recombinant MGgLYZ2 exhibited relative high activity at acidic pH of 4-5, while MGgLYZ1 have an optimum pH of 6. These results indicated MGgLYZ2 adapted to acidic environment and perhaps play an important role in digestion. Genomic structure analysis suggested that both MGgLYZ1 and MGgLYZ2 genes are composed of six exons with same length and five introns, indicating these genes were conserved and might originate from gene duplication during the evolution. Selection pressure analysis showed that MGgLYZ1 was under nearly neutral selection while MGgLYZ2 evolved under positive selection pressure with three positively selected amino acid residues (Y(102), L(200) and S(202)) detected in the mature peptide. All these findings suggested MGgLYZ2 perhaps served as a digestive lysozyme under positive selection pressure during the evolution while MGgLYZ1 was mainly involved in innate immune responses.

In recent years, investigations of Toxoplasma gondii infection in poultry (chickens, ducks, and geese) have been reported worldwide, including China. However, little is known about the prevalence of T. gondii infection in poultry in northeastern China. Therefore, the present study was performed to determine the prevalence of T. gondii infection in slaughtered chickens, ducks, and geese in Shenyang, northeastern China.

The aim of this study was to determine the infectious agents isolated from infection - suspected geese sent for the diagnostic examination to National Veterinary Research Institute. The birds were sent from goose flocks localized in different parts of Poland. Totally, 1,013 birds from 122 flocks were examined. The presence of goose parvovirus (GPV), goose haemorrhagic polyomavirus (GHPV), and goose circovirus (GoCV) was detected by triplex PCR. The presence of GPV DNA was shown in 36 flocks. The disease was most frequently diagnosed in goslings aging 3.5 weeks (ten flocks), and 2.5 weeks (six flocks). The analysis of the nucleotide sequence of VP1 encoding region has shown close similarity of Polish GPV strains within the group which ranged from 92% to 100%. Moreover, the similarity level of these strains with GPV isolated in Europe was from 91.3% to 100%. The occurrence of GoCV DNA was shown in 25 goose flocks. The presence of GoCV DNA was found among geese aged from 2 to 6 weeks, but predominantly in those aging 3.5 (three flocks) and 5 weeks (five flocks). The sequence analysis of PCR products from the sequenced region of ORFC1 capsid protein of GoCV has shown that Polish isolates share from 85% to 91% similarity with the sequences of GoCV strains isolated in other countries. The presence of DNA of GHPV was found in 3-week-old geese. During the last 2 years the presence of GHPV was confirmed in three flocks of goslings at the age from 3 to 3.5 weeks. During the last 12 years the occurrence of co-infection with GPV and GoCV was detected in six flocks aging from 5 to 6 weeks.

Alkhumra hemorrhagic fever virus (AHFV) is an emerging flavivirus that was discovered in 1994-1995 in Saudi Arabia. Clinical manifestations of AHFV infection include hemorrhagic fever, hepatitis, and encephalitis, with a reported mortality rate as high as 25 %. Biological characteristics of this virus have not been well defined. Agglutination of erythrocytes (hemagglutination) is a laboratory tool for studying the attachment of viruses to cellular receptors. The envelope protein contains sites for attachment to host receptors to initiate the process of infection and is thus an essential component of the virion. In the present study, we examined the ability of AHFV to agglutinate erythrocytes of 13 mammalian and avian species (human group O+, camel, cow, sheep, goat, rabbit, guinea pig, mouse, rat, chicken, duck, goose and turkey) with and without trypsin-treatment. Without trypsin treatment, AHFV failed to agglutinate erythrocytes of all examined species. Following trypsin treatment, AHFV agglutinated erythrocytes of five species, namely, goose, human group O+, rat, guinea pig, and mouse, in descending order of sensitivity. This trypsin-dependent hemagglutination test has potential for use in serological and functional studies of AHFV.

Strain T1E, isolated and identified as Brevibacillus thermoruber, and evolutionally distant from the known keratinolytic isolates, proved to have feather-degrading ability. During the 7-day fermentation period, T1E consumed 10 g/l native goose feathers as the sole source of carbon and energy at 50 degrees C under aerobic conditions. The isolate secreted a thermostable, keratinolytic protease, which exhibited activity optimally at pH 6.5, whilst it was inhibited at alkaline pH. The keratin cleavage and catabolism resulted in the accumulation of free aspartic acid and soluble peptides with maximum values of 31.6 and 720 mg/l, respectively. The majority of the fermentation end-products were found to be small oligopeptides with an average molecular mass of 2275 Da.

The detrimental effects of West Nile virus (WNV) have been well characterized in several taxonomic groups of North American birds, such as corvids and raptors. Relatively less is known about the virus' effects in waterfowl species, many of which are abundant in North America and occupy habitats, for example wetlands and marshes, likely to harbour dense mosquito populations. In two successive years, outbreaks of WNV-associated disease were observed in waterfowl at a rehabilitation centre. In the present report, clinical and pathological findings are provided for seven mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and one Canada goose (Branta canadensis) that developed acute disease and either died or were killed humanely. The most severe and consistent microscopic lesion in mallards was myocardial degeneration and coagulative necrosis consistent with acute heart failure. The Canada goose had necrotizing myocarditis. Other lesions included pulmonary perivascular oedema, lymphoplasmacytic hepatitis, and splenic and bursal lymphoid depletion. WNV infection was confirmed using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining. Myofibres within all cardiac muscle layers had positive immunohistochemical staining, as did blood vessel walls in the heart and spleen. These results suggest that juvenile mallards are highly susceptible to fatal WNV-associated cardiac failure, and confirm that adult Canada geese are susceptible to fatal WNV-associated disease. The synchronous timing of clinical disease and death in these waterfowl are consistent with WNV mosquito-borne infections within a WNV transmission focus during the summer (July and August) of 2012 and 2013.

An emerging novel spirochete in swine, provisionally designated "Brachyspira hampsonii," has been detected worldwide. It has been associated with swine dysentery and cannot be differentiated from B. hyodysenteriae, the classical etiologic agent of this disease, using standard phenotypic methods. We evaluated cross-reactions of "B. hampsonii" isolates recovered from avian species in some of the currently available species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for the identification of swine Brachyspira species. Ten avian "B. hampsonii" isolates recovered from wild waterfowl were used. No false-positive results were recorded with a B. pilosicoli-specific PCR based on the amplification of a fragment of the 16S rRNA gene. However, the percentage of false-positive results varied, with a range of 10-80%, in the evaluated B. hyodysenteriae-specific assays based on the amplification of the 23S rRNA, nox, and tlyA genes. Similarly, results of the B. intermedia-specific PCR assays yielded poor specificity, with up to 80% of the "B. hampsonii" isolates tested giving false-positive results. Finally, 2 "B. hampsonii" avian isolates yielded a positive result in a B. innocens- and B. murdochii-specific PCR. This result should be interpreted very cautiously as these 2 isolates could represent a recombinant genotype.

An account is given of a severe outbreak of type C botulism in waterfowl that occurred on the Norfolk Broads during the exceptionally warm summer of 1975. Forty-five mud samples were collected from 22 well distributed aquatic sites representing a considerable proportion of the total number of Broads. All samples except one (ie, 97-8 per cent) were shown to contain Clostridium botulinum and 58 per cent contained more than one type of the organism. Types B, C and E were demonstrated in 62-2 per cent, 51-1 per cent and 60 per cent of samples respectively. Recent surveys, made by identical methods, of aquatic environments in the London area and the Camargue (France) showed prevalences of Cl botulinum of 72-5 per cent and 4-5 per cent respectively. It seems likely that the Norfolk Broads will continue to present a risk to waterfowl from botulism in future hot summers.

The primary and secondary immune responses to thymus-dependent and -independent antigens were evaluated in normal male and female mice and in castrated male mice. Both IgM antibody production in the primary response and IgG antibody production in the secondary response were enhanced in females vs. males of equivalent age. Castration of the male converted this animal to a female in terms of responsiveness to the thymus-dependent group of antigens, while inducing equivalent or even greater enhanced responsiveness over the female to the thymus-independent antigen, polyvinylpyrrolidone. Further characteristics of the changes in lymphoid organs were determined in the castrated animal vs. normal males and females. It was shown that the spleen and thymus became markedly hyperplastic, the organ weights exceeding the female, which in turn were greater than in the male. The enhanced weight of the thymus was shown to be due to increased numbers of cortisone-sensitive cells, the absolute number of cortisone-resistant cells remaining equivalent to normal males and females. Thus, the increased thymic weight of the female also resided in the cortisone-sensitive population. Peripheral lymphocyte counts in castrated animals exceeded both normal males and females. Further experiments in gonadectomized males provided evidence that increased thymic cell activity per se played a role in enhanced response to thymus-dependent antigens, but that a thymic-derived hormone mediated the enhanced effect to the thymus-independent antigen in the castrated animal. The capacity for loss of androgenic hormone-producing tissue to generate enhanced differentiation of stem cells was denoted by experiments in which numbers of spleen colonies and uptake of (59)Fe, employed as an index of hematopoiesis 1 wk after reconstitution of lethally irradiated castrated and normal recipients, were enhanced in gonadectomized male animals. Thus, in summary, changes in sex hormone levels exerted a marked influence on immune responsiveness and stem cell differentiation, by increasing numbers of functioning cells, by promoting cellular differentiation, as well as by promoting cellular function via hormonal effects.

In a goose flock consisting of 2300 birds of 6 months of age severe goitre was diagnosed. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of naturally occurring goitre in geese, which is not related to the feeding of rapeseed meal. The major pathological findings included retarded growth and plumage development, significantly (300%) increased relative thyroid weight, fat accumulation in the mesenteric and abdominal region, and lipid infiltration of liver and kidney cells. Subsequent hormone analysis showed undetectable thyroxine (T4) levels and a dramatic drop in triiodothyronine (T3) plasma levels of the diseased geese. Thyroidal histology displayed the typical signs of struma parenchymatosa. In order to get more information about the possible causes of the goitre, 10 geese from the affected farm were transferred into the laboratories of the Central Veterinary Institute. The geese were allotted into two groups. Group I received iodine supplementation for 55 days, while the other group served as sick control (Group S). Iodine treatment caused a dramatic improvement in the birds' clinical condition except in plumage growth in Group I, while the clinical and main pathological signs of goitre remained unchanged or worsened in the untreated Group S. Contrary to this, the serum levels of thyroid hormones and responsiveness to thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) improved not only in Group I but also in Group S. Almost euthyroid biochemical parameters were found after 55 days of iodine treatment in Group I and, surprisingly, a considerable improvement (especially in serum T3 levels) occurred also in Group S. These findings confirm the diagnosis of goitre but also call attention to the fact that iodine deficiency was not the only factor eliciting the disorder. The underlying possible goitrogenic substance could not be traced down.

The pineal organs of 14-week-old domestic geese were investigated with light and electron microscopy. The pineals consisted of a wide distal part and a narrow middle-proximal one. The glands were attached to the intercommissural region via the choroid plexus. The pineal parenchyma was formed by round or elongated follicles. The follicular wall was composed predominantly by cells immunoreactive with antibodies against hydroxyindolo-O-methyltransferase (HIOMT) or glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP). They formed two or more layers. HIOMT-positive elements were represented by elongated cells bordering the follicular lumen and oval cells located in the external layer of the follicular wall. These cells were identified in ultrastructural studies as rudimentary-receptor pinealocytes and secretory pinealocytes, respectively. Among rudimentary-receptor pinealocytes two types of cells, designed as A and B, were distinguished due to structural differences. Type A cells extended through the whole follicular wall and showed regular stratified distribution of organelles in well-recognizable zones with rough endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus and mitochondria. Type B cells, like type A pinealocytes, contacted the pineal lumen and showed polarity of their internal structure. However, they were markedly shorter than the cells of type A and lacked stratified distribution of organelles. Secretory pinealocytes contained irregularly dispersed organelles. A prominent feature of all types of goose pinealocytes was the presence of numerous dense core vesicles. The population of GFAP-positive cells consisted of ependymal-like supporting cells and astrocyte-like cells.

The natural habitats and potential reservoirs of the nosocomial pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii are poorly defined. Here, we put forth and tested the hypothesis of avian reservoirs of A. baumannii. We screened tracheal and rectal swab samples from livestock (chicken, geese) and wild birds (white stork nestlings) and isolated A. baumannii from 3% of sampled chicken (n = 220), 8% of geese (n = 40) and 25% of white stork nestlings (n = 661). Virulence of selected avian A. baumannii isolates was comparable to that of clinical isolates in the Galleria mellonella infection model. Whole genome sequencing revealed the close relationship of an antibiotic-susceptible chicken isolate from Germany with a multidrug-resistant human clinical isolate from China and additional linkages between livestock isolates and human clinical isolates related to international clonal lineages. Moreover, we identified stork isolates related to human clinical isolates from the United States. Multilocus sequence typing disclosed further kinship between avian and human isolates. Avian isolates do not form a distinct clade within the phylogeny of A. baumannii, instead they diverge into different lineages. Further, we provide evidence that A. baumannii is constantly present in the habitats occupied by storks. Collectively, our study suggests A. baumannii could be a zoonotic organism that may disseminate into livestock.

On January 4, 2007, an emaciated mountain hawk-eagle was found in Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus subtype H5N1 was isolated from both tracheal and cloacal swabs of the dead bird. On January 13, an outbreak of HPAI, caused by H5N1 strain, occurred in a chicken farm in Miyazaki Prefecture. Within three weeks, three additional outbreaks had occurred (two in Miyazaki Prefecture and one in Okayama Prefecture). To investigate the relationship between the hawk-eagle isolate and chicken isolates, we studied the virus growth, pathogenicity, and phylogenetic information of this hawk-eagle isolate. The highest virus titer was found in the brain (10(7.25 )EID(50)/g), followed by trachea and muscle (10(2.65) and 10(2.50) EID(50)/g, respectively). Sequence analysis at the hemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site of this isolate revealed a typical virulent-type sequence, R-R-R-K-K-R. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the hawk-eagle isolate belongs to Qinghai Lake type virus group. A homology search of the HA gene also showed major similarity (more than 99%) to the Miyazaki and Okayama isolates in 2007 and also Korean isolates in 2006. These results suggest that Qinghai Lake type H5N1 HPAI virus was newly introduced from Asian Continent into Japan, and had already present in natural environment of Kyusyu district in the beginning of January 2007.

The aim of the study was to determine the in vitro susceptibility of 85 Aspergillus fumigatus strains isolated from domestic geese and from their environment to amphotericin B, clotrimazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, enilconazole, miconazole, ketoconazole, and tioconazole. Samples were collected from clinically healthy birds (oral cavity) and from birds with aspergillosis (lungs and air sacs). The study was carried out using the disk diffusion method according to the Clinical Laboratory and Standards Institute (CLSI) M44-A2 procedure in parallel with the microdilution broth method according to CLSI M38-A2. The disk diffusion method showed that the all of the strains, irrespective of source, were resistant to miconazole. Resistance to the remaining azoles and amphotericin B ranged from 90.6 to 70.6%. Complete susceptibility was noted for voriconazole and enilconazole. Determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) confirmed the high resistance of the strains tested to clotrimazole (MIC90 = 16 µg•mL(-1)), amphotericin B (MIC90 = 16 µg•mL(-1)), varied susceptibility to itraconazole (MIC 0.5-8 µg•mL(-1)), and 100% susceptibility to enilconazole and voriconazole. A correlation was noted between the susceptibility of the strains and their source. The highest percentage of resistant strains was noted in isolates from the lungs (100% for amphotericin B and clotrimazole and 35.7% for itraconazole). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first monitoring conducted in Poland in this area of research.

A spectrophotometric procedure for standardizing red blood cell suspensions for use in viral hemagglutination tests is described. The procedure is based on highly reproducible cyanmethemoglobin absorbance readings at 540 nm on any suitable spectrophotometer. Target values for milligrams of cyanmethemoglobin per 100 ml are given for the red cell suspensions of all mammalian and avian species employed in viral hemagglutination tests. By use of these values and a cyanmethemoglobin standard curve for a particular photometer, approximate 4% erythrocyte suspensions can be diluted to any lesser concentration. Coefficients of variation for the various diluted suspensions range from 4 to 7%.

Thirteen mammalian aquaporin (AQP) isoforms have been identified, and they have a unique tissue-specific pattern of expression. AQPs have been found in the reproductive system of both male and female humans, rats, and mice. However, tissue expression and cellular and subcellular localization of AQPs have been poorly investigated in the male reproductive system of birds. The localization of AQP subtypes (AQP1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 11) in the goose testis and vas deferens has been studied through immunohistochemistry and immunobloting. Interestingly, the testicular and deferential tissues were positive for AQP1, -5, and -7 but not the others. AQP1 immunoreactivity was detected in the capillary endothelial cells of testis and vas deferens. AQP5 was localized in the interstitial tissue of the testis, including Leydig cells, as well as in the basal cells of vas deferens. Double-labeling confocal microscopy revealed coexpression of AQP5 with capillary AQP1 in the testis. AQP7 was expressed in elongated spermatid and spermatozoa tails in the testis, as well as spermatozoa tails in the vas deferens. These results suggest that several subtypes of AQPs are involved in the regulation of water homeostasis in the goose male reproductive system.

Three naturally ethylene glycol (EG)-intoxicated geese were investigated for pathological changes, nitrosative tissue damage and apoptotic cell death. Severe degeneration of kidney tubular epithelium and congestion of kidney and liver tissues were observed. Immunohistochemical staining for inducible nitric oxide synthase and nitrotyrosine revealed strong immunoreactivity with both antibodies in kidney and liver tissues compared with the weak immunostaining in the control animals. In both tissues of the EG-intoxicated geese, erythrocytes were also highly immunoreactive with nitrotyrosine antibody. A high degree of apoptotic cell death was present in the kidney tubule epithelium of EG-intoxicated geese. Some apoptotic cells were also observed in the liver. These results show that nitrosative tissue damage and apoptotic cell death takes place in kidney and liver during EG intoxication in geese.

Cell-free extracts from the uropygial gland of goose catalyzed the incorporation of malonyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA into n- and multi-branched fatty acids, respectively, with NADPH as the preferred reductant. Methylmalonyl-CoA was shown to be incorporated almost exclusively into the acyl portion of wax esters by the cell-free extract while malonyl-CoA was incorporated into polar lipids and both the acyl and alcohol portions of the wax. The optimal pH for the synthesis of both n- and multibranched acids was 6.0. Apparent Km and Vmax for malonyl-CoA were 2 times 10- minus-4 M and 250 nmol per min per mg, respectively, while the Km and Vmax for methylmalonyl-CoA were 7.7 times 10- minus-4 M and 0.8 nmol per min per mg, respectively with 105,000g supernatant; but partial purification resulted in a tenfold decrease in Km values. The partially purified synthetase preparation catalyzed the formation of n-C16 acid (80%) and n-C18 acid (20%) from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA. With the same synthetase preparation and the appropriate primer methylmalonyl-CoA was converted into 2,4,6,8-tetramethyldecanoic acid and 2,4,6,8-tetramethylundecanoic acid which were identified by radio gas-liquid chromatography and combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Experiments with an equimolecular mixture of acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA showed that the synthetase preferred acetyl-CoA as a primer. Since malonyl-CoA is known to be rapidly decarboxylated in the gland, acetyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA are expected to be the major primer and elongating agent, respectively, available in the gland and therefore 2,4,6,8-tetramethyldecanoic acid should be the major product. Combined gas-liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry demonstrated that this acid was in fact the major acid of the gland.

Avian species necropsied at the C. S. Roberts Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, Auburn, Alabama, from December 1993 until May 1994 were examined for the incidence of intestinal campylobacters. Ninety-one intestinal swabs, representing 66 separate cases and 17 different avian species, were collected and placed into Cary-Blair transport medium. Selective enrichment and culture media were used for initial isolation of Campylobacter spp. Presumptive colonies were identified as Campylobacter spp. by phase-contrast microscopy and Gram stain, and they were confirmed by serological latex agglutination. Campylobacter spp. were isolated in 18 (19.7%) of the 66 cases. From the remainder of the cases, 13 (15%) yielded presumptive colonies on Campy-Cefex agar; however, they were not confirmed serologically as Campylobacter spp. Use of Cary-Blair transport medium held in refrigeration for up to 24 days did not hinder the determination of campylobacters in intestinal samples. A variety of avian species, including chicken, emu, hawk, ostrich, and parrot, harbored commensal campylobacters and therefore should be considered potential reservoirs.

Avian vacuolar myelinopathy (AVM) is a neurologic disease of unknown etiology that affects bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), American coots (Fulica americana), and several species of waterfowl. An unidentified neurotoxin is suspected as the cause of AVM, which has been documented at several reservoirs in the southeastern United States. We conducted diagnostic and epidemiologic studies annually during October-March from 1998-2004 at Clarks Hill/Strom Thurmond Lake on the Georgia/South Carolina border to better understand the disease. Avian vacuolar myelinopathy was confirmed or suspected as the cause of morbidity and mortality of 28 bald eagles, 16 Canada geese (Branta canadensis), six American coots, two great-horned owls (Bubo virginianus), and one killdeer (Charadrius vociferus). Active surveillance during the outbreaks yielded annual average prevalence of vacuolar lesions in 17-94% of coots, but not in 10 beavers (Castor canadensis), four raccoons (Procyon lotor), and one gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) collected for the study. Brain lesions were not apparent in 30 Canada geese collected and examined in June 2002. The outbreaks at this location from 1998-2004 represent the most significant AVM-related bald eagle mortality since the Arkansas epornitics of 1994-95 and 1996-97, as well as the first confirmation of the disease in members of Strigiformes and Charadriiformes.

Egypt has experienced outbreaks of avian influenza (AI) since 2006. A total of 3583 cloacal swabs were collected from chickens, ducks, geese and turkeys from commercial farms, backyards and local bird markets in Qena and Luxor governorates in South Egypt during 2009-2011. These samples were examined for the presence of AI virus (AIV) and positive samples were further subtyped for the H5 and H9 by real time RT-PCR. In this way, 202 (5.64%) samples were found to be AIV-positive of which 186 (92.08%) and 7 (3.46%) belonged to H5 and H9 subtypes, respectively. Higher infection rates were observed in backyard birds and birds from local bird markets in comparison to birds from commercial farms. In conclusion, the predominance of H5 infection indicates a need for continuous monitoring of AIV among avian species and the awareness against public health risk.

Phenotypic and genotypic diversity of forty-two Pasteurella multocida isolates from geese were characterized by analysis of their capsular type, Heddleston serotype, biotype, fimbrial gene allele type, comparative outer membrane protein (OMP) electrophoresis patterns, and were analyzed using PCR for the presence of virulence-associated genes (toxA, tbpA, pfhA, hgbA, hgbB, nanH, nanB, fimA, hsf-1, and pmHAS). A sequence comparison of the thdF and rpoB housekeeping genes of twenty representative P. multocida strains from three different OMP groups demonstrated that seventeen strains were closely related phylogenetically to previously published strains of P. multocida subsp. multocida and P. multocida subsp. gallicida, and only three strains from geese were grouped with previously published strains of P. multocida subsp. septica. This study is the first report regarding the characterization of phenotypic and genotypic features of different P. multocida field strains isolated from geese with the different clinical representation of pasteurellosis and provide our overview on the usefulness of these in vitro tests for primary characterization of P. multocida strains for the epidemiological studies of fowl cholera.

The presence of Escherichia coli in recreational and potable waters is a major concern to the general public as elevated levels of E. coli suggest the presence of pathogenic bacteria and viruses. Unfortunately, traditional microbial techniques do not allow specific identification of the source of E. coli. This reduces the ability to target management practices that reduce bacterial contamination. In the Finger Lakes region of western New York, USA, wildlife resides in relatively high densities on watersheds dominated by people and dairy farms, and as a result, the sources of fecal degradation of potable and recreational waters are often unknown. In the Conesus Lake watershed, the sources of microbial contamination were assessed using Rep-PCR molecular tools, a method of amplifying repetitive DNA sequences found throughout the E. coli genome to produce distinct fingerprints for a given ecotype. Molecular fingerprints of E. coli isolated from regional populations of cattle, humans, geese and deer were compared to E. coli isolated from stream water samples. Canonical discriminant function analysis indicated that the DNA fingerprints of the original source group isolates were correctly predicted 90.2% of the time. Since land use in the sub-watersheds was dominated by dairy and cash crop farms, it was expected that the majority of E. coli isolated would be identified as cows; however, an unexpectedly high percentage of isolates were identified as wildlife (geese and deer). Geese were the dominant source of E. coli (44.7-73.7% of the total sources) in four sub-watersheds followed by cows (10.5-21.1%), deer (10.5-18.4%), humans (5.3-12.9%) and unidentifiable sources (0.0-11.8%). Management practices intended to decrease the number of cattle or the amount of manure spread in a sub-watershed were reflected in a decrease of E. coli ecotypes associated with dairy cows.

Avian erythrocytes possess a Na+ and K+ cotransport system which can be inhibited by loop diuretics. The newly discovered diuretic effect of secretin in man led us to study the effect of this hormone on the cotransport system. Secretin caused a 50% inhibition of the 8BrcAMP-stimulated 86Rb influx into red blood cells from goose at a concentration of 8.5 X 10(-6) M, while furosemide and bumetanide caused a 50% inhibition at concentrations of 7 X 10(-6) M and 9 X 10(-8) M, respectively. It is suggested that the diuretic effect of secretin is mediated through an inhibitory or blocking effect on the Na+ and K+ cotransport system.

The hypothesis that tissue-specific levels of thyroid hormones may be required for normal locomotor muscle development was investigated in the barnacle goose Branta leucopsis. Hypothyroidism was induced in goslings by treatment with methimazole from either 3 days or 2 weeks of age, and birds were killed at 7 weeks of age. The masses of the pectoralis, iliofibularis, semimembranosus and cardiac ventricle muscles were measured, and samples from these tissues were analysed for the mass-specific activity of the mitochondrial enzyme citrate synthase (CS). An ultrastructural electron micrograph analysis of the pectoralis was also carried out. No significant differences were found between the two hypothyroid groups except for the effect on the relative mass of the iliofibularis muscle. Developmental responses to hypothyroidism were found to be tissue-specific. Hypothyroidism resulted in a significantly lower relative cardiac ventricle mass (by 17 %) and CS activity of the leg muscles (by 34 %), while absolute leg muscle mass was not affected. The relative mass of the pectoralis was significantly lower (by 57 %) in hypothyroid birds and showed a significant, uniformly lower CS activity (by 60-83 %) as a result of a lower mitochondrial fractional volume. Haematocrit and capillary-to-fibre ratio in the pectoralis were also significantly lower in hypothyroid birds, and skeletal growth and plumage development were affected.

Translation of goose parvovirus (GPV) 72 kDa Rep 1 is initiated from unspliced P9-generated mRNAs in ORF1 from the first in-frame AUG (537 AUG); however, this AUG is bypassed in spliced P9-generated RNA: translation of the 52 kDa Rep 2 protein from spliced RNA is initiated in ORF2 at the next AUG downstream (650 AUG). Usage of the 537 AUG was restored in spliced RNA when the GPV intron was replaced with a chimeric SV40 intron, or following specific mutations of the GPV intron which did not appear in the final spliced mRNA. Additionally, 650 AUG usage was gained in unspliced RNA when the GPV intron splice sites were debilitated. Splicing-dependent regulation of translation initiation was mediated in cis by GPV RNA surrounding the target AUGs. Thus, nuclear RNA processing of GPV P9-generated pre-mRNAs has a complex, but significant, effect on alternative translation initiation of the GPV Rep proteins.

In this study, two H5N1 influenza viruses (HN021 and HN211) were isolated in wild ducks and the characteristics of these viruses were studied systemically. By studying the pathogenesis of both H5N1 isolates, the results showed that HN211 was highly pathogenic in chickens, geese, ducks, and mice, while HN021 was highly pathogenic in chickens and geese but low pathogenic in ducks and mice. Both isolates could replicate in lungs and brains of mice and be transmitted from ducks to ducks. Histopathologic analysis showed that HN211 could cause more severe pathological changes in lungs and brains of infected mice than HN021. Molecular characterization showed that both H5N1 isolates had 20 aa missing in stalk of NA protein and 5 aa missing in NS protein in comparison with most other H5N1 isolates. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that both H5N1 isolates were reassortants from Goose/Guangdong/1/96-like viruses. The results of present study with both H5N1 viruses also suggested that wild ducks may play an important role in maintaining circulation of H5N1 viruses.

We collected samples from apparently healthy geese in the Playa Lakes Region (USA) during the winters of 2000-01 and 2001-02 to determine whether carriers of Pasteurella multocida, the bacterium that causes avian cholera, were present in wild populations. With the use of methods developed in laboratory challenge trials (Samuel et al., 2003a) and a serotype-specific polymerase chain reaction method for identification of P. multocida serotype 1, we found that a small proportion of 322 wild birds (<5%) were carriers of pathogenic P. multocida. On the basis of serology, an additional group of these birds (<10%) were survivors of recent avian cholera infection. Our results confirm the hypothesis that wild waterfowl are carriers of avian cholera and add support for the hypothesis that wild birds are a reservoir for this disease. In concert with other research, this work indicates that enzootic infection with avian cholera occurs in lesser snow goose (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) populations throughout their annual cycle. Although fewer Ross's geese (Chen rossii) were sampled, we also found these birds were carriers of P. multocida. Even in the absence of disease outbreaks, serologic evidence indicates that chronic disease transmission and recent infection are apparently occurring year-round in these highly gregarious birds and that a small portion of these populations are potential carriers with active infection.

The environmental assessment of long-term nuclear waste management requires data to estimate food chain transfers for radionuclides in various environmental settings. For key elements such as iodine (I) and chlorine (Cl), there is a paucity of transfer factor data, particularly outside of agricultural food chains. This study dealt with transfers of I, Cl and 28 other elements to foods that would be typical of boreal hunter/gatherer lifestyles, as well as being common foods for modern recreational and subsistence hunters. Food/substrate concentration ratios (CRs) and related transfer factors for eight species of widely distributed fish, whitetail deer (Odocoileus virginianus), Canada geese (Branta canadensis) and wild blueberries (Vaccinium myrtilloides) were measured and compared to the literature. Limited data were obtained for caribou (Rangifer tarandus), elk (Cervus elaphus) and moose (Alces americanus). Freshwater sediment Kd values and CRs for a ubiquitous freshwater macrophyte were also obtained. The CRs for I in fish were 29Lkg(-1) in edible muscle (fillets) of large-bodied species and 85Lkg(-1) for whole, small-bodied fish. The logCRs for fish and macrophytes were correlated across elements. For several elements, the Kds for sediments in deep water were approximately 4-fold higher than for littoral samples. The elemental transfers to wild animals for some elements were notably different than the literature indicates for domestic animals. It is argued that the transfer data obtained using indigenous elements from real environmental settings, as opposed to contaminant elements in experimental or impacted environments, are especially relevant to assessment of long-term impacts.

Male-specific (F+) coliphages have been investigated as viral indicators of fecal contamination that may provide source-specific information for impacted environmental waters. This study examined the presence and proportions of the different subgroups of F+ coliphages in a variety of fecal wastes and surface waters with well-defined potential waste impacts. Municipal wastewater samples had high proportions of F+ DNA and group II and III F+ RNA coliphages. Bovine wastewaters also contained a high proportion of F+ DNA coliphages, but group I and IV F+ RNA coliphages predominated. Swine wastewaters contained approximately equal proportions of F+ DNA and RNA coliphages, and group I and III F+ RNA coliphages were most common. Waterfowl (gull and goose) feces contained almost exclusively F+ RNA coliphages of groups I and IV. No F+ coliphages were isolated from the feces of the other species examined. F+ coliphage recovery from surface waters was influenced by precipitation events and animal or human land use. There were no significant differences in coliphage density among land use categories. Significant seasonal variation was observed in the proportions of F+ DNA and RNA coliphages. Group I F+ RNA coliphages were the vast majority (90%) of those recovered from surface waters. The percentage of group I F+ RNA coliphages detected was greatest at background sites, and the percentage of group II F+ RNA coliphages was highest at human-impacted sites. Monitoring of F+ coliphage groups can indicate the presence and major sources of microbial inputs to surface waters, but environmental effects on the relative occurrence of different groups need to be considered.

In the framework of a study aimed to ascertain the possibilities of infection transmission from mother to child the athors examined serologically gravid women for toxoplasmosis and antibodies against listeriosis, using routine methods, in Austria in 1974, 1975 and 1975. Almost all gynecologists of the region of Styria (Austrial), who systematically delivered data concerning abortions, premature births and stillbirths, were invited to take part in the study. At the same time data concerning domestic and wild animals examined for antibodies against listeriosis in Austria in 1974, 1975, 1976 and 1977, were compared.

Methods developed for porphyrin analysis have low recoveries and/or poor precision for the less polar protoporphyrin IX. We describe a simple method of analysis of porphyrins and biliverdin in bile and excreta of birds based on extraction with HCl 3N: acetonitrile and HPLC/UV analyses. Recoveries were good for protoporphyrin IX and other porphyrins (>79%). Applications of this method showed that porphyrins and biliverdin in birds excreta are mainly of biliary-fecal origin rather than urinary origin. Biliverdin and protoporphyrin IX increased proportionately more than the rest of the porphyrins and coproporphyrin III increased more than coproporphyrin I in the bile of Pb-poisoned mallards.

Previous studies have demonstrated that focal electrical stimulation of regions within the brainstem of a decerebrate bird will elicit all the normal patterns of avian locomotion. However, electrical stimulation can activate a variety of neuronal elements within the radius of effective current spread, including axons of passage traversing the stimulation point. To restrict activation to neuronal cell bodies within the immediate vicinity, we have utilized direct intracerebral injection of neurotransmitters, their agonists and antagonists, into identified brainstem locomotor regions. To undertake these studies, birds (geese or ducks) were placed in a stereotaxic frame and decerebrated under halothane anesthesia. After completion of surgery, several discrete locomotor regions were first identified with electrical microstimulation. Acetylcholine (ACh) and excitatory amino acid (EAA) agonists and antagonists, as well as Substance P were then slowly infused into each brainstem region. Any change in locomotor behavior was recorded by electromyographic techniques. When injected into a variety of sites, carbachol (an ACh nicotinic (AChN) and muscarinic (AChM) agonist) and pilocarpine (an AChM agonist) evoked locomotion, whereas atropine (an AChM antagonist) blocked locomotion. N-methyl-D-aspartate NMDA), but not glutamate, also elicited locomotion or reduced the current intensity threshold for electrically-evoked locomotion. The NMDA-induced locomotion evoked locomotion. The NMDA-induced locomotion could be blocked by the injection of glutamic acid diethyl ester (GDEE, an EAA antagonist) or D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5) into the same site. Finally. Substance P also evoked locomotion. The above observations strongly suggest that brainstem electrically-stimulated locomotion in decerebrate birds is not due to activation of fibers traversing a brainstem locomotor region, but instead, is due to the activation of receptors located on neuronal cell bodies, dendrites or presynaptic terminals in the immediate vicinity of the micropipette tip. After correlating our findings with similar lamprey and mammalian studies, the comparable discoveries serve to underscore the suggestion that the neuroanatomical substrates underlying the brainstem control of locomotion appear to be highly conserved in all vertebrates.

The first known cases of human infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses in Vietnam occurred in late 2003. However, HPAI H5N1 and low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H5N2 and H9N3 viruses were isolated from domestic waterfowl during live-bird market (LBM) surveillance in Vietnam in 2001 and 2003. To understand the possible role of these early viruses in the genesis of H5N1 strains infecting people, we performed sequencing and molecular characterization. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the hemagglutinin (HA) genes of two geese HPAI H5N1 strains belonged to clade 3, and their surface glycoprotein and replication complex genes were most closely related (98.5-99.7% homologous) to A/duck/Guangxi/22/01 (H5N1) virus, detected contemporarily in southern China, whilst the M and NS genes were derived from an A/duck/Hong Kong/2986.1/00 (H5N1)-like virus. The H5 HA gene of the duck HPAI H5N1 strain belonged to clade 5 and acquired a gene constellation from A/quail/Shantou/3846/02 (H5N1), A/teal/China/2978.1/02 (H5N1) and A/partridge/Shantou/2286/03 (H5N1)-like viruses. The phylogenetic analysis further indicated that all eight gene segments of goose and duck HPAI H5N1 and LPAI H5N2 viruses were distinct from those of H5N1 clade-1 viruses known to have caused fatal human infections in Vietnam since late 2003. The duck H9N3 isolates derived genes from aquatic-bird influenza viruses, and their H9 HA belonged to the Korean lineage. The PB2 gene of A/duck/Vietnam/340/01 (H9N3) virus had lysine at position 627. Based on the molecular characterization of specific amino acid residues in the surface and relevant internal protein-coding genes, the Vietnamese H5N1 and H9N3 virus isolates indicated specificity to avian cell surface receptor and susceptibility for currently licensed anti-influenza A virus chemotherapeutics. Our findings suggest that the H5N1 and H5N2 viruses that circulated among geese and ducks in LBMs in Hanoi, Vietnam, during 2001 and 2003 were not the immediate ancestors of the clade-1 viruses associated with fatal human infections in Vietnam. The clade-1 HPAI H5N1 viruses were independently introduced into Vietnam.

The criteria for the selection of stocks and strains of laboratory animals were discussed. These include metabolic and environmental factors as well as the presence or introduction of infectious agents. The investigator is now concerned with his experimental animals from conception to death, not just during an experiment. The basis of a health monitoring program to ascertain the health status of incoming animals, to evaluate the status of the environment, and to document the ongoing status of an animal colony was outlined. The facilities of the Yale School of Medicine animal research space were detailed.

A paramyxovirus designated as APMV-1 (NDV) isolate SF02 (abbre. as SF02) was recently isolated from goose in China. SF02 was identified as a member of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) genotype VII. NDV strains are generally pathogenic only for fowls, including chicken and pigeon, and not for waterfowls such as goose and duck, whereas SF02 is highly pathogenic for both fowls and waterfowls. In the present study the complete genome consisting of 15, 192 nucleotides of SF02 was sequenced. Genomes of SF02 and all known APMV-1, Strains contain 6 ORFs in the order of NP-P-M-F-HN-L, and that of SF02 had an extra 6 nts between NP and P genes. Moreover, an anti-sense ORF consisting of 549 nt at the 1960 to 1412 and deduced 182 amino acids was found in SF02. The SF02 genome shared 83% identity and its 6 ORFs 81.9-86.1% identities with the reference APMV-1 strains. The possible mechanism determining different host range and pathogenicity is discussed based on genetic analyses.

Goose can develop severe hepatic steatosis without overt injury, thus it may serve as a unique model for uncovering how steatosis-related injury is prevented. To identify the markedly prosteatotic and protective mechanisms, we performed an integrated analysis of liver transcriptomes and gut microbial metagenomes using samples collected from overfed and normally-fed geese at different time points. The results indicated that the fatty liver transcriptome, initially featuring a 'metabolism' pathway, was later joined by 'cell growth and death' and 'immune diseases' pathways. Gut microbiota played a synergistic role in the liver response as microbial and hepatic genes affected by overfeeding shared multiple pathways. Remarkably, the complement system, an inflammatory component, was comprehensively suppressed in fatty liver, which was partially due to increased blood lactic acid from enriched Lactobacillus. Data from in vitro studies suggested that lactic acid suppressed TNFα via the HNF1α/C5 pathway. In conclusion, gut microbes and their hosts respond to excess energy influx as an organic whole, severe steatosis and related tolerance of goose liver may be partially attributable to gut microbiotic products and suppressed complement system, and lactic acid from gut microbiota participates in the suppression of hepatic TNFα/inflammation through the HNF1α/C5 pathway.

Many reports have demonstrated that birds show a low degree of fatty acid unsaturation and lipid peroxidation compared with mammals of similar body size. The aim of the present study was to examine fatty acid profiles, non-enzymatic lipid peroxidation and vitamin E levels of mitochondria and microsomes obtained from liver, heart and brain of goose (Anser anser). The unsaturated fatty acid content found in mitochondria and microsomes of all tissues examined was approximately 60% with a prevalence of C18:1 n9 + C18:2 n6 = 50%. The 20:4 n6 + C22:6 n3 content was significantly higher in brain organelles (approx. 16%) compared with mitochondria and microsomes of liver and heart (approx. 4%). Whereas these organelles were not affected when subjected to lipid peroxidation, brain mitochondria were highly affected, as indicated by the increase in chemiluminescence and a considerable decrease of arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acids. These changes were not observed during lipid peroxidation of brain microsomes. Vitamin E content was higher in liver and heart than in brain mitochondria (1.77 +/- 0.06 and 1.93 +/- 0.13 vs. 0.91 +/- 0.09 nmol/mg protein). The main conclusion of this paper is that a lower degree of unsaturation of fatty acids in liver and heart mitochondria and a higher vitamin E level than in brain mitochondria protect those tissues against lipid peroxidation.

We report here a case of hepatic myelolipoma with systemic amyloidosis in a goose (Anser cygnoides domesticus), which died suddenly following the short history of weakness and greenish diarrhea. At necropsy, multiple yellowish-white foci were observed on the surface of the prominently enlarged liver. Histologically, there were multiple foci of adipose tissue admixed with myeloid elements in various proportions in the liver as well as amyloid deposition in several organs including the liver, intestine, spleen, kidney, and ovary. Ultrastructurally, erythroblast-like cells and myelocytes, which showed various stages of differentiation, were observed in the foci of the liver. These findings shared characteristics of hepatic myelolipoma which is very rare in birds.

Nicarbazin (NCZ), a coccidiostat used in the poultry industry, has been developed as a contraceptive for resident Canada geese. We tested the efficacy of NCZ as a contraceptive using mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) as a model for Canada geese. Nicarbazin-treated corn was fed ad libitum for 14 d at 0, 750, 1,000, or 1,500 ppm. Plasma and egg levels of 4,4'-dinitrocarbanilide (DNC), the active anticoccidial component of NCZ, differed among treatment groups in a dose-response relationship, but plasma levels did not differ between sexes. Nicarbazin caused a decrease in egg weight, but there was no effect of NCZ on the numbers of eggs laid per female per day. Nicarbazin did not significantly impact bird health. An additional trial tested the effect of the method of NCZ delivery on plasma DNC levels. Mallards were given NCZ daily for 12 d either by gavage with a corn oil suspension, gavage with a water suspension, peroral administration of a capsule, or feeding 500 mg of NCZ/kg of pelleted feed ad libitum. The method of delivery significantly affected plasma DNC levels, with the highest levels in the corn oil suspension group and the lowest levels in the pelleted feed group. This is likely due to decreased availability of NCZ in a pellet compared with gavage with a suspension or capsule. Mallards receiving 34.2 mg of NCZ/kg of BW when fed cracked corn coated with NCZ daily for 14 d had higher plasma DNC levels than those obtained by liquid gavage, capsule, or pelleted NCZ feed. For maximum effect in the field, NCZ should be coated onto corn. A higher concentration of NCZ is needed in pelleted feed to obtain comparable plasma DNC levels to allow for the decreased absorption of DNC.

The goose parvovirus (GPV) Rep1 protein is both essential for viral replication and a potential target for GPV diagnosis, but its protein characterization and intracellular localization is not clear. We constructed a recombinant plasmid, pET28a/GPV-Rep1, and expressed the Rep1 gene in BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli. A protein approximately 75 kDa in size was obtained from lysates of E. coli cells expressing the recombinant plasmid. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that after induction with 0.6 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactosidase (IPTG) at 30°C for 5 h, the Rep1 protein was highly overexpressed. Two methods used to purify proteins, a salinity-gradient elution and Ni-NTA affinity chromatography, were performed. The amount of Rep1 protein obtained by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography was 41.23 mg, while 119.9 mg of Rep1 protein was obtained by a salinity-gradient elution from a 1 L E. coli BL21 (DE3) culture. An immunogenicity analysis showed that the protein could significantly elicit a specific antibody response in immunized goslings compared to control groups. Antibody titers peaked to 1:5120 (optical density (OD) 450 = 3.9) on day 28 after immunization but had mean titers of 1:10,240 (OD450 = 4.2) in gosling groups immunized with a commercially available GPV-attenuated vaccine strain. Experiments examining subcellular localization showed that the Rep1 protein appeared to associate predominantly with the nuclear membrane, especially during later times of infection. This work provides a basis for biochemical and structural studies on the GPV Rep1 protein.

A number of behavioral and physiological parameters including the circulating levels of 7 hormones were investigated in a free ranging population of barheaded geese in Seewiesen, W. Germany. Behavioral data were collected on the entire flock from which seasonal changes in the frequencies were determined. In addition, data on the behavior of individuals were obtained to aid in the comparison of seasonal changes in behavior and hormones. The resulting curves were used to examine whether the annual changes in the frequencies of various behaviors were related to changes in circulating hormonal concentrations. Lastly, the physiological data were discussed with regard to reproductive biology in birds.

Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is believed to infect only domestic avian species, with waterfowl such as geese either not being infected, even by virulent strains, or developing only inapparent infection. Since the late 1990s, a new infectious disease producing high morbidity and mortality among geese broke out in many provinces of China. This disease was caused by a serotype I avian paramyxovirus known as (APMV-1)-NDV. To investigate how NDV spreads between chickens and geese, the serological similarities of NDV strains (goose-origin NDV/NA-1 and chicken-origin NDV/F48E9, F48E8) were assessed by cross-neutralization assays both in vivo and in vitro. The results indicated that antigenic variation had occurred between NDV/NA-1 strains and NDV/F48E9, F48E8 strains. Notably, NDV/NA-1 effectively protected vaccinated birds from morbidity and mortality against NDV/NA-1 strain challenge and significantly reduced virus shedding from the vaccinated birds when compared with F48E9-vaccinated birds. This might provide clues to the evolution of the goose NDV.

The crystal structure of a high oxygen affinity species of hemoglobin, bar-headed goose hemoglobin in deoxy form, has been determined to a resolution of 2.8 A. The R and R(free) factor of the model are 0.197 and 0.243, respectively. The structure reported here is a special deoxy state of hemoglobin and indicates the differences in allosteric mechanisms between the goose and human hemoglobins. The quaternary structure of the goose deoxy hemoglobin shows obvious differences from that of human deoxy hemoglobin. The rotation angle of one alphabeta dimer relative to its partner in a tetramer molecule from the goose oxy to deoxy hemoglobin is only 4.6 degrees, and the translation is only 0.3 A, which are much smaller than those in human hemoglobin. In the alpha(1)beta(2) switch region of the goose deoxy hemoglobin, the imidazole ring of His beta(2)97 does not span the side-chain of Thr alpha(1)41 relative to the oxy hemoglobin as in human hemoglobin. And the tertiary structure changes of heme pocket and FG corner are also smaller than that in human hemoglobin. A unique mutation among avian and mammalian Hbs of alpha119 from proline to alanine at the alpha(1)beta(1 )interface in bar-headed goose hemoglobin brings a gap between Ala alpha119 and Leu beta55, the minimum distance between the two residues is 4.66 A. At the entrance to the central cavity around the molecular dyad, some residues of two beta chains form a positively charged groove where the inositol pentaphosphate binds to the hemoglobin. The His beta146 is at the inositol pentaphosphate binding site and the salt-bridge between His beta146 and Asp beta94 does not exist in the deoxy hemoglobin, which brings the weak chloride-independent Bohr effect to bar-headed goose hemoglobin.

Ion transport and electrical properties of rabbit and guinea pig gallbladders were investigated to gain further information about the active transport mechanism that mediates fluid absorption. The intracellular and transepithelial electrical potentials were measured simultaneously using the microelectrode technique. Exposure of the mucosal surface to Amphotericin B resulted in the prompt development of a serosa-positive electrical potential difference (PD) which could not be attributed to an alteration in ion diffusion potentials across either the cell membrane or across the tight junction. Because the Amphotericin B-induced PD was immediately dependent on warm temperatures and O2, and was independent of NA and K concentration gradients across the cell membrane, it is suggested that active ion transport is directly responsible for the PD. Since the PD was abolished in the absence of Na in the bathing solutions, a rheogenic Na pump is postulated; this pump also appears to be operative in tissues not exposed to Amphotericin B. The specific tissue properties altered by Amphotericin B to produce a serosa-positive PD remain incompletely defined. The results of the present study indicate that ion transport by rabbit gallbladder in vitro is a consequence of a rheogenic active Na transport mechanism at the basolateral membranes which, in conjunction with a coupled NaC1 influx process at the mucosal border, ultimately results in absorption of NaC1 and water.

An outbreak of poisoning in four greylag geese (Anser anser) and 35-45 teal (Anas crecca) is described. Laboratory findings led to the conclusion that a wheat bait containing the rodenticide fluoracetamide (1081) caused the poisoning. Circumstantial evidence incriminated fluoracetamide as the cause of death in white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons), mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), and chukars (Alectoris chukar).

During 1997 and 1998, the U.S. Food Safety and Inspection Service completed nationwide microbiological baseline studies on four separate categories of livestock and poultry. Data were collected by sponge-sampling techniques. These studies were designed to provide nationwide estimates of the prevalence of Salmonella and prevalence and concentrations of Escherichia coli in cattle (n = 1,881), swine (n = 2,127), turkeys (n = 1,396), and geese (n = 102) in establishments under federal inspection. Salmonella prevalence ranged from 1.2% in cattle to 6.9% in swine, 13.7% in geese, and 19.6% in turkeys. The prevalence of E. coli was 16.6% in cattle (geometric mean = 0.26 CFU/cm2), 44.1% in swine (mean = 0.78 CFU/cm2), 92.7% in turkey (mean = 2.46 CFU/cm2), and 96.5% in geese (mean = 1.97 CFU/cm2). These values are similar to or somewhat lower than previous baseline values obtained for steers and heifers, cows and bulls, market hogs, and young turkeys. This study is the first in which nationwide microbiological baseline data have been compiled for geese. These data will be useful to individuals working with hazard analysis critical control point plans and risk assessment and to the research and academic communities.

Enolases are glycolytic enzymes in the glycolytic pathway. In order to evaluate the effect of ENO1 on follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) mRNA and luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) mRNA of primary granular cell from goose F1 follicles, the recombinant plasmid adenovirus carrying ENO1 were constructed and infected the primary culture granular cells. The granular cells were randomly divided into three groups: recombinant adenovirus infected (pAd-CMV-ENO1), empty vector infected (pAd-CMV-Null) and no virus (mock control). The expression levels of FSHR mRNA and LHR mRNA of granular cells were examined by qRT-PCR. The results showed the group pAd-CMV-ENO1 had significantly higher FSHR mRNA expression levels than the other two groups (P < 0.05), but had significantly lower LHR mRNA expression levels than the other two groups (P < 0.05). The results suggested that ENO1 could improve the combination rate between FSH and FSHR to accelerate the proliferation and differentiation and steroidogenesis in poultry gonadal tissues.

Epizootic mortality in several geese species, including cackling geese (Branta hutchinsii) and Canada geese (Branta canadensis), has been recognized in the Willamette Valley of Oregon for over a decade. Birds are generally found dead on a body of water or are occasionally observed displaying neurologic clinical signs such as an inability to raise or control the head prior to death. Investigation of these epizootic mortality events has revealed the etiology to be accidental poisoning with the rodenticide zinc phosphide (Zn(3)P(2)). Gross and histologic changes are restricted to acute pulmonary congestion and edema, sometimes accompanied by distension of the upper alimentary tract by fresh grass. Geese are unusually susceptible to this pesticide; when combined with an epidemiologic confluence of depredation of specific agricultural crops by rodents and seasonal avian migration pathways, epizootic toxicosis may occur. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion, appropriate sample collection and handling, plus specific test calibration for this toxicant. Interagency cooperation, education of farmers regarding pesticide use, and enforcement of regulations has been successful in greatly decreasing these mortality events since 2009.

Interferon (IFN)-induced 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) proteins exhibit an extensive and efficient antiviral effect against flavivirus infection in mammals and birds. Only the 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase-like (OASL) gene has been identified thus far in birds, except for ostrich, which has both OAS1 and OASL genes. In this study, we first investigated the antiviral activity of goose OASL (goOASL) protein against a duck-origin Tembusu virus (DTMUV) in duck embryo fibroblast cells (DEFs). To investigate the relationship of conserved amino acids that are related to OAS enzyme activity and ubiquitin-like (UBL) domains with the antiviral activity of goOASL, a series of mutant goOASL plasmids was constructed, including goOASL-S64C/D76E/D78E/D144T, goOASL∆UBLs and goOASL∆UBLs-S64C/D76E/D78E/D144T. Interestingly, all these mutant proteins significantly inhibited the replication of DTMUV in DEFs in a dose-dependent manner. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that the goOASL, goOASL-S64C/D76E/D78E/D144T, goOASL∆UBLs and goOASL∆UBLs-S64C/D76E/D78E/D144T proteins were located not only in the cytoplasm where DTMUV replicates but also in the nucleus of DEFs. However, the goOASL and goOASL mutant proteins were mainly colocalized with DTMUV in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Our data indicated that goOASL could significantly inhibit DTMUV replication in vitro, while the active-site residues S64, D76, D78 and D144, which were associated with OAS enzyme activity, the UBL domains were not required for the antiviral activity of goOASL protein.

Two flocks of geese in the South of Germany independently diseased on Haemorrhagic Nephritis and Enteritis of Geese (HNEG) at the age of 4 weeks. The flocks were approximately 300 km apart but had received goslings from the same hatchery. In both flocks the animals died within 12 hours mainly without showing clinical signs. Some of the first cases showed haemorrhagic typhlitis, whereas in later cases visceral gout was the main finding. In all cases, pathohistological examination generally showed necrosis of the tubular epithelium of the kidney. After a course of 5 weeks no new occurrences were seen. Death rates of 43.8% for the first flock and 29.2% for the second flock, respectively, were recorded. In both cases, the diagnosis HNEG was confirmed by the detection of the recently described Goose Haemorrhagic Polyomavirus (GHPV) using polymerase chain reaction.

Dimetridazole at a concentration of 1.0 g/l in drinking water caused mortality in both ducklings and goslings. When given to goslings at a concentration of 0.5 g/l, the drug caused growth depression and nervous signs characterized by excess activity, abnormal head attitudes, and ataxia.

The triplex PCR of Clermont et al. [Clermont, O., Bonacorsi, S., Bingen, E., 2000. Rapid and simple determination of the Escherichia coli phylogenetic groups. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 66, 4555-4558.] was used to genotype E. coli isolates from the Mid-Atlantic region of the USA, obtained from freshwater, animal internal organs, and feces. Of 445 isolates subjected to genotyping, 118 isolates (26%) were genotype A, 111 (25%) genotype D, 140 (31%) genotype B1, and 76 (17%) genotype B2. All four genotypes were present in three sets of freshwater stream samples. When isolates from chicken cecal ingesta, cecal mucosa, and tracheal mucosa were screened, there was selective distribution of genotypes in these organs. Genotype D was rarely encountered in feces, milk, and intestinal tissues of dairy cows, while all four genotypes were represented in goose feces. Isolates from the feces of zoo animals reared in the US demonstrated a predominance of genotype B1. Thirty-six of the A isolates in our overall collection were subgenotype A(0), in which none of the three amplicons are observed; confirmation that these isolates were E. coli was done using an ancillary lacZ PCR assay. We conclude that the genotyping triplex PCR assay, used in combination with traditional culture methods, can be useful in categorizing E. coli from environmental and veterinary sources in the Mid-Atlantic region of the USA.

There were studied formation's processes of feathering in chickens and goslings and role of sulphur sulphate in synthesis of keratin's feathers. It is established, that sulphur sulphate sodium is used for synthesis of precursors of keratin's feathers. The including of 35S-sulphate natrii regulates the intensity of feather's growth. The content of sulphur in amino acids containing sulphur in feathers of chickens for period from 1 till 60 days of age is increasing from 6.34 to 94.47 per cent. Fattening in composition of feed the sulphate natrii stimulates by chickens and goslings the intensity of feather's growth and metabolism of sulphur in skin.

Since the first detection of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus from sick goose in Guangdong province in China in 1996, scientists in China started to develop vaccines for avian influenza pandemic preparedness. An H5N2 inactivated vaccine was produced from a low pathogenic virus, A/turkey/England/N-28/73, and was used for the buffer zone vaccination in the H5N1 outbreaks in 2004 in China. We also generated a low pathogenic H5N1 reassortant virus A/Harbin/Re-1/2003 (Re-1) that derives its HA and NA genes from GSGD/96 virus and six internal genes from the high-growth A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) virus by using plasmid-based reverse genetics. The inactivated vaccine derived from Re-1 strain could induce more than 10 months protective immune response in chickens after one dose inoculation, and most importantly, this vaccine is immunogenic for geese and ducks. An H5N1 fowlpox vectored live vaccine was also generated by inserting the HA and NA genes of GSGD/96 virus in the genome of a fowlpox vaccine strain. Laboratory tests indicated that after one dose of immunization of this vaccine, chickens could develop an over than 40 weeks protective immune response against H5N1 virus challenge.

Newcastle disease (ND) is an OIE listed disease caused by virulent avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1) strains, which is enzootic and causes large economic losses in the poultry sector. Genotype VII and genotype IX NDV viruses were the predominant circulating genotype in China, which may possibly be responsible for disease outbreaks in chicken flocks in recent years. While ducks and geese usually have exhibited inapparent infections.

An evolutionary analysis was conducted of 354 hemagglutinin (HA) and 208 neuraminidase (NA) genes, including newly generated sequences of 5 HA and 30 NA, of Egyptian H5N1 clade 2.2.1 viruses isolated from poultry and humans. Five distinct phylogenetically distinguishable clusters arose from a monophyletic origin since 2006. Only two clusters remained in circulation after 2009: (i) A cluster of viruses arose in 2007 in industrial-vaccinated chickens and carried multiple mutations in or adjacent to the immunogenic epitopes of the HA. Viruses within this cluster evolved with significantly elevated mutation rates indicating persisting selective pressures, e.g. to escape host immunity and (ii) The second group arose in 2008 and harboured strains from recent human infections featuring a conspicuous deletion in the HA receptor-binding domain and substitutions close to the highly conserved active site of the NA. In both sublineages, a number of positively selected amino acids, different glycosylation patterns and variations in the polybasic proteolytic cleavage site were observed. Continuous monitoring of the evolving H5N1 virus in Egypt is essential to develop new control campaigns in poultry and human population.

Emperor geese (Anser canagicus) are endemic to coastal areas within Beringia and have previously been found to have antibodies to or to be infected with influenza A viruses (IAVs) in Alaska. In this study, we use virological, serological and tracking data to further elucidate the role of emperor geese in the ecology of IAVs in Beringia during the non-breeding period. Specifically, we assess evidence for: (a) active IAV infection during spring staging, autumn staging and wintering periods; (b) infection with novel Eurasian-origin or interhemispheric reassortant viruses; (c) contemporary movement of geese between East Asia and North America; (d) previous exposure to viruses of 14 haemagglutinin subtypes, including Eurasian lineage highly pathogenic (HP) H5 IAVs; and (e) subtype-specific antibody seroconversion and seroreversion. Emperor geese were found to shed IAVs, including interhemispheric reassortant viruses, throughout the non-breeding period; migrate between Alaska and the Russian Far East prior to and following remigial moult; have antibodies reactive to a diversity of IAVs including, in a few instances, Eurasian lineage HP H5 IAVs; and exhibit relatively broad and stable patterns of population immunity among breeding females. Results of this study suggest that emperor geese may play an important role in the maintenance and dispersal of IAVs within Beringia during the non-breeding period and provide information that may be used to further optimize surveillance activities focused on the early detection of Eurasian-origin IAVs in North America.

During a recent epizootic, losses due to West Nile virus (WNV) infection in young goose flocks were estimated to be far greater than expected if mosquito-borne transmission was the principal route of infection. Contact transmission was investigated experimentally as an alternative explanation. A group of 10, 3-week-old geese were inoculated subcutaneously and placed in one insect-proof room with 20 geese of the same age. A group of 10 geese were housed in an adjacent insect-proof room to serve as an environmental control. All geese in the inoculated group produced antibodies, eight became viraemic and five died between 7 and 10 days after infection. Virus was shed from the cloaca and oral cavity by three geese. Two of the in-contact birds died on days 10 and 17 after infection, and WNV was recovered from another three birds. None of the environmental control group became infected. This result strongly suggests that horizontal transmission of WNV can occur in commercial flocks and may be aggravated if cannibalism and feather-picking of sick geese occur.

During an epornitic of velogenic viscerotropic Newcastle disease (VVND) in southern California, free-flying wild birds, captive and free-ranging semidomestic birds, and exotic birds were collected from the quarantine area to determine their role in the epizootiology of the disease. The VVND virus was isolated from 0.04% of 9,446 free-flying wild birds, 0.76% of 4,367 semidomestic birds, and 1.01% of 3,780 exotic birds examined. Three house sparrows and 1 crow directly associated with infected poultry flocks were the only free-flying wild birds from which VVND virus was isolated. Among semidomestic species, ducks, quail, chukars, pheasants, peafowl, pigeons, and doves were found to be infected. Psttacines, pittas, and toucans accounted for 92% of the VVND virus isolations from exotic birds. In addition, domestic Newcastle disease virus (NDV) was isolated from 0.29% of the free-flying wild birds, from 1.65% of the semidomestic birds, and from 0.19% of the exotic birds collected. Hemagglutination-inhibition against domestic NDV was demonstrated in 0.24% of 3,796 wild bird serums, 8.28% of 2,004 semidomestic bird serums, and 3.90% of 231 exotic bird serums tested. Although few free-flying wild birds were infected with VVND virus in this epornitic, the isolation of domestic NDV strains from free-flying wild ducks and mourning doves suggests the potential for transportation of NDV over long distances by migratory birds.

Since 1997, outbreaks of highly pathogenic (HP) H5N1 and circulation of H9N2 viruses among domestic poultry in Asia have posed a threat to public health. To better understand the extent of transmission of avian influenza viruses (AIV) to humans in Asia, we conducted a cross-sectional virologic study in live bird markets (LBM) in Hanoi, Vietnam, in October 2001. Specimens from 189 birds and 18 environmental samples were collected at 10 LBM. Four influenza A viruses of the H4N6 (n = 1), H5N2 (n = 1), and H9N3 (n = 2) subtypes were isolated from healthy ducks for an isolation frequency of over 30% from this species. Two H5N1 viruses were isolated from healthy geese. The hemagglutinin (HA) genes of these H5N1 viruses possessed multiple basic amino acid motifs at the cleavage site, were HP for experimentally infected chickens, and were thus characterized as HP AIV. These HA genes shared high amino acid identities with genes of other H5N1 viruses isolated in Asia during this period, but they were genetically distinct from those of H5N1 viruses isolated from poultry and humans in Vietnam during the early 2004 outbreaks. These viruses were not highly virulent for experimentally infected ducks, mice, or ferrets. These results establish that HP H5N1 viruses with properties similar to viruses isolated in Hong Kong and mainland China circulated in Vietnam as early as 2001, suggest a common source for H5N1 viruses circulating in these Asian countries, and provide a framework to better understand the recent widespread emergence of HP H5N1 viruses in Asia.

Seventy-nine Newcastle disease viruses (NDV) isolated from clinical specimens of different poultry species including chickens, pigeons (Columba livia), geese and ostriches in Eastern China during 2005-2008 were characterized biologically and phylogenetically. The results showed genetic diversity of these viruses: three class I viruses and one genotype I and 12 genotype II viruses of class II circulating in chickens were avirulent; four genotype VIb viruses isolated from pigeons were moderately virulent; and two genotype III viruses and 57 genotype VIId viruses were highly virulent. The three class I viruses were further classified as genotypes 2 and 3. The very high F protein sequence identity of one genotype I virus with strain Queensland V4 and 12 genotype II viruses with strain La Sota indicated that these viruses originated from the two vaccine strains. Two genotype III viruses shared greater than 99% sequence identity with the moderately virulent vaccine strain Mukteswar but exhibited significantly higher virulence, suggesting that they evolved from the vaccine virus and that the Mukteswar vaccine should be banned in China. Fifty-seven of the 63 virulent NDVs in this study belonged to genotype VIId, indicating its predominance in Eastern China. Genotype VIId viruses could be further classified into two subgroups. Four of the five NDVs isolated from pigeons belonged to genotype VIb, indicating its host-specific preference. Both the genotype VIb and VIId NDVs showed low amino acid similarity to the vaccine strains currently used in China, implying the urgent need to develop better vaccines against the most prevalent NDVs in China.

In January 2004, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus of the H5N1 subtype was first confirmed in poultry and humans in Thailand. Control measures, e.g., culling poultry flocks, restricting poultry movement, and improving hygiene, were implemented. Poultry populations in 1,417 villages in 60 of 76 provinces were affected in 2004. A total of 83% of infected flocks confirmed by laboratories were backyard chickens (56%) or ducks (27%). Outbreaks were concentrated in the Central, the southern part of the Northern, and Eastern Regions of Thailand, which are wetlands, water reservoirs, and dense poultry areas. More than 62 million birds were either killed by HPAI viruses or culled. H5N1 virus from poultry caused 17 human cases and 12 deaths in Thailand; a number of domestic cats, captive tigers, and leopards also died of the H5N1 virus. In 2005, the epidemic is ongoing in Thailand.

All 16 subtypes of avian influenza viruses of low pathogenicity (LPAIV) as well as their hemagglutinin (H) antigens, and four 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus isolates were assayed for hemagglutinating activity against 5 erythrocyte species: goose, guinea pig, human group O, chicken and horse. Of all viruses and antigens assayed, the highest hemagglutination (HA) titers were obtained with goose and guinea pig erythrocytes. Hemagglutinating activity of replicating LPAIV and LPAIV antigens decreased, in order, with chicken and human group O; meanwhile, horse erythrocytes yielded lowest or no HA titer. Moreover, the 2009 pandemic viruses did not agglutinate both horse and chicken erythrocytes. Our study concluded that goose and guinea pig erythrocytes are the best in HA assay for all subtypes of influenza viruses.

Duck viral enteritis (DVE) outbreaks occurred at two different locations in Pennsylvania in 1991 and 1992. In the first outbreak, four ducks died out of a group of 30 domestic ducks; in the second outbreak, 65 ducks died out of a group of 114 domestic ducks, and 15 domestic geese died as well. A variety of species of ducks were present on both premises, but only muscovy ducks (Cairina moschata) died from the disease. On necropsy, gross lesions included hepatomegaly with petechial hemorrhages, petechial hemorrhages in the abdominal fat, petechial hemorrhages on the epicardial surface of the heart, and multifocal to coalescing areas of fibrinonecrotic material over the mucosal surface of the trachea, esophagus, intestine, and cloaca. Histologically, the liver had random multifocal areas of necrosis and eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies in hepatocytes. DVE virus was isolated and identified using muscovy duck embryo fibroblast inoculation and virus neutralization.

Serum antibodies reactive to clusters of intracytoplasmic A particles in mouse mammary tumors and leukemia cells by means of an indirect immunofluorescence assay were detected in 11 mammalian species (ranging in frequency from 5.1 to 29.3%). These antibodies could not be found in sera from chicken, ducks and geese. Their presence in so many mammalian species, not only in mammary tumor virus-infected mice, sheds new light on similar antibodies in man detected 10 years ago.

Absorption of stable 65Cu incorporated intrinsically or extrinsically into foods was studied in women fed a diet marginal in Cu content. Isotopic enrichment was 73.1 +/- 1.0 atom percent 65Cu in goose breast meat, 74.9 +/- 0.5 atom percent in goose liver, and 55-69.5 atom percent in two crops of peanuts. Seven women were fed a basal diet containing 1.25 mg Cu/d. At 4-wk intervals, they were fed test meals over a 3-d period; each set of meals contained one of the labeled test foods in amounts with similar copper content. Absorption of 65Cu from intrinsically labeled liver was (mean +/- SD) 65 +/- 4%; extrinsic liver, 65 +/- 10%; E/I = 1.00 +/- 0.16. 65Cu absorption from intrinsically labeled goose breast meat was 54 +/- 6%; extrinsic meat, 52 +/- 10%; E/I = 0.97 +/- 0.18. 65Cu absorption from intrinsically labeled peanut butter was 58 +/- 15%; extrinsic peanut butter, 54 +/- 10%; E/I = 0.93 +/- 0.11. 65Cu absorption from extrinsically labeled sunflower butter was 50 +/- 2%. There were no differences in absorption of intrinsic and extrinsic Cu from these foods. Absorption of Cu was significantly higher from goose liver than from goose meat or sunflower butter (P less than 0.05). With a dietary intake of 1.25 +/- 0.20 mg Cu/d, Cu balance, exclusive of surface losses, was essentially zero (0.01 +/- 0.13 mg/d) in the seven subjects.

During an avian cholera epornitic, between December 1982 and January 1983, 58 dead, 23 sick, and 106 hunter-killed lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) were collected at Delevan National Wildlife Refuge, Colusa County, California, USA. Fifty-one of the dead and sick geese were infected with Pasteurella multocida. Lead concentrations in the livers ranged from < 1 to 253 parts per million (ppm) (dry weight). Lead concentrations in the kidneys ranged from < 1 ppm to 547 ppm (dry weight). Snow geese with > 30 ppm lead, considered diagnostic of acute lead poisoning, had significantly (P < 0.05) lower heart weights and a smaller band of heart fat, compared to geese with tissue lead concentrations of < 30 ppm. Tissue lead concentrations in geese dying from avian cholera generally were lower than concentrations in hunter-killed geese, but the differences were not significant for either kidney (P = 0.08) or liver (P = 0.30) tissue.

Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular coccidian parasite found worldwide and is known to infect virtually all warm-blooded animals. It requires a cat (family Felidae) to complete its full life cycle. Despite the absence of wild felids on the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, T. gondii has been found in resident predators such as the arctic fox and polar bear. It has therefore been suggested that T. gondii may enter this ecosystem via migratory birds. The objective of this study was to identify locations where goose populations may become infected with T. gondii, and to investigate the dynamics of T. gondii specific antibodies. Single blood samples of both adults and juveniles were collected from selected goose species (Anser anser, A. brachyrhynchus, Branta canadensis, B. leucopsis) at Arctic brood-rearing areas in Russia and on Svalbard, and temperate wintering grounds in the Netherlands and Denmark (migratory populations) as well as temperate brood-rearing grounds (the Netherlands, non-migratory populations). A modified agglutination test was used on serum, for detection of antibodies against T. gondii. Occasional repeated annual sampling of individual adults was performed to determine the antibody dynamics. Adults were found seropositive at all locations (Arctic and temperate, brood-rearing and wintering grounds) with low seroprevalence in brood-rearing birds on temperate grounds. As no juvenile geese were found seropositive at any brood-rearing location, but nine month old geese were found seropositive during spring migration we conclude that geese, irrespective of species and migration, encounter T. gondii infection in wintering areas. In re-sampled birds on Svalbard significant seroreversion was observed, with 42% of seropositive adults showing no detectable antibodies after 12 months, while the proportion of seroconversion was only 3%. Modelled variation of seroprevalence with field data on antibody longevity and parasite transmission suggests seroprevalence of a population within a range of 5.2-19.9%, in line with measured values. The high occurrence of seroreversion compared to the low occurrence of seroconversion hampers analysis of species- or site-specific patterns, but explains the absence of an increase in seroprevalence with age and the observed variation in antibody titre. These findings imply that even though infection rate is low, adults introduce T. gondii to the high Arctic ecosystem following infection in temperate regions.

During 1999 and 2000, a disease outbreak of West Nile (WN) virus occurred in humans, horses, and wild and zoological birds in the northeastern USA. In our experiments, WN virus infection of young domestic geese (Anser anser domesticus) caused depression, weight loss, torticollis, opisthotonus, and death with accompanying encephalitis and myocarditis. Based on this experimental study and a field outbreak in Israel, WN virus is a disease threat to young goslings and viremia levels are potentially sufficient to infect mosquitoes and transmit WN virus to other animal species.

In April 2014, poor fertility in a major commercial goose breeder operation in California triggered the submission of six live affected Toulouse ganders ( Anser anser ) to the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory, Turlock branch (University of California-Davis). Toulouse were principally affected among all breeds, and their egg fertility dropped from 65.7% to less than 33.9% in the first 40 days of the 2014 breeding season. The flock consisted of 410 adult birds, 90 males and 320 females, between 2 and 5 yr of age. Inspection of the flock revealed that 44.4% of the Toulouse ganders had severe phallic deformities that prevented them from mating. At postmortem examination, severe yellowish fibrocaseous exudate disrupted the architecture of the phallus and occasionally produced fistulating tracts through the wall of the organ. Microscopically, multifocal lymphoid nodules were noted in the mucosa and submucosa of the phallus and were associated with extensive granulomatous reaction, intralesional bacteria, and spermatozoa. Mycoplasma spp. were isolated from the phallus of affected and nonaffected birds, and PCR protocols targeting the 16S-23S ribosomal RNA intergenic spacer regions and the RNA polymerase beta subunit gene were performed to identify the isolates. Three distinct species were identified on sequencing and analysis using the National Center for Biotechnology Information basic local alignment search tool: Mycoplasma cloacale , Mycoplasma anseris , and an unknown novel Mycoplasma sp. Additionally, Pasteurella multocida , in combination with other bacteria, was also isolated from the phallic lesions and identified as serotype 3 with a DNA profile of 1511 (National Veterinary Service Laboratory). This is the first report of these Mycoplasma spp. and other bacteria associated with reproductive disease in ganders in the United States.

Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by H5N1 viruses were reported almost simultaneously in eight neighbouring Asian countries between December 2003 and January 2004, with a ninth reporting in August 2004, suggesting that the viruses had spread recently and rapidly. However, they had been detected widely in the region in domestic waterfowl and terrestrial poultry for several years before this, and the absence of widespread disease in the region before 2003, apart from localised outbreaks in the Hong Kong Special Autonomous Region (SAR), is perplexing. Possible explanations include limited virus excretion by domestic waterfowl infected with H5N1, the confusion of avian influenza with other serious endemic diseases, the unsanctioned use of vaccines, and the under-reporting of disease as a result of limited surveillance. There is some evidence that the excretion of the viruses by domestic ducks had increased by early 2004, and there is circumstantial evidence that they can be transmitted by wild birds. The migratory birds from which viruses have been isolated were usually sick or dead, suggesting that they would have had limited potential for carrying the viruses over long distances unless subclinical infections were prevalent. However, there is strong circumstantial evidence that wild birds can become infected from domestic poultry and potentially can exchange viruses when they share the same environment. Nevertheless, there is little reason to believe that wild birds have played a more significant role in spreading disease than trade through live bird markets and movement of domestic waterfowl. Asian H5N1 viruses were first detected in domestic geese in southern China in 1996. By 2000, their host range had extended to domestic ducks, which played a key role in the genesis of the 2003/04 outbreaks. The epidemic was not due to the introduction and spread of a single virus but was caused by multiple viruses which were genotypically linked to the Goose/GD/96 lineage via the haemagglutinin gene. The H5N1 viruses isolated from China, including the Hong Kong SAR, between 1999 and 2004 had a range of genotypes and considerable variability within genotypes. The rising incidence and widespread reporting of disease in 2003/04 can probably be attributed to the increasing spread of the viruses from existing reservoirs of infection in domestic waterfowl and live bird markets leading to greater environmental contamination. When countries in the region started to report disease in December 2003, others were alerted to the risk and disease surveillance and reporting improved. The H5N1 viruses have reportedly been eliminated from three of the nine countries that reported disease in 2003/04, but they could be extremely difficult to eradicate from the remaining countries, owing to the existence of populations and, possibly, production and marketing sectors, in which apparently normal birds harbour the viruses.

We analysed the role of neuraminidase (NA) on haemadsorption by the haemagglutinin (HA) protein of influenza B virus. The influenza B virus mutant ts-7 has a temperature-sensitive mutation in the NA protein. At high temperature, cells infected with this virus did not exhibit haemadsorption activity, but the addition of bacterial neuraminidase (bNA) restored haemadsorption activity. COS cells transfected with HA cDNAs of B/Kanagawa/73 or B/Lee/40 virus showed no evidence of haemadsorption. However, with the addition of bNA or co- transfection with NA cDNA of the B/Lee/40 virus, haemadsorption was observed. Experiments with point-mutated HA cDNAs of B/Lee/40 virus showed that two N-acetyl glycosylation sites at amino acid residues 160 and 217 were responsible for the inability of the HA protein to adsorb to erythrocytes. These results indicated that haemadsorption by the HA protein of influenza B virus required the involvement of NA. Because the NA inhibitor Zanamivir was reported not to penetrate cells, we investigated the action of this inhibitor and found that Zanamivir inhibited haemadsorption on MDCK cells infected with B/Kanagawa/73 or B/Lee/40 virus. After removing Zanamivir by washing, the addition of bNA restored the haemadsorption activity on the infected cells. Scanning electron microscopy indicated that at 0.4 microM Zanamivir, HA protein did not adsorb to erythrocytes but retained the ability to aggregate virions. However, at 4 microM Zanamivir, distinct virion formation could not be observed.

Recent outbreaks of haemorrhagic nephritis enteritis in geese flocks of 3 to 10 weeks in age in Hungary were investigated. Mortality varied between 4% and 67%. Affected birds generally died suddenly. Occasional clinical signs included tremors of the head and neck, subcutaneous haemorrhages and excretion of faeces containing partly digested blood. At necropsy the most frequent findings were a turgid wall and reddish mucosa of the intestines and reddish discolouration of the swollen kidneys, but oedema and haemorrhages of the subcutaneous connective tissue, hydropericardium and ascites were also seen. In subacute cases, visceral gout was frequently observed. Histological examination revealed zonal necrosis of the tubular epithelial cells with haemorrhages in the kidney. Other histological findings were serous hepatitis with fatty infiltration, necrotizing haemorrhagic enteritis and haemorrhages in the different organs including the brain. Experimental geese infected parenterally with crude liver and spleen homogenates prepared from diseased birds died after 8 to 20 days without premonitory signs, and had typical gross and histological lesions. Attempts to isolate cytopathic virus on different tissue cultures failed. The presence of polyomavirus was proven by polymerase chain reaction. Five isolates were further investigated by analysing their complete VP1 gene sequence. All tested strains were very closely related to each other on the basis of the nucleotide sequence, and they were identical at the deduced amino acid level.

Twenty-nine strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolated from outbreaks in chicken and goose flocks in several regions of China during 1985-2001 were characterized pathotypically and genotypically. All except one of these strains were velogenic. For genotyping, phylogenetic tree analysis (nt 47-420), restriction site mapping (nt 334-1682) and residue substitution analysis (residues 4-124) of the F gene were performed using sequences of our isolates and sequences of selected NDV strains from GenBank. The results revealed that most of these newly characterized strains belonged to six novel genetic groups that were designated as VIf, VIg, VIIc, VIId, VIIe and IX. The genotype IX viruses, to which the China challenge strain F48E8 used for vaccine evaluation belonged, were found only in China and still induced sporadic infections in certain areas. Isolates belonging to group VIf and VIg were distinct from previously reported members of genotype VI, with genetic distance from 2.5 to 12.1%. Subgenotype VIIc, VIId and VIIe viruses, which were distributed in clusters in the phylogenetic tree distinct from members of subgenotypes VIIa and VIIb, were responsible for disease outbreaks in chicken and goose flocks and circulated predominantly in southern China in recent years. Finally, cross-protective testing showed that specific-pathogen free (SPF) chickens vaccinated with La Sota vaccines can be fully protected against challenge by strains from genetic groups VIb, VIg, VIId and IX, indicating that the antigenic differences between strains of various genotypes are insufficient to change the cross-protection conferred by the commonly used vaccine.

This study investigated the impact of waterfowl on the bacteriological quality of village ponds in East Yorkshire, north-east England. Water and sediment samples were collected from ponds with and without resident ducks and geese; faecal indicator and potentially pathogenic bacteria were assayed by membrane filtration and by selective enrichment. Escherichia coli, faecal streptococci and, to a degree, Clostridium perfringens were more abundant in ponds with waterfowl; Salmonella was isolated in June-August from the sediment of a pond with waterfowl. The results suggested that the bacteriological quality of village ponds might be adversely affected by waterfowl. All water samples from ponds with waterfowl had faecal indicators at higher concentrations than EU requirements for bathing waters. Although these ponds are not bathing waters we suggest skin contact and accidental ingestion of water should be avoided.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus hemagglutinin (HAin) was readily adsorbed on mouse erythrocytes at 4, 22, or 37 degrees C, but not on goose erythrocytes. The adsorbed HAin could not be eluted from the cells by resuspending in phosphate buffered saline, by incubating at 37 or 50 degrees C, or by incubating in the presence of neuraminidase. The hemagglutinating activity was not dependent on the pH and NaCl molarity tested. The receptor of mouse erythrocytes for the HAin was relatively stable to trypsin, neuraminidase, sodium deoxycholate (DOC), potassium periodate (KIO4), dithiothreitol (DTT), 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) and formalin treatments. The HAin was inactivated by 2-ME and was gradually inactivated by pepsin, formalin and DTT, but not by beta-glucosidase, trypsin, alpha-amylase, papain, phospholipase C, neuraminidase, KIO4, and ethylendiamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) treatments. The HAin was stable at 37 degrees C or lower temperatures, but not at 56 degrees C or higher. The HAin was relatively resistant to ultraviolet irradiation and sonication. In the equilibrium centrifugation of the HAin preparation on a CsCl density gradient, the HAin activity showed a sharp peak at 1.17 g/cm2. In the SDS-PAGE analysis, the structural polypeptide of HAin in the peak fraction seems to be the nucleocapsid (N) polypeptide with molecular weight of 15 kDa.

Duck virus enteritis (DVE) is an acute and contagious herpes virus infection of duck, geese and swans with high morbidity and mortality. The development of specific mucosal immune system against duck enteritis virus (DEV) infection for ducks has been hindered by a lack of knowledge concerning the purification of immunoglobulin A (IgA) of duck. In the present work, the method for purification of duck immunoglobulin A was developed, and the induction of intestinal mucosal immune responses against DEV was studied by orally infected ducklings with virulent DEV. The results showed that a continuous increased DEV DNA levels were observed in blood and various organs examined of orally infected ducklings throughout the infection, which was accompanied by the development of infection in ducklings from mild progressed to severe pathological lesions. Furthermore, a marked increased level of DEV-specific IgA and IgG antibodies in bile, serum and the intestinal tract, as well as the density of IgA(+) cells in intestine were detected between 1 and 12days p.i., followed by a drastic reduction of the antibody levels and the density of IgA(+) cells at 15days p.i. The results indicate that the DVE infection can stimulate both IgA-dominated antibody immune responses in the intestinal tract, and IgG-dominated antibody systemic immunity in the serum of ducklings orally inoculated with virulent DEV. The severe lesions of the villus epithelial cells and the lymphoid organs can suppress the intestinal mucosal immune responses.

A recent epizootic outbreak, in China, of duck beak atrophy and dwarfism syndrome (BADS) was investigated using electron microscopic, genetic, and virological studies, which identified a parvovirus with a greater similarity to goose parvovirus (GPV) (97% protein homology) than to Muscovy duck parvovirus (MDPV) (90% protein homology). The new virus, provisionally designated GPV-QH15, was found to be antigenically more closely related to GPV than to MDPV in a virus neutralization assay. These findings were further supported by phylogenetic analysis showing that GPV-QH15 evolved from goose lineage parvoviruses, rather than from Muscovy duck- or other duck species-related parvoviruses. In all, two genetic lineages (GPV I and GPV II) were identified from the GPV samples analyzed, and GPV-QH15 was found to be closely clustered with two known goose-origin parvoviruses (GPVa2006 and GPV1995), together forming a distinctive GPV IIa sublineage. Finally, structural modeling revealed that GPV-QH15 and the closely related viruses GPVa2006 and GPV1995 possessed identical clusters of receptor-interacting amino acid residues in the VP2 protein, a major determinant of viral receptor binding and host specificity. Significantly, these three viruses differed from MDPVs and other GPVs at these positions. Taken together, these results suggest that GPV-QH15 represents a new variant of goose-origin parvovirus that currently circulates in ducklings and causes BADS, a syndrome reported previously in Europe. This new finding highlights the need for future surveillance of GPV-QH15 in poultry in order to gain a better understanding of both the evolution and the biology of this emerging parvovirus.

Migratory waterfowl play an important role in the maintenance and spread of zoonotic diseases worldwide. An example is cercarial dermatitis, caused when larval stages of schistosomes that normally develop in birds penetrate human skin. Members of the genus Trichobilharzia (Schistosomatidae), transmitted mainly by ducks, are considered to be major etiological agents of cercarial dermatitis globally. To better understand the diversity and distribution of Trichobilharzia spp., we surveyed ducks from the United States, eastern Canada, Argentina, South Africa and New Zealand. To aid in species identification of the Trichobilharzia worms recovered, regions of the Cox1, ND4 and ITS1 were sequenced. Furthermore, we provide molecular phylogenetic evidence for the cosmopolitan distribution and trans-hemispheric gene flow for one species, Trichobilharzia querquedulae, previously thought to be restricted to North America. These new samples from endemic non-migratory duck species indicate that T. querquedulae transmission occurs within each of the regions we sampled and that it is specific to the blue-winged+silver teal duck clade. Prevalence within this host group is >95% across the known range of T. querquedulae, indicating that transmission is common. Genetic divergence is evenly distributed among continents, and no phylogenetic structure associated with geography was observed. The results provide strong support for the global distribution and transmission of T. querquedulae and represent, to our knowledge, the first report of a cosmopolitan schistosome confirmed by genetic data. These data are the first known to support trans-hemispheric genetic exchange in a species responsible for causing cercarial dermatitis, indicating that the epidemiology of this group of poorly known zoonotic parasites is more complex than previously expected.

Since 2013, there have been several alarming influenza-related events; the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5 viruses into North America, the detection of H10N8 and H5N6 zoonotic infections, the ongoing H7N9 infections in China and the continued zoonosis of H5N1 viruses in parts of Asia and the Middle East. The risk of a new influenza pandemic increases with the repeated interspecies transmission events that facilitate reassortment between animal influenza strains; thus, it is of utmost importance to understand the factors involved that promote or become a barrier to cross-species transmission of Influenza A viruses (IAVs). Here, we provide an overview of the ecology and evolutionary adaptations of IAVs, with a focus on a review of the molecular factors that enable interspecies transmission of the various virus gene segments.

Bluetongue-virus (BTV) was found to agglutinate a variety of erythrocytes including sheep-, chicken-, guinea pig- and mouse-erythrocytes. Hemagglutination was inhibited specifically with type specific serum. A temperature dependence was only found for chicken erythrocytes, which showed a hemagglutination optimum at 37 degrees C. The hemagglutination was lost upon treatment of the virus with 0.4% trypsin as well as after treatment with 0.01 M KJO4. Heating of the virus preparation to 56 degrees C resulted in the loss of the HA-activity. Gelchromatographic studies indicated that the hemagglutinating capacity is associated with the complete virion. Whereas virulent strains of BTV hemagglutinate a number of different erythrocytes the avirulent type tested produced only a slight hemagglutination with sheep red blood cells. However, specific antiserum produced with the avirulent strain yielded strong hemagglutination inhibition (HI) with the corresponding virulent strain. Treatment of sera prior to their use in the HI proved necessary to remove nonspecific inhibitors. The efficiency of KJO4 in removing nonspecific inhibitors. The efficiency of KJO4 in removing nonspecific inhibitors indicates that carbohydrates represent the major group of nonspecific inhibitors. The data represented recommended the hemagglutination inhibition tests as a new method to identify the various BTV serotypes.

Comparative studies have been carried out on the blood of certain laboratory and farm animals and birds, whereby the activity of muramidase (lysozyme) is established in neutrophilic cells of mice, guinea pigs, rats, rabbits, dogs, hens, turkeys and geese and in the monocytes of rabbits and dogs. The percentage of cells with muramidase activity manifests species features. No cells with a presence of muramidase activity have been found in the perypheral blood of cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, horses and bullalos. Certain questions of a general biological aspect about the origin of muramidase in the blood serum are examined on the basis of the results obtained and recent data from analyses of human blood.

As part of an investigation of an encephalitis outbreak in New York City, we sampled 430 birds, representing 18 species in four orders, during September 13-23, 1999, in Queens and surrounding counties. Overall, 33% were positive for West Nile (WN) virus-neutralizing antibodies, and 0.5% were positive for St. Louis encephalitis virus-neutralizing antibodies. By county, Queens had the most seropositive birds for WN virus (50%); species with the greatest seropositivity for WN virus (sample sizes were at least six) were Domestic Goose, Domestic Chicken, House Sparrow, Canada Goose, and Rock Dove. One sampled bird, a captive adult Domestic Goose, showed signs of illness; WN virus infection was confirmed. Our results support the concept that chickens and House Sparrows are good arbovirus sentinels. This study also implicates the House Sparrow as an important vertebrate reservoir host.

Multiple infections of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in poultry or wild birds contribute to the continued evolution of H5 subtype viruses in nature and provide potential recombination of AIVs of different origins. In this study, we carried out surveillance of AIVs in ducks, geese and the environment of a community in Hunan province, China, from 2014-2015. We isolated multiple co-circulated AIVs including H3N2, H3N8, and H5N6, and, most importantly, a novel reassortant: H3N6. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that H3N6 is highly likely derived from H5N6, which has recently been shown to have zoonotic potential with human infections. Studies with mammalian cell lines and a mouse model indicate that four selected AIVs of duck or goose origin can infect MDCK and A549 cells but have low pathogenicity in mice. We propose that a potential co-circulation of multiple subtypes including H5N6 in local area may result in the production of novel subtypes such as H3N6 by gene reassortment.

miRNAs are single-stranded, small RNA molecules with a length of 18-25 nucleotides. They bind to the 3' untranslated regions of mRNA transcripts to reduce the translation of these transcripts or to cause their degradation. The roles of these molecules differ in biological processes, such as cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis and tumor genesis. miRNA-33 is encoded by the gene introns of proteins that bind sterol-regulatory elements. This molecule cooperates with these proteins to control cholesterol homeostasis, fatty acid levels and the genes that are related to the expression of fat metabolism. The examination of miR-33 expression and its target genes can promote the in-depth study of the miRNA regulation mechanism in the formation process of goose fatty liver and can lay a foundation for research into human fatty liver.

Polyclonal antibodies (PAbs) raised in geese and eight mice hybridomas secreting monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against the goose parvovirus (GPV) were prepared. They were used for development of immunofluorescence (IF) and immunoelectron-microscopic (IEM) techniques to demonstrate the GPV infection in infected organs and biological fluids. The GPV antigens were established by immunofluorescence within the nuclei and the cytoplasm of many infected cells of the chorioallantoic membrane of goose and Peckin duck embryos, liver and heart of mortally diseased goslings. By means of IEM it was possible to detect the GPV in native organ homogenate supernatants and allantoic fluids. All techniques used in the study could be successfully applied for rapid diagnosis of the GPV infection. The test systems on the basis of MAbs should, however, be preferred. By means of immunoblotting (IB) using PAbs and MAbs four viral proteins (VP) with MW 88, 77, 65 and 60 kDa were demonstrated. Contrary to the others the VP with MW 65 kDa was the most antigenically reactive though invisible in the SDS-PAGE and Coomassie-blue dye-stained preparations.

Studied was the biochemical activity of a total of 168 strains of Pasteurella--73 isolated from birds (48 from cases of acute fowl cholera, and 25--of chronic cholera), and 95 isolated from mammals (3 from lambs, 24 from pigs, 36 from cattle, and 32 from rabbits) with regard to the tests determining the hemolytic activity, production of indol, reduction of nitrates, breakdown of urea, beta galactosidase activity, production of hydrogen sulfide, ornitin-, arginine-, lysine-decarboxylase-, and phosphatase activity, and the fermentation of substrates such as manite, glucose, galactose, saccharose, manose, levulose, dulcite, lactose, maltose, rafinose, trechalose, salicin, melobiose, icelobiose, arabinose, xylose, and sorbite. To differentiate Pasteurella multocida strains isolated from mamals from those isolated from birds the phosphatase activity test on solid media with sodium phenolphtalein diphosphate had to be employed Pasteurella organisms isolated from mammals showed positive phosphatase activity, while those isolated from birds exhibited a negative one. Arabinose and xylose fermentation tests could simultaneously be used. Pasteurellae isolated in cases of acute fowl cholera showed positive reaction for arabinose and a negative one for xylose, while the strains isolated from mammals showed the reverse activity. The strains isolated in cases of chronic fowl cholera were shown to belong to this group.

Concern over lead poisoning led to progressive prohibition of toxic shot to harvest waterfowl in the 1980's. Nevertheless, waterfowl remain susceptible to ingestion of lead shot because illegal use continues and spent shot persists in soil and wetland substrates. While mortality due to lead toxicosis has subsided, sublethal effects may still affect survival and reproduction. We measured liver lead levels and body condition in 732 Canada geese (Branta canadensis interior) during July 1984 to April 1989 in southern Illinois (USA), east-central Wisconsin (USA), and northern Ontario (Canada). Although we sampled only individuals that were visibly healthy, 55 of 732 (7.5%) geese had elevated liver lead levels (> 2 ppm). Lead levels of 46 (6.3%) geese indicated subclinical poisoning (2-6 ppm) and 9 (1.2%) geese had lead levels indicative of clinical poisoning (> 6 ppm). A greater proportion of juveniles (14.3%) had elevated lead levels than did adults (6.0%), but there was no difference between genders. Lead levels were highest in autumn and winter in southern Illinois, but were low during nesting and summer, despite legal use of lead shot in northern Ontario during our study. Lead poisoning (> or = 5% of the population) was still evident during all seasons in juveniles, and during autumn and winter in adults, 5 to 10 yr after toxic shot was banned from areas where we collected geese during migration and winter. Elevated lead levels did not affect total body mass, lipid reserves, or mineral levels of geese we collected. Protein levels also were unaffected below 10 ppm, but there was evidence of decline at higher concentrations. Thus, it seems unlikely that lead exposure currently affects survival or reproduction of Mississippi Valley Population (MVP) geese via body condition, although other sublethal effects cannot be discounted.

Cytochrome P-450 2C45 (CYP2C45) is the most highly expressed cytochrome P-450 isoform in chicken liver, and may play an important role in avian liver biology. However, information regarding the function of CYP2C45 in fatty liver is generally limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of CYP2C45 during the development of goose fatty liver. Our result indicated that the transcription of CYP2C45, together with PK and ALOX5, was increased in goose liver upon overfeeding for 19 D (P < 0.05). In goose primary hepatocytes, CYP2C45 RNA expression was also upgraded by the treatment with various chemicals like insulin, the fatty acids, and PPAR agonists (P < 0.05). We also found that both CYP2C45 overexpression and troglitazone treatment could increase the expression of pyruvate kinase (PK) and arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5), and furthermore, showed that the up-regulation of PK and ALOX5 induced by troglitazone could be suppressed by small interfering RNAs targeting CYP2C45 (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that fatty acids treatment and the overfeeding can induce the up-regulation of CYP2C45 expression possibly via PPARγ and that the induction of PK and ALOX5 in goose fatty liver is at least partially attributed to fatty acid-induced expression of CYP2C45. Thus, our data provides an insight into the mechanism by which glycolysis and arachidonic acid metabolism are modulated in goose fatty liver.

We have identified the etiological agent of hemorrhagic nephritis enteritis of geese (HNEG), a fatal disease of European geese. HNEG has been recognized in almost all goose breeding areas, with an epizootic pattern, and up to now, the infectious agent has remained unknown. In order to identify the causative agent, infected tissues from HNEG-affected geese were inoculated to 1-day-old goslings, which then developed clinical signs typical of HNEG. Tissue homogenates from these birds were subjected to Freon extraction followed by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. The resulting main band was examined by electron microscopy and consisted of spherical, naked, papovavirus-like particles approximately 45 nm in diameter. The virus was isolated and propagated in goose kidney cell primary culture. Tissue- or culture-purified virus allowed the experimental reproduction of the disease in goslings. Random PCR amplification of viral nucleic acid produced a 1,175-bp fragment which was shown to be associated with field samples collected from geese affected by HNEG on commercial farms in France. Sequence analysis of the PCR product revealed a unique open reading frame, showing 63 to 72% amino acid similarity with the major capsid protein (VP1) of several polyomaviruses. Finally, based on phylogenetic analysis, we conclude that the causative agent of HNEG is closely related to but clearly distinct from other polyomaviruses; we thus have named this newly identified virus Goose hemorrhagic polyomavirus.

A total of 90 blood samples were collected from wild boars in the Kyushu region of Japan, and a seroepidemiological survey for 7 arthropod-borne viruses was performed using hemagglutination inhibition tests. The individual seropositive rates for each virus were 52.2% for Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), 47.8% for Getah virus (GETV), 13.3% for Akabane virus, 10.0% for Aino virus and less than 5% for Bluetongue virus, Chuzan virus and Ibaraki virus. The results indicated that among the 7 viruses, JEV and GETV infections were prevalent among the wild boars and that the animals were involved in the natural transmission cycle of JEV and GETV in Japan. It is necessary to consider the participation of wild animals for the control of arthropod-borne virus infections.

Toxoplasma gondii is a zoonotic protozoan parasite that infects a wide range of warm-blooded animals throughout the world. In the present study, antibodies to T. gondii were determined using a commercial indirect hemagglutination (IHA) test in wild animals in a zoo. Three of 11 giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) (27%), 1 of 5 wolves (Canis lupus laniger) (20%), 1 of 6 hippopotamuses (Hippopotamus amphibious) (17%), and 2 of 9 tundra swans (Cygnus columbianus) (22%) were found to be positive. No antibodies were detected in leopards (Panthera pardus), wild geese (Anser cygnoides), and Eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus). Domestic species from 13 counties of Jiangxi Province, China were also investigated by an indirect hemagglutination (IHA) test. Thirty-five of 340 goats (10%), 94 of 560 water buffaloes (17%), and 4 of 35 cattle (11%) were found to be seropositive. This is the first report of T. gondii infection in animals kept in zoos and domestic animals in this province.

The goal of the present study was to examine the effects of forskolin (FOR), histamine (HA), L-noradrenaline (NA), isoprenaline (ISO) and dopamine (DA) on cyclic AMP formation in whole pineal glands and cerebral cortical slices of cock, duck and goose. HA (100 muM) and FOR (10 muM) potently increased cyclic AMP production in the pineal glands of all studied avian species, showing a synergistic interaction when applied together. HA at the dose of 1 mM significantly stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in the membrane preparations of cock pineal glands while lower concentrations were ineffective. HA markedly enhanced cyclic AMP formation in cerebral cortex of cock (an effect being potentiated for FOR), but did not affect the nucleotide production in this brain structure of duck and goose. DA (100 muM) had no effect, NA (100 muM) only moderately (5-22% increased, where ISO (10muM) significantly (by 50-90%) enhanced cyclic AM_ synthesis in avian cerebral cortex. Propranolol (1 muM) antagonized all these effects, while preincubation with yohimbine and prazosin significantly enhanced NA action in cortical slices of duck and goose.

The studies were carried out in two geese farms with a total number of 11.143 - 4 weeks old birds. Two imidazol preparations--5 per cent Miconazole powder and 2 Clotrimazole solution were used in these studies. Miconazole was applied as feed additive for 200 with aspergillosis infected geese, in a dosis of 10 mg of active substance on one kg of body weight. Clotrimazole was administered in a form of inhalation in a dose of 1,5 1 of 2 per cent solution per geese house of 3000 m3. Spraying was performed using gas-pipes of steam ganerator joined to the air compressor of the type 3 JW - 60 (6hp). In this way 5 - 10 microm partiches were obtained. The preparation was sprayed twice ad 2 - 4 days intervals. After Miconazole administration the recovery of sick birds and inhibition of the disease in geese were observed. The Clotrimazole preparations may be also administered prophylactically in geese houses, were stationary aspergillosis has been observed.

The complete sequence of a reovirus, strain 815-12 associated with necrotic focus formation in the liver and spleen of Muscovy ducklings in China, was determined and compared with sequences of other duck-, goose-, and chicken-origin reoviruses. The 815-12 genome comprised 22,969 bp with 10 dsRNA segments ranging from 1125 bp (S4) to 3958 bp (L1), all of which (except S4) were almost identical in length to the cognate segments of other waterfowl and chicken isolates. Detailed analyses revealed that 815-12 and other waterfowl isolates contained the conserved 3'-terminal pentanucleotide sequence (UCAUC-3') of the orthoreoviruses and 5'-terminal hexanucleotide sequence (5'-GCUUUU) of avian orthoreoviruses (ARVs), and conserved functional motifs previously identified in ARV proteins. Several notable differences, including organization of the polycistronic genome segments and genomic coding assignments of the S segments, existed between viruses represented by 815-12 and the waterfowl reoviruses emerging in China in recent years; the latter was somewhat similar to chicken isolates. Pairwise sequence comparisons demonstrated extensive sequence diversity among the various waterfowl isolates and between waterfowl and chicken isolates. Phylogenetic analyses identified two genetic groups for waterfowl reoviruses, and potential genetic reassortment of segment M2 between waterfowl and chicken reoviruses and segments encoding for λA, λB, μA, μNS and σA between waterfowl reoviruses. Taken together, it was suggested that common designation ARV-Wa should be used to represent ARV isolates from different waterfowl species and that the two ARV-Wa genotypes should be considered as two separate groups distinct from chicken isolates within the species Avian orthoreovirus.

Studied was the species-specific tolerance and the subchronic toxicity of the arprinocid coccidiostatic (9-/2-chloro-6-fluorophenylmethyl/9H-pirineamine) in the form of a 12% premix with trade mark Arpocox, Merk Sharp and Dohme Research Laboratories. It was found that at single oral application arprinocid led to the intoxication of broiler birds at 50 mg/kg, turkey poults-at up to 18 mg/kg, ducklings--up to 18 mg/kg, goslings--up to 6 mg/kg, calves--up to 10 mg/kg, lambs--up to 60 mg/kg, pigs--up to 30 mg/kg. The lethal dose for chickens was over 100 mg/kg, turkeys and duckling--30 mg/kg, and goslings--18 mg/kg. Arprinocid given with the feed to chicken broilers in conc. 60 ppm for 30 days did not lead to side effects. In conc. of 120 and especially 180 ppm there was retardation of growth with birds and inhibition of hemopoiesis. With pigs the preparation in conc. 60 to 180 ppm given with the feed had no effect on the growth and consumption of feeds; in 120 ppm and especially in 180 ppm it inhibited the hemo- and erythropoiesis. With chickens and pigs arprinocid in 180 ppm did not cause degenerative and inflammatory changes in the liver, kidneys, heart, spleen, testes, ovaria, adrenals, thyroid, and skeletal muscles.

In the present study, monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against NS1 protein of Goose parvovirus (GPV) were generated. The secreted MAbs were obtained by fusing mouse myeloma cells and spleen cells of BALB/c mice, which were immunized with the plasmid pcDNA3.1-GPV-NS1 and recombinant protein of GPV-NS1. With indirect ELISA, six hybridoma cell lines against GPV-NS1 were screened. The subtypes of the two MAbs were IgG2a; the others were IgM. The light chain was κ. Western blot analysis showed that six MAbs reacted with recombinant protein GPV-NS1. GPV-NS1 was dissected into 15 overlapping epitopes, which were used to react with MAbs in Western blot. Results showed that six MAbs recognized NS1 protein linear B-cell epitopes located at the C-terminus 453-514 aa, 485-542 aa, and 533-598 aa.

The main of this study is to give evidence about the spread of streptothricin resistance within Campylobacters which were isolated from animals, men and environmental sources. Streptothricin resistant Campylobacters were isolated over a five years period, when the use of streptothricin for ergotropic purposes was not allowed, from slurry of swine, slurry of cattle, waste water of a goose farm and waste water of a communal sewage treatment plant. The streptothricin resistance was found to be connected with resistances to kanamycin and streptomycin (MIC > 1024 micrograms/ml). For DNA-DNA-hybridisation we used a gene probe derived from the streptothricin acetyltransferase determinant sat4 from Campylobacter coli to find out epidemiological associations between Campylobacters of different origin. The hybridisation experiments show that all streptothricin resistant strains, which were isolated from one ecosystem or where an epidemiological link seems given, have sat4 positive signals at identical positions of the digested and blotted chromosomal DNA. The detection of the sat4 gene seems to be a good tool to discriminate clonal diversities within multiple antibiotic resistant Campylobacters.

The Tembusu virus (TMUV) is an avian pathogenic flavivirus that causes a highly contagious disease and catastrophic losses to the poultry industry. The myxovirus resistance protein (Mx) of innate immune effectors is a key antiviral &ldquo;workhorse” of the interferon (IFN) system. Although mammalian Mx resistance against myxovirus and retrovirus was witnessed for decades, whether or not bird Mx has anti-flavivirus activity remains unknown. In this study, we found that the transcription of goose Mx (goMx) was obviously driven by TMUV infection, both in vivo and in vitro, and that the titers and copies of TMUV were significantly reduced by goMx overexpression. In both primary (goose embryo fibroblasts, GEFs) and passaged cells (baby hamster kidney cells, BHK21, and human fetal kidney cells, HEK 293T), it was shown that goMx was mainly located in the cytoplasm, and sporadically distributed in the nucleus. The intracellular localization of this protein is attributed to the predicted bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS; 30 residues: the 441st–471st amino acids of goMx). Intuitively, it seems that the cells with a higher level of goMx expression tend to have lower TMUV loads in the cytoplasm, as determined by an immunofluorescence assay. To further explore the antiviral determinants, a panel of variants was constructed. Two amino acids at the 125th (Lys) and 145th (Thr) positions in GTP-binding elements, not in the L4 loop (40 residues: the 532nd–572nd amino acids of goMx), were vital for the antiviral function of goMx against TMUV in vitro. These findings will contribute to our understanding of the functional significance of the antiviral system in aquatic birds, and the development of goMx could be a valuable therapeutic agent against TMUV.

A cell-transfer system was employed in the present work to investigate several characteristics of the capacity of immune and normal lymphoid cells to transfer the delayed response to methylated human serum albumin in lethally irradiated syngeneic recipients. Spleen cells derived from donor mice immunized with goose erythrocytes were far less effective in transferring responsiveness when compared with equal numbers of normal cells. Statistical analyses indicated a frequency of 1 reactive cell or cell unit in 1.3 x 10(7) normal cells and in 6.2 x 10(7) immune cells. These findings provided confirmatory evidence that antigen-induced suppression (antigenic competition) employing sequential administration of two non-cross-reacting antigens is due to relative deficits of immunocompetent cells generated by lymphoproliferation in lymphoid tissues secondary to immunization with the initial antigen. The cellular deficit in the immune population was shown to be resident in a thymus cell population, which restored the number of responders to a level equivalent to the normal population. The thymic cell was akin to the antigen-reactive cell. The cell limiting the degree of response, that is the effector cell for both normal and immune cell populations, was of bone marrow origin. Both populations of cells were shown to act in synergy to reconstitute the delayed response to the antigen.

To determine the distribution and localization of new type gosling viral enteritis virus (NGVEV) in paraformaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of experimentally infected goslings, for the first time, an immunohistochemical (IHC) staining method was reported. Anti-NGVEV polyclonal serum was obtained from the rabbits immunized with purified NGVEV antigen, which was extracted by caprylic-ammonium sulphate method and purified through High-Q columns anion exchange chromatography. Three-day-old NGVEV-free goslings were orally inoculated with NGVEV-CN strain suspension as infection group and phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) as control group, respectively. The tissues were collected at sequential time points between 0.5 and 720h post inoculation (PI), and prepared for IHC staining and ultra-structural observation. The positive immunoreactivity could be readily detected in the lymphoid and gastrointestinal organs of infected goslings as early as 48 h PI, in the liver, kidney, pancreas and myocardium from 72 h, and in the cerebrum and cerebellum from 96 h, while it was hardly detected in the respiratory organs at any time. The positive staining reaction could be detected in NGVEV-infected goslings until 600 h PI, and no positive staining cell could be observed in the controls. The highest levels of viral antigen were found in the bursa of Fabricius (BF), thymus, proventriculus, gizzard and intestine tract, moreover, the liver, kidney, spleen, myocardium and pancreas were intensively and widely stained. The target cells had a ubiquitous distribution, especially included the epithelial cells, endothelial cells, superficial and crypt mucosal cells, glandular cells, fibrocytes, macrophages and lymphocytes, which served as the principal sites for antigen localization. The ultra-structural observation by transmission electron microscope (TEM) further indicated that NGVEV particles could be widely detected in the lymphoid and digestive organs of infected goslings from 72 h PI onwards. This work may be useful not only for offering a possibility of routine diagnosis of NGVE, but also for better understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease.

196 geese, 141 ducks, and 100 hens from 9 localities of the South Moravian region (District of Breclav) were examined by means of the haemagglutination-inhibition test (HIT) for the presence of antibodies against 12 arbovirus antigens of the groups Alfavirus (Western Equine Encephalitis (WEE), Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE), Semliki, Sindbis, Chikungunya, O'nyong-nyong), Flavovirus (Tick-borne Encephalitis (TBE), Dengue and West Nile Virus (WN), Bunyamwera Supergroup (Tahna and Beta Calovo), and the Yaba 1-Lednice 110 Virus. In tested fowls antibodies were mostly found against Yaba 1-Lednice 110 Virus, namely 3.6% in geese and 17.7% in ducks. Antibodies against Calovo Virus were found in only 1 of the tested ducks. All sera of hens were negative. Antibodies against arboviruses of the Alfa-and Flavovirus groups were not detected.

Eighty-three strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) were obtained from outbreaks in chickens, pigeons, geese, and ducks in China in 2005 and characterized genotypically. The main functional region of the F gene (535 nucleotides) was amplified and sequenced. A phylogenetic tree based on nucleotides 47-435 of the F gene was created using sequences from 83 isolates and representative NDV sequences obtained from GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all newly characterized strains belonged to six genetic groups: I, II, III, VIb, VIIc, and VIId. All the isolates belonging to groups I and II (14 total) were lentogenic according to the amino acid sequences of the fusion protein cleavage site, and either V4 or LaSota-type, depending on the vaccines that were used. Most isolates (64 total) were classified in group VIId, a predominant genotype responsible for most Newcastle disease outbreaks since the end of the last century. One strain, NDV05-055, was in group VIIc, three pigeon strains were in group VIb, and one isolate, NDV05-041, was in group III, and characterized as a velogenic strain. This study revealed that genotype VIId was the major NDV strain responsible for the 2005 ND epizoonosis that occurred in China.

Seventy-six type A influenza viruses recovered from waterfowl in Wisconsin, California, South Dakota, Florida, Texas, Alabama, and Nebraska were tested for virulence in chickens. The challenge to chickens was intravenous inoculation of first-, second-, or third-egg-passage virus. Each of the virus strains was tested separately in three or four chickens. Eighteen of the 76 viruses caused the death of one or more chickens following inoculation. Postmortem lesions were similar in all dead birds. In decreasing order of frequency, gross lesions included: swollen kidneys evident as accentuated lobular patterns, urates in the pericardial sac, and urates on the surface of the liver. Microscopic lesions present in kidneys were consistent with visceral gout. Mortality was associated with inoculations having higher concentrations of infectious virus. These results indicate that the influenza A viruses circulating in duck populations may include strains potentially pathogenic for chickens.

Genetic analysis of all eight genes of two Nanchang avian influenza viruses, A/Duck/Nanchang/1681/92 (H3N8-1681) and A/Duck/Nanchang/1904/92 (H7N1-1904), isolated from Jiangxi province, China, in 1992, showed that six internal genes of H3N8-1681 virus and five internal (except NS gene) genes of H7N1-1904 virus were closely similar to A/Goose/Guangdong/1/96 (H5N1) virus, the first highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus of subtype H5N1 isolated in Asia. The neuraminidase (NA) gene of Gs/Gd/1/96 had the highest genetic similarity with A/Duck/Hokkaido/55/96 (H1N1-55) virus. The haemagglutinin (HA) gene of Gs/Gd/1/96 virus might have originated as a result of mutation of H5 HA gene from A/Swan/Hokkaido/51/96 (H5N3-51)-like viruses. The PA gene of H5N3-51 virus had the highest similarity with Gs/Gd/1/96. This study explains the origin of first Asian HPAI H5N1 virus in Guangdong by the reassortment of Nanchang (close to Guangdong) and Hokkaido (Japan) (H1N1-55 and H5N3-51) viruses. Genetic characteristics of donor and recipient viruses were also studied.

The feeding of a shipment of imported corn was associated with a severe reduction in growth and increased mortality in geese, and increased mortality in broilers. Pathological examinations revealed hepatopathy, visceral gout and mild nephropathy in geese, and in broilers an hepatopathy, which was often severe, and ascites. Samples of feed from affected geese farms were examined for up to 24 mycotoxins, and ochratoxin was found in 6 of 15 samples at levels up to 930 ng/g. The syndrome was experimentally reproduced by feeding geese and broilers suspect feeds with the natural ochratoxin contamination. It is believed that another, unidentified, mycotoxin was the major cause of the hepatotoxicity, and that ochratoxin served in this case as an indicator of a multi-mycotoxin involvement.

Domestic ducks, geese, pigeons, quail, and chickens were given colored, flavored, or colored and flavored food and then injected with lithium chloride. Each species showed learning of color and taste aversions. Flavor facilitated the formation of color aversions in ducks, geese, and pigeons but not in quail or chickens. Color interfered with the formation of flavor aversions in quail and chickens but not in the other three species. These findings indicate that all birds can probably associate both colored and flavored food with induced sickness and that colored food is more easily associated with induced sickness than is colored water. Moreover, these findings suggest that the capacity to associate colored and flavored food with induced sickness and the interaction between color and flavor in food vary between species. Birds, such as quail and chickens, that eat relatively tasteless food rely more on color than on flavor cues when forming learned food aversions. Birds that can select their food on the basis of taste, such as ducks and geese, rely more on flavor than on color when forming aversions to food. Birds, such as pigeons, that are initially raised on tasty food before switching to predominantly tasteless food show tendencies that are similar to those of ducks and geese.

The effects of insulin deficiency on pancreatic A cell responsiveness to glucose was studied in subtotally depancreatized geese. In geese operated for 3 to 5 days and receiving insulin therapy (I.M.: 0.5-1.0 U/kg/24 h), A cell response to glucose (I.V. injection: 0.5 g/kg) was abolished, but could be restored to normal range by insulin (I.V. injection: 0.025-0.2 U/kg) together with glucose. After 5 weeks of therapy, A cell sensitivity declined: the physiological amount of insulin (0.025 U/kg) was insufficient to suppress glucagon during the glucose load, whereas the large dose (0.2 U/kg) partially restored A cell response. In addition, daily insulin treatment prevented a severe increase of fasting plasma glucose and glucagon. Geese receiving no insulin therapy showed "total blindness" to glucose, even when given insulin at the time of the test. These data suggest a progressive loss of sensitivity of the A cell to insulin. Endocrine and/or panacrine insulin deficiency may play a role on the dysfuncion of the glucose-glucagon feedback mechanism.

Naturally occurring lymphoreticular tumors in geese have been found from time to time in Taiwan, but their etiology has not been determined except through morphological descriptions. This study observed a reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) infection occurring in a white Roman goose (Anser anser) farm in Yunlin, Taiwan in 2006. These geese showed growth-retarded and nodular lymphoma-like tumors in the liver, lung, kidney, and pancreas. Thirty blood samples were taken for REV detection and 21 (70%) of them contained REV genetic sequences using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Virus isolation was attempted from 11 blood samples by inoculating the buffy coat onto DF1 cells. Nine (81%) REVs were isolated after three blind passages. The complete proviral sequence from one isolate was determined for phylogenetic analysis by direct sequencing using overlapping PCR products. The length of the provial genome is 8284 nucleotides. By comparing with other published REV complete sequences, the nucleotide percent identity ranged from 93.5% to 99.8% with most LTR varieties, ranging from 74.9% to 99.8%. The present isolated goose REV is most close to REV APC-566, a REV isolated from Attwater's Prairie chickens.

To generate a genotype VII Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vaccine with high yield in embryonated chicken eggs, we selected genotype VII NDV strain JS5/05, which possesses a high virus titer in embryos as the parental virus. Using reverse genetics, we generated a genetically tagged derivative (NDV/AI4) of JS5/05 by changing the amino acid sequence of the cleavage site of the F0 protein. Pathogenicity tests showed that NDV/AI4 was completely avirulent. NDV/AI4 was genetically stable and replicated efficiently during 10 consecutive passages in embryos. More importantly, serologic assays showed that oil-emulsion NDV/AI4 induced higher hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers against the prevalent virus than oil-emulsion LaSota vaccine in chickens and geese. Moreover, NDV/AI4-induced HI titers rose faster than those elicited by LaSota in chickens. Both NDV/AI4 and LaSota provided protection against clinical disease and mortality after the challenge with the genotype VII NDV strain JS3/05. However, NDV/AI4 significantly reduced virus shedding from the vaccinated birds compared to LaSota. Taken together, these results suggest that NDV/AI4 can provide better protection than LaSota and is a promising vaccine candidate against genotype VII NDV.

Susceptibility of Canada geese (Branta canadensis) to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus (H5N1) infection was studied by inoculating 10 naïve (antibody-negative) animals (5 adults and 5 juveniles) with A/chicken/Vietnam/14/05 (H5N1) virus. In the adults, 1 of 5 became infected, and 4 of 5 remained normal; in the juvenile group, 5 of 5 became infected. The pathology observed in the affected animals was similar to that reported in natural occurrences. Peripheral and parasympathetic nervous systems were examined and found infected, as well as cerebrospinal fluid-contacting neurons. In some locations with significant virus infection in cells, the expected inflammatory reaction was absent or very mild. Immunohistochemistry was used to locate influenza A virus nucleoprotein in brain, spinal cord, respiratory and digestive systems, pancreas, heart, and peripheral and parasympathetic nervous systems. Further studies are needed to explain age-related differences in susceptibility.

The H5N1 type A influenza viruses that emerged in Hong Kong in 1997 are a unique lineage of type A influenza viruses with the capacity to transmit directly from chickens to humans and produce significant disease and mortality in both of these hosts. The objective of this study was to ascertain the susceptibility of emus (Dramaius novaehollandiae), domestic geese (Anser anser domesticus), domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos), and pigeons (Columba livia) to intranasal (i.n.) inoculation with the A/chicken/Hong Kong/220/97 (H5N1) highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. No mortality occurred within 10 days postinoculation (DPI) in the four species investigated, and clinical disease, evident as neurologic dysfunction, was observed exclusively in emus and geese. Grossly, pancreatic mottling and splenomegaly were identified in these two species. In addition, the geese had cerebral malacia and thymic and bursal atrophy. Histologically, both the emus and geese developed pancreatitis, meningoencephalitis, and mild myocarditis. Influenza viral antigen was demonstrated in areas with histologic lesions up to 10 DPI in the geese. Virus was reisolated from oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs and from the lung, brain, and kidney of the emus and geese. Moderate splenomegaly was observed grossly in the ducks. Viral infection of the ducks was pneumotropic, as evidenced by mild inflammatory lesions in the respiratory tract and virus reisolation from oropharyngeal swabs and from a lung. Pigeons were resistant to HK/220 infection, lacking gross and histologic lesions, viral antigen, and reisolation of virus. These results imply that emus and geese are susceptible to i.n. inoculation with the HK/220 virus, whereas ducks and pigeons are more resistant. These latter two species probably played a minimal epidemiologic role in the perpetuation of the H5N1 Hong Kong-origin influenza viruses.

Enhancing cellulose digestibility in animals is important for improving the utilization of forage, which can decrease the amount of food used in animal production. The aim of the present study was to achieve recombinant expression of the cellulase gene in Lactococcus lactis and evaluate the effects of oral administration of the recombinant L. lactis on fiber digestibility in geese. Cellulase (Cell) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) genes were cloned into a L. lactis expression vector (pNZ8149) to construct the recombinant expression plasmid (pNZ8149-GFP-Cell). Then, the recombinant expression plasmid was transformed into L. lactis (NZ3900) competent cells by electroporation to obtain recombinant L. lactis (pNZ8149-GFP-Cell/NZ3900) in which protein expression was induced by Nisin. Expression of GFP and Cell by the recombinant L. lactis was confirmed using SDS-PAGE, fluorescence detection, and Congo red assays. A feeding experiment showed that oral administration of pNZ8149-GFP-Cell/NZ3900 significantly increased the digestibility of dietary fiber in geese fed either a maize stalk diet or a rice chaff diet. Therefore, oral administration of recombinant L. lactis cells expressing the cellulase gene increases fiber digestibility in geese, offering a way to increase the utilization of dietary fiber in geese.

Flaviviruses pose a significant threat to public health worldwide. Recently, a novel flavivirus, duck Tembusu virus (TMUV), was identified as the causative agent of a serious duck viral disease in Asia. Its rapid spread and expanded host range have raised substantial concerns regarding its potential threat to non-avian hosts, including humans. However, the specific molecular host responses to this virus are poorly understood. In this study, we used the RNA-sequencing technique to analyse the differential gene expression in the spleens of infected goslings 5days post-infection. In total, 2878 upregulated unigenes and 2943 downregulated unigenes were identified. The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses revealed that different pattern recognition receptor (PRR) signalling pathways simultaneously participated in the sensing of the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of TMUV, and the antigen presentation pathway and acquired immunity were activated. Then, the signals were transduced by the NF-kappa B (NF-κB) or the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathways, resulting in the enormous production of various cytokines and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). We further investigated the immune response patterns in the liver and brain tissue using RT-qPCR. The bacterial peptidoglycan sensor nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 1 (NOD1) receptor was significantly upregulated, especially in the brain tissue, suggesting that NOD1 likely induces an inflammatory response by interacting with dsRNA, which is similar to its actions during hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection. However, major histocompatibility complex II (MHCII) was downregulated only in the spleen, indicating that the downregulation of MHCII in the spleen may be an immune evasion strategy of TMUV to facilitate pathogenesis during infection. Here, we are the first to report a transcriptome analysis of the host immune response to TMUV infection, and the data reported herein may help elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the gosling-TMUV interaction.

Synthesis and enzymatic modification of histone V was 1 order of magnitude lower in mature gander erythrocytes as compared with immature enriched cells hwich were capable of DNA synthesis. Application of shallow, linear gradient chromatography was used to demonstrate qualitative changes as well. This technique permitted the separation of newly synthesized and phosphorylated histone V from older, less phosphorylated molecules but did not discriminate between acetylated species. The most easily eluted fractions were those most recently synthesized, acetylated, and phosphorylated. While lysine chased into the other subfractions of histone V, phosphate did not, indicating a dephosphorylation step in the immature cells. Acetylation of histone V which occurs at a very low level was closely related to its synthesis. No differences in molecular weights or amino acid compositions were apparent, and behavior on polyacrylamide gels was similar to whole histone V. It is proposed that phosphorylation of histone V may play an important role in the modulation of the effect of histone V in immature cells on condensation and template restriction of chromatin which occurs in the terminal stages of differentiation of the avian erythroid cells.

The pathology, epizootiology and aetiology of a specific disease of young geese, which has been seen in Hungary for more than three decades, were investigated. The disease was characterised by splenitis and hepatitis with miliary necrotic foci during the acute phase, and epicarditis, arthritis and tenosynovitis during the subacute/chronic phase. Clinical signs usually appeared at 2 to 3 weeks of age and persisted for 3 to 6 weeks. From different organs of the affected birds, a reovirus was isolated in embryonated eggs and tissue cultures of Muscovy duck or goose origin, as well as in Vero cells. In experimental infections, the dominant features of the disease were reproduced in day-old and young goslings. The biological and partial molecular characterisation of one of the isolated strains (D15/99) showed that it was related to the reovirus described as the cause of a similar disease of Muscovy ducks. An RT-PCR method suitable for the detection of reoviruses was also elaborated and tested. This is the first report on the involvement of reovirus in arthritis of geese.

The effect of low dose T-2 toxin was investigated in chicken, duck and goose. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of T-2 toxin on the lipid peroxidation and on the activity of glutathione redox system (amount of reduced and oxidised glutathione and the activity of glutathione peroxidase) in blood and liver. The treatment lasted days and two samples were taken, first at the time of lowest feed intake and second when the intake was the same as the control. It was found, that lipid per oxidation as detected by the amount of malondialdehyde increased in all of the species and tissues but the changes varied by species. The most sensitive species was goose followed by duck and chicken, and the most sensitive tissue was the liver followed by blood plasma and red blood cells.

We have cloned and sequenced the cDNA encoding the chicken fatty acid synthase. Based on the nucleotide-derived amino acid sequence of the chicken synthase, the N-terminal sequences are highly conserved among animal species, suggesting that translation of the animal synthases initiates with the same ATG codon. Like other fatty acid synthases, the NH2-terminal sequence of the chicken enzyme is blocked. We have isolated and purified the blocked NH2-terminal peptide from a tryptic digest of chicken synthase and have established that the blocking group is an acetyl group. The sequence of the native tryptic peptide confirmed the cDNA-derived amino acid sequence and suggested that all animal synthases begin with this homologous sequence. We developed simple procedures that can be used to isolate and characterize any blocked NH2-terminal peptide.

Taxon 1502 was originally described as a Riemerella anatipestifer-like bacterium causing exudative septicaemia in ducks and geese. In the present study, an integrated genotypic and phenotypic approach was used to elucidate the phylogenetic affiliation and taxonomic relationships of 12 strains of taxon 1502. Whole-cell protein and fatty acid analyses and an extensive biochemical examination by using conventional tests and several API microtest systems indicated that all isolates formed a homogeneous taxon, which was confirmed by DNA-DNA hybridizations. 16S rDNA sequence analysis of a representative strain (LMG 14382T) indicated that this taxon belongs to the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides phylum and revealed a moderate but distinct relationship to species of the genus Capnocytophaga (overall 16S rDNA sequence identities were 88.8-90.2%). Taxon 1502 is concluded to represent a single species that should be allocated to a novel genus, and the name Coenonia anatina gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The DNA G + C content of representative strains was 35-36 mol% and the type strain is LMG 14382T.

West Nile virus (WNV) is an emergent pathogen in the Americas, first reported in New York during 1999, and has since spread across the USA, Central and South America causing neurological disease in humans, horses and some bird species, including domestic geese. No WNV vaccines are licensed in the USA for use in geese. This study reports the development of a domestic goose vaccine efficacy model, based on utilizing multiple parameters to determine protection. To test the model, 47 geese were divided in two experiments, testing five different vaccine groups and two sham groups (challenged and unchallenged). Based on the broad range of results for individual metrics between the Challenged-Sham and Unchallenged-Sham groups, the best parameters to measure protection were Clinical Pathogenicity Index (CPI), plasma virus positive geese on days 1-4 post-inoculation and plasma virus titers, and brain histological lesion rates and severity scores. Compared to the Challenged-Sham group, the fowlpox virus vectored vaccine with inserts of WNV prM and E proteins (vFP2000) provided the best protection with significant differences in all five metrics, followed by the canarypox virus vectored vaccine with inserts of WNV prM and E proteins (vCP2018) with four metrics of protection, recombinant vCP2017 with three metrics and WNV E protein with one. These data indicate that domestic geese can be used in an efficacy model for vaccine protection studies using clinical, plasma virological and brain histopathological parameters to evaluate protection against WNV challenge.

Equine arteritis virus (EAV) grown on RK13 cell cultures was tested for hemagglutination (HA) with erythrocytes from a variety of species at 4 degrees C, room temperature and 37 degrees C. HA was observed at all temperatures with erythrocytes from mouse and chicken but not with those of cattle, horse, rabbit, guinea pig, mongolian gerbil, goose or chick embryo. Chickens showed an individual variation in agglutinability of their erythrocytes, requiring selection of birds to obtain erythrocytes for HA. The HA activity was enhanced by treatment of virus materials with Tween 80 followed by treatment with ether. The HA reaction was inhibited by specific antiserum. Higher HA-inhibiting (HI) antibody titers were obtained by the incubation of serum-HA antigen mixture at 4 degrees C for 24 hr. HI antibody titers of individual horse sera showed a significant positive correlation with their neutralizing antibody titers.

The present study was conducted to investigate spermatozoal membrane integrity, acrosome integrity, mitochondrial activity, and chromatin structure in fresh and frozen-thawed Canada goose (Branta canadensis) semen with the use of the flow cytometry. The experiment was carried out on ten, 2-year-old, Canada goose ganders. The semen was collected twice a week, by a dorso-abdominal massage method, then pooled and subjected to cryopreservation in straws, in a programmable freezing unit with the use of dimethyloformamide (DMF) as a cryoprotectant. Frozen samples were thawed in a water bath at 60 °C. The freezing procedure was performed ten times. For the cytometric analysis the fresh and the frozen-thawed semen was extended with EK extender to a final concentration of 50 million spermatozoa per mL. Sperm membrane integrity was assessed with SYBR-14 and propidium iodide (PI), acrosomal damage was evaluated with the use of PNA-Alexa Fluor®488 conjugate, mitochondrial activity was estimated with Rhodamine 123 (R123), and spermatozoal DNA integrity was measured by the sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA). The cryopreservation of Canada goose semen significantly decreased the percentage of live cells, from 76.3 to 50.4% (P < 0.01). Moreover, we observed the significant decrease in the percentage of live spermatozoa with intact acrosomes (P < 0.01), but we did not detect significant changes in the percentage of live spermatozoa with ruptured acrosomes. However, after thawing 50% of Canada goose live spermatozoa retained intact acrosomes. Furthermore, the percentage of live spermatozoa with active mitochondria was significantly lower in the frozen-thawed semen than in the fresh semen (P < 0.05). Nevertheless, after thawing the mitochondria remained active in almost 50% of live cells. In the present study, we observed no changes in the percentage of sperm with fragmented DNA after freezing-thawing of Canada goose semen. In conclusion, the present study indicates that even the fresh Branta canadensis semen might have poor quality, the cryopreservation of its semen did not provoke spermatozoal DNA defragmentation and half of the spermatozoa retained intact acrosomes and active mitochondria after freezing-thawing.

The technique of reversible hemolysis represents one approach which may be used to study transport regulation in nucleated red cells. After 1 h of incubation at 37 degrees C, 88% of the ghosts regained their permeability barrier to L-glucose. In these ghosts, the carrier-mediated rate of entry of 3-O-methylglucose was more than 10-fold greater than the rate in intact cells. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase prevented ghosts from resealing when it was present at the time of hemolysis. Albumin, lactic dehydrogenase and peroxidase did not have this effect. Sugar transport rate could not be tested in the unsealed ghosts. Two possible mechanisms for the effect of hypotonic hemolysis on sugar transport rate were discussed: (1) altered membrane organization and (2) loss of intracellular compounds which bind to the membrane and inhibit transport in intact cells.

Satietin, a 50,000 dalton anorectic glycoprotein was isolated from human serum. Its isoelectric point is 7.0. It contains 14-15% amino acids and 70-75% carbohydrates. Its biological activity survives digestion with proteases and boiling. Satietin is a highly potent anorectic substance. The intracerebroventricular administration of 10-20 micrograms satietin suppresses food intake in rats during the first day of feeding after deprivation of food for 96 hours to half of the amount eaten by untreated controls (ID50). The onset of the effect can be detected within 30 minutes, the peak effect is reached within an hour. The effect lasts 24-30 hours. Satietin acts both at intravenous and subcutaneous administration (ID50 = 0.5-0.75 mg/kg) in rats deprived of food for 96 hours. The peak effect is reached within an hour and lasts over 24 hours. In contrast to the anorectic drugs in clinical use and to the endogenous anorectic substances (like cholecystokinin and calcitonin) satietin proved to be highly selective in suppressing food intake. Considering that satietin is widely distributed in the world of vertebrates, its concentration in the blood is amazingly high, its site of effect is in the central nervous system and it induces satiety without having any other detectable central or peripheral effect, the hypothesis was forwarded that satietin may play the role of a rate limiting blood-borne satiety signal in the negative feedback of food intake, i.e. serving as the essential chemical link connecting the gastrointestinal tract and the brain in the regulation of feeding.

This study investigated the in vitro efficacy of mequindox against enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), and characterized the oqxAB genes as the main mequindox resistance determinant in E. coli strains of animal origin. A total of 1123 E. coli isolates were collected from domestic animals in China from the 1970s to 2013, and mequindox susceptibility was tested by broth microdilution. The percentage of E. coli isolates with increased mequindox MICs of ≥ 64 μg/ml showed a rising trend each year throughout the study period. Mequindox showed good bactericidal activity in vitro towards 20 EPEC strains, although it had a wide mutant selection window. All 1123 E. coli isolates were tested for the presence of the oqxAB genes, and the operon was detected in 322 isolates, which accounted for 94.4% (322/341) of isolates with increased MICs to mequindox (MIC ≥ 64 μg/ml). Of the isolates with mequindox MIC ≤ 32 μg/ml, 98.8% (773/782) were oqxAB negative. Polymerase chain reaction-based stability testing revealed that the IS26-oqxAB circular intermediate was present in 93.4% (309/331) of the oqxAB-positive strains, indicating that this IS26-flanked Tn6010 element was unstable and prone to excision via IS26-mediated recombination. Functional analysis of the oqxAB genes confirmed that this operon alone is sufficient to confer resistance or increased MICs to multiple antimicrobials, including mequindox. This is the first study to investigate the relationship between mequindox susceptibility and oqxAB genotype, and may provide the basis for establishing the resistance breakpoint for mequindox against E. coli.

Understanding the molecular dynamics of viral spreading is crucial for anticipating the epidemiological implications of disease outbreaks. In the case of influenza, reassortments or point mutations affect the adaption to new hosts or resistance to anti-viral drugs and can determine whether a new strain will result in a pandemic infection or a less severe progression. To this end, tools integrating molecular information with epidemiological parameters are important to understand how molecular characteristics reflect in the infection dynamics. We present a new web tool, MapMyFlu, which allows to spatially and temporally display influenza viruses related to a query sequence on a Google Map based on BLAST results against the NCBI Influenza Database. Temporal and geographical trends appear clearly and may help in reconstructing the evolutionary history of a particular sequence. The tool is accessible through a web server, hence without the need for local installation. The website has an intuitive design and provides an easy-to-use service, and is available at http://mapmyflu.ipmb.uni-heidelberg.de.

In mammals, insulin resistance (IR) is required for the occurrence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) contributes to IR. As geese have physiological and metabolic characteristics different from mammals, it is unclear whether these mechanisms also underlie the occurrence of goose fatty liver. To address this, 70-day-old geese were treated with an ERS inducer or overfed, and variables associated with ERS or IR were subsequently determined. The data indicated that the group of geese treated with the ERS inducer for 20d appeared to be more intolerant to blood glucose than the control group, and their livers showed features of hepatic steatosis, suggesting ERS can induce IR and hepatic steatosis in geese. In contrast, overfeeding did not induce ERS, probably due to the upregulated expression of fatty acid desaturases, but induced higher fasting/postprandial blood glucose as well as glucose intolerance in geese, which was accompanied by a dramatic increase of liver weight. Taken together, these findings delineated the role of ERS and IR in the occurrence of goose fatty liver.

Changes in plasma DHEA, testosterone (T) and 17-B-oestradiol (E2) levels were examined in domestic geese of both sexes in the fall and winter. The levels of steroid hormones were determined in blood plasma by means of radio-immunoassay (RIA). A so-called second (autumn) cycle was induced in geese via a dark-room preparation and natural keeping conditions. The plasma levels of DHEA showed a minor peak at onset of the autumn breeding and a major one prior to the more intense spring reproduction in both sexes. The seasonal curves of plasma DHEA appeared fairly similar in ganders and layers and without considerable differences between the absolute values. In ganders, plasma DHEA peaks preceded the elevations in T levels in the fall and spring alike. With layers, in turn, the autumn and spring peaks of plasma DHEA appeared after the peaks in E2 levels. With ganders, the concentration of plasma T seemed to predominate between the two androgens throughout the experimental period. With layers, in turn, the concentration of DHEA surpassed the level of plasma E2 at the time of the peak periods and other times during the study, as well. In domestic geese, DHEA is probably involved in the autumn physiological processes and the induction of reproduction during fall and early spring periods, alike.

Riemerella anatipestifer is the causative agent of polyserositis of ducks and geese. We have previously reported that a 3.9-kb plasmid, pCFC1, carries protein genes (vapD1 and vapD2) that are similar to virulence-associated genes of other bacteria. In the present study, we report the complete sequence of a second plasmid of 5.6 kb, pCFC2. pCFC2 has a 28% G-C content and three large open reading frames (ORFs). One of the ORFs (designated asVapD1) encodes a polypeptide that shares 53.9, 53.9, 48.3, 48.3 and 46.1% identity with virulence-associated proteins of Dichelobacter nodosus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Helicobacter pylori and Haemophilus influenzae, respectively. The second ORF encodes a putative DNA replication protein (RepA3) with 309 amino acids and a molecular mass of approximately 36 kDa. A novel insertion sequence (IS) element, designated ISRa1, was found on the plasmid pCFC2. ISRa1 was flanked by 15-bp imperfect inverted repeats (only one mismatched nucleotide). ISRa1 contained an ORF encoding a putative transposase of 292 amino acids. Southern blot analysis indicated that in R. anatipestifer strains examined, ISRa1 was present with 2-20 copies (at least). ISRa1 displayed a sequence approximately 35% homologous to the putative IS982 and RSBst-alpha from Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris SK11 and Bacillus stearothermophilus CU21. Three hybridization patterns of genomic DNA of eight R. anatipestifer strains with an ISRa1 probe indicated that ISRa1 might be a useful tool for epidemiological studies.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus of the H5N1 subtype was first diagnosed in poultry in Egypt in 2006, and since then the disease became enzootic in poultry throughout the country, affecting the poultry industry and village poultry as well as infecting humans. Vaccination has been used as a part of the control strategy to help to control the disease. Epidemiological data with sequence analysis of H5N1 viruses is important to link the mechanism of virus evolution in Egypt. This study describes the evolutionary pattern of Egyptian H5N1 viruses based on molecular characterization for the isolates collected from commercial poultry farms and village poultry from 2006 to 2011. Genetic analysis of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene was done by sequencing of the full-length H5 gene. The epidemiological pattern of disease outbreaks in Egyptian poultry farms seems to be seasonal with no specific geographic distribution across the country. The molecular epidemiological data revealed that there are two major groups of viruses: the classic group of subclade 2.2.1 and a variant group of 2.2.1.1. The classic group is prevailing mainly in village poultry and had fewer mutations compared to the originally introduced virus in 2006. Since 2009, this group has started to be transmitted back to commercial sectors. The variant group emerged by late 2007, was prevalent mainly in vaccinated commercial poultry, mutated continuously at a higher rate until 2010, and started to decline in 2011. Genetic analysis of the neuraminidase (NA) gene and the other six internal genes indicates a grouping of the Egyptian viruses similar to that obtained using the HA gene, with no obvious reassortments. The results of this study indicate that HPAI-H5N1 viruses are progressively evolving and adapting in Egypt and continue to acquire new mutations every season.

Goose hemorrhagic polyomavirus (GHPV) is the viral agent of hemorrhagic nephritis enteritis of geese (HNEG), a lethal disease of goslings. Although death is the most common outcome, geese that recover from HNEG are persistently infected. Here, we present the development of real-time SYBR Green real-time PCR targeted to GHPV and its use to assess the prevalence of GHPV infection in French geese flocks. When compared with classical end-point PCR, real-time PCR revealed a much better sensitivity and equivalent specificity. Real-time PCR could, therefore, be considered a gold standard for the detection of GHPV. Results of field investigations evidenced a very high prevalence of GHPV infections in French geese, largely associated with healthy carriage.

Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) are severe disease manifestations that can occur following sequential infection with different dengue virus serotypes (DENV1-4). At present, there are no licensed therapies to treat DENV-induced disease. DHF and DSS are thought to be mediated by serotype cross-reactive antibodies that facilitate antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) by binding to viral antigens and then Fcγ receptors (FcγR) on target myeloid cells. Using genetically engineered DENV-specific antibodies, it has been shown that the interaction between the Fc portion of serotype cross-reactive antibodies and FcγR is required to induce ADE. Additionally, it was demonstrated that these antibodies were as neutralizing as their non-modified variants, were incapable of inducing ADE, and were therapeutic following a lethal, antibody-enhanced infection. Therefore, we hypothesized that avian IgY, which do not interact with mammalian FcγR, would provide a novel therapy for DENV-induced disease. We demonstrate here that goose-derived anti-DENV2 IgY neutralized DENV2 and did not induce ADE in vitro. Anti-DENV2 IgY was also protective in vivo when administered 24 hours following a lethal DENV2 infection. We were also able to demonstrate via epitope mapping that both full-length and alternatively spliced anti-DENV2 IgY recognized different epitopes, including epitopes that have not been previously identified. These observations provide evidence for the potential therapeutic applications of goose-derived anti-DENV2 IgY.

Adaptation of the receptor-binding preference from alpha2,3- to alpha2,6-linked sialic acid is an essential step for an avian influenza virus to transmit efficiently in human population and become a pandemic virus. The currently available assays for receptor-binding preference are complex and not widely available.

Four Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strains were isolated from domestic, commercial geese that showed clinical signs that were believed to be the result of NDV infections. The genetic, antigenic, and pathogenic characteristics of the 4 NDVs were compared with those of NDV strains that were isolated from chickens. The complete genomes of 2 of the NDV strains contained 15,186 nucleotides (nt); the other 2 contained 15,192 nt, and exhibited the typical genomic organization of genotype II NDV and molecular characteristics of VIId NDVs. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the genotype II and VIId NDVs that were isolated from geese belonged to the same clusters as the corresponding genotypes of the chicken isolates. A serologic assay demonstrated that the antigenic relatedness among the NDVs was associated with their genotypes, rather than their hosts, and that amino acid substitutions in the F and/or HN proteins may contribute to the antigenic differences among these NDV genotypes. Geese infected with genotype VIId NDVs that were isolated from geese and chickens showed similar pathologic characteristics. NDVs that were isolated from geese did not differ in genetic, serologic, and pathogenic characteristics from those isolated from chickens, indicating that these NDVs were derived from chicken NDVs. Given the significance of geese in NDV epidemiology, effective biosecurity measures should be adopted to prevent the interspecies transmission of NDVs.

Radioimmunochemical studies on the comparison of the immunological cross-reactivity between the 7-S Igs of birds, reptiles and amphibians (IgY-like Igs) and the IgA of mammals (man and pig) using 125I-chicken IgY and anti-chicken IgY(Fc) or anti-chicken IgY(H) antibodies from rabbits and carp for the detection led to the conclusion that there are close antigenic relationships between them. Therefore, the IgY-like Igs seem to be the precursors for the IgA class of mammals. From that, we give a phylogenetic tree of Igs in accordance with the evolutionary development of vertebrates.

Previously published observations have demonstrated that murine antibody with specificity for phosphorylcholine (PC) binds to a variety of PC-containing polysaccharides and to human beta-lipoprotein. In this investigation it was found that monoclonal anti-PC antibody binds not only to human beta-lipoprotein, but also to beta-lipoprotein from the serum of all vertebrate species examined. beta-Lipoprotein from mouse reacted with autologous antibody; therefore, this antibody must be an autoantibody. This raises the question whether PC antibodies may exert unwanted effects after having been passively transferred or induced by PC-containing antigens, e.g., C-polysaccharide from pneumococci.

In this study, the prevalence and distribution of various Arcobacter spp. were investigated in samples taken from the cloacae of healthy domestic geese raised in Turkey. A membrane filtration technique with a non-selective blood agar was employed after enrichment in Arcobacter enrichment broth (AEB) to isolate a wide range of Arcobacter spp. In addition, the isolates were characterized phenotypically and identified at species level using a multiplex-PCR assay. A total of 90 cloacal swab samples taken from geese, collected on three farms (18, 25, 47 samples, respectively), were examined. Of the samples examined, 16 (18%) were found positive for Arcobacter. One Arcobacter species was isolated from each bird. Of the 16 Arcobacter isolates, 7 (44%), 7 (44%) and 2 (12.5%) were identified by m-PCR as A. cryaerophilus, A. skirrowii and A. butzleri, respectively. The present study indicates that domestic geese can harbour a variety of Arcobacter spp. in their cloacae. The presence of Arcobacter in geese may be of significance as reservoirs in their dissemination. Detailed research is needed for better understanding of the epidemiology and zoonotic potential of this emerging pathogen.

Aquatic birds play n critical role in the transmission and dissemination of many important pathogens such as avian influenza virus. The cell-mediated immunity is very important in eliminating the intracellular antigens. Expression of CD4 and CD8 on T cell surface is essential for cell-mediated immune defence and T-cell development. However, the ontogeny of T lymphocytes in waterfowl is scarce and fragmentary. To address these questions, here we report the development and tissues distribution of CD4 and CD8α in goose embryo, gosling and goose by immunocytochemistry assay using monoclonal antibodies. Moreover, the age-related mRNA level of goose CD4 and CD8α in different immune tissues were study by real time quantitative PCR. Our results suggested that the high expression of CD4 and CD8α were readily found in thymus, which peaked at the first week post-hatch. And the highest expression level of CD4 and CD8α were detected in bursa of Fabricius, caecal tonsils, spleen and intestine at the second week, after that the expression level were gradually decreased. Interestingly, the remarkably high expression of CD4 and CD8α in Harderian gland were detected at the first week, which is about hundreds times more than that in other tissues. Our findings demonstrated that the development and the distribution of CD4 and CD8α are partly changed in an age-related way. Moreover, the histological morphogenesis of immune tissues were also discussed. Our results may shed lights on the better understand of T-cell mediate immunity in goose.

Historically, surveillance for influenza A viruses (IAVs) in wild birds has relied on viral detection assays. This was largely due to poor performance of serological assays in wild birds; however, recently developed commercial serological assays have improved the ability to detect IAV antibodies in wild birds. Serological surveillance for IAV antibodies in Canada geese (Branta canadensis) has shown that, despite a low prevalence of virus isolations, Canada geese are frequently exposed to IAVs and that exposure increases with latitude, which follows virus isolation prevalence patterns observed in dabbling ducks. The objectives of this study were to further evaluate IAV antibodies in Canada geese using a subtype-specific serological assay to determine if Canada geese are exposed to subtypes that commonly circulate in dabbling ducks. We collected serum samples from Canada geese in Minnesota, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin and tested for antibodies to IAVs using a blocking ELISA. Positive samples were further tested by hemagglutination inhibition for 10 hemagglutinin IAV subtypes (H1-H10). Overall, we detected antibodies to NP in 24% (714/2919) of geese. Antibodies to H3, H4, H5, and H6 subtypes predominated, with H5 being detected most frequently. A decrease in H5 HI antibody prevalence and titers was observed from 2009 to 2012. We also detected similar exposure pattern in Canada geese from New Jersey, Minnesota, Washington and Wisconsin. Based on the published literature, H3, H4, and H6 viruses are the most commonly reported IAVs from dabbling ducks. These results indicate that Canada geese also are frequently exposed to viruses of the same HA subtypes; however, the high prevalence of antibodies to H5 viruses was not expected as H5 IAVs are generally not well represented in reported isolates from ducks.

Nontyphoid Salmonella have a broad host range in poultry and mammals, and serovar Typhimurium is a threat to public health. In this study, normal and sick ducks and geese were collected from 12 farms in Taiwan to investigate the age-associated infection of Salmonella and Salmonella Typhimurium in Roman geese (Anser anser domesticus) and Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus). In normal birds, the prevalence of Salmonella differed between species, and with age [e.g., 1-wk group, 37.5% (30/80) for ducks and 5.2% (6/116) for goslings (P < 0.05) vs. 4-wk group, 1% (1/96) for ducks and 12.1% (21/174) for geese]. Salmonella Typhimurium was identified from the visceral organs of moribund young geese suffering with colibacillosis and riemerellosis isolated from 2 goose farms (farm A and B, respectively). At farm B, 22.9% (27/118) of 4-wk geese with diarrhea were Salmonella Typhimurium-positive compared with 4.6% (8/174) of 4-wk normal geese. All Salmonella Typhimurium strains except one harbored a 94.7-kb virulence plasmid. Subcutaneous injection of Salmonella Typhimurium isolate 91NGL1 resulted in different clinical signs and pathogenesis between ducks and geese. In addition, the mean infectivity dose ratios of ducks to geese were 3.2 and 85.0 for 4- and 12-d birds, respectively, suggesting that goslings were more susceptible to Salmonella Typhimurium and resistance to Salmonella Typhimurium increased with age, especially for ducks. Therefore, Salmonella Typhimurium infection should be more common in goose farms than in duck farms, especially in the younger birds.

Mixed infections involving mycoplasmas, viruses and bacteria are well recognized in chickens. Synergism has been demonstrated between Mycoplasma gallisepticum and the viruses of Newcastle disease and infectious bronchitis and Escherichia coli, although the outcome of infection is influenced by many factors associated with the host and the organisms. Airsacculitis in broilers due to M. synoviae or M. gallinarum may be precipitated by concurrent respiratory virus infections including vaccine strains. Turkeys, geese and ducks have been less well studied, but similar interactions seem to occur. Such observations may give an indication as to the likely interactions between mycoplasmas, viruses and bacteria in other host species.

The largest epidemic of avian influenza (AI) in history attacked poultry and wild birds throughout Taiwan starting January 6, 2015. This study analyzed surveillance results, epidemiologic characteristics, and viral sequences by using government-released information, with the intention to provide recommendations to minimize future pandemic influenza. The H5 clade 2.3.4.4 highly pathogenic AI viruses (HPAIVs) had not been detected in Taiwan before 2015. During this epidemic, four types of etiologic agents were identified: the three novel subtypes H5N2, H5N8, and H5N3 clade 2.3.4.4 HPAIVs and one endemic chicken H5N2 subtype (Mexican-like lineage) of low pathogenic AI viruses. Cocirculation of mixed subtypes also occurred, with H5N2 clade 2.3.4.4 HPAIVs accompanied by the H5N8 and H5N3 subtypes or old H5N2 viruses in the same farm. More than 90% of domestic geese died from this AI epidemic; geese were affected the most at the early outbreaks. The epidemic peaked in mid-January for all three novel H5 subtypes. Spatial epidemiology found that most affected areas were located in southwestern coastal areas. In terrestrial poultry (mostly chickens), different geographic distributions of AI virus subtypes were detected, with hot spots of H5N2 clade 2.3.4.4 vs. past-endemic old H5N2 viruses in Changhwa (P = 0.03) and Yunlin (P = 0.007) counties, respectively, of central Taiwan. Phylogenetic and sequence analyses of all the early 10 Taiwan H5 clade 2.3.4.4 isolates covering the three subtypes showed that they were very different from the HA of the past local H5 viruses from domestic ducks (75%-80%) and chickens (70%-75%). However, they had the highest sequence identity percentages (99.53%-100%), with the HA of A/crane/Kagoshima/KU13/2014(H5N8) isolated on December 7, 2014, in Japan being higher than those of recent American and Korean H5 HPAIVs [A/Northern pintail/Washington/40964/2014 (H5N2) and A/gyrfalcon/Washington/41088-6/2014 (H5N8): 99.02%-99.54% and A/Baikal teal/Korea/Donglim3/2014 (H5N8): 98.61%-99.08%], implying a likely common ancestor of these H5 clade 2.3.4.4 viruses. The multiple subtypes of H5 clade 2.3.4.4 HPAIVs imply high viral reassortment. We recommend establishing an integrated surveillance system, involving clinical, virologic, and serologic surveillance in poultry and wild birds, swine and other mammals prevalent on multiple-animal mixed-type traditional farms, and high-risk human populations, as a crucially important step to minimize future pandemic influenza.

Treatment of fetal rat and embryonic chicken with exogenous glucocorticoids induces premature differentiation of growth hormone (GH) secreting cells. The effect of corticosterone (CORT) on somatotroph differentiation was mostly studied in pituitary cells in vitro. Currently, there is no evidence for glucocorticoid-mediated induction of somatotroph differentiation during pituitary development in bird species other than chicken. In this study, we sought to find out if in ovo injection of corticosterone into developing goose embryos could induce premature increase of GH in somatotrophs. On embryonic day (e) 15, the albumen of fertile goose eggs was injected with 300 μl of 0.9% saline, 300 μl 5 × 10-8M CORT, or 300 μl 5 × 10-6 M CORT. Embryos were allowed to develop until e20 and e28 and isolated pituitaries were subjected to quantitative real-time PCR and immunocytochemistry to detect GH mRNA and protein, respectively. At e20 and e28, blood from chorioallantoic vessels was subjected to radioimmunoassay for analysis of plasma GH protein. In ovo administration of exogenous corticosterone brought about a 2.5-fold increase in the expression of GH mRNA and increased the in situ expression of GH protein in goose pituitary cells, and enhanced plasma GH levels compared to that of the respective controls at e20. These findings prove that administration of glucocorticoid could stimulate the expression of GH in somatotrophs during goose embryonic development. Our results suggest the probable involvement of membrane glucocorticoid receptor in the corticosterone mediated expression of GH. Together with previously published data, our results suggest that corticosterone mediated induction of GH expression during embryonic development is relatively conserved among different vertebrates.

No country is fully prepared for a 1918-like pandemic influenza. Averting a pandemic of H5N1 influenza virus depends on the successful control of its endemicity, outbreaks in poultry and occasional spillage into human which carries a case-fatality rate of over 50%. The use of perimetric depopulation and vaccination has failed to halt the spread of the epidemic. Blanket vaccination for all poultry over a large geographical area is difficult. A combination of moratorium, segregation of water fowls from chickens and vaccination have been proved to be effective in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) since 2002 despite endemicity and outbreaks in neighbouring regions. Systematic surveillance in southern China showed that ducks and geese are the primary reservoirs which transmit the virus to chickens, minor poultry and even migratory birds.

cDNA encoding goose IL-2 (GoIL-2) was cloned from Con A-stimulated goose splenic mononuclear cells (SMC) using oligonucleotide primers based on the conserved sequence of duck (DuIL-2), chicken (ChIL-2) and turkey IL-2s (TuIL-2). The GoIL-2 cDNA is 718nt long, which contains an open reading frame (ORF) of 423 base pairs encoding a protein of 141 aa. The GoIL-2 shows, respectively, 79%, 82-85%, and 91-92% identities with TuIL-2, ChIL-2 and DuIL-2 in cDNA, and also shows, respectively, 63%, 63-64%, and 82-85% identities with TuIL-2, ChIL-2 and DuIL-2 in amino acid sequence. Recombinant GoIL-2 (rGoIL-2) protein expressed in Escherichia coli has an approximate molecular weight of 18kDa. The rGoIL-2 has biological effect on goose and duck as well as chicken lymphocytes in a dose-dependent manner, though the effect on duck and chicken lymphocytes has been found to be relatively weak. In addition, rGoIL-2 also strengthens goose immune responses induced by vaccinating the inactivated oil emulsion vaccine against avian influenza virus. The monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to rGoIL-2 recognized the binding epitopes of nature GoIL-2 protein expressed in vero cells. Antiserum and mAb 5B10 to rGoIL-2 can inhibit the biological activity of rGoIL-2 and endogenous GoIL-2. The results, at the first time, indicated that goose IL-2 reserves species-specialties in the biological functions and can be used as a potential immunoadjuvant for goose vaccination and immunotherapeutic purposes. Finally, the mAbs to rGoIL-2 also provide a useful tool for further immunobiological studies of IL-2 in avian immune systems.

We describe the identification and functional analysis of an evolutionary distinct new avian hepadnavirus. Infection of snow geese (Anser caerulescens) with a duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV)-related virus, designated SGHBV, was demonstrated by detection of envelope proteins in sera with anti-DHBV preS and S antibodies. Comparative sequence analysis of the PCR-amplified SGHBV genomes revealed unique SGHBV sequence features compared with other avian hepadnaviruses. Unlike DHBV, SGHBV shows an open reading frame in an analogous position to orthohepadnavirus X genes. Four of five cloned genomes were competent in replication, gene expression, and virus particle secretion in chicken hepatoma cells. Primary duck hepatocytes were permissive for infection with SGHBV, suggesting a similar or identical host range. SGHBV was found to secrete a significant fraction of virion-like particles containing single-stranded viral DNA. This was observed both in cell culture medium of SGHBV DNA-transfected LMH cells and in viremic sera of several birds, suggesting that it is a stable trait of SGHBV. Taken together, SGHBV has several unique features that expand the knowledge of the functional and evolutionary diversity of hepadnaviruses and offers new experimental opportunities for studies on the life cycle of hepadnaviruses.

Mutant prevention concentration (MPC) is an alternative pharmacodynamic parameter that has been used to measure antimicrobial activity and represents the propensities of antimicrobial agents to select resistant mutants. The concentration range between minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and MPC is defined as mutant selection window (MSW). The MPC and MSW parameters represent the ability of antimicrobial agents to inhibit the bacterial mutants selected. This study was conducted to determine the MIC and MPC values of four antimicrobials including ceftiofur, cefquinome, florfenicol and tilmicosin against 105 Riemerella anatipestifer isolates.

Using the reagent kits for detecting human HBV, primary serologic investigation was made in 6 kinds of domestic animals and fowls (total 673) by ELISA, spot hybridization and immuno-electronmicroscopy. The results showed that some sera samples of pigs, rabbits, chicken and geese were HBsAg, HBeAg positive and positive for spot hybridization by using 3(2)P-HBV-DNA probe, which suggested that HBV-like viruses might exist in those domestic animals and fowls. HBV-like virus particles were seen in one pig serum sample which was HBsAg positive. The particles could be divided into three forms in shape, large spherical particle (40-55nm), small spherical particle (20-30nm) and short filament particle. The further studies are needed.

This paper describes the pathologic features of a malignant Sertoli cell tumor found in an adult goose (Anser cygnoides domesticus). At necropsy, in addition to one large tumor mass (15 cm in diameter), multiple small tumor masses were observed over the peritoneum and mesenterium in the coelomic cavity. The large tumor mass was composed of sheets, lobules, and small islands of tumor cells, and elongated tumor cells lying perpendicular to fibrous connective tissue were characteristic. Such histopathologic characteristics were common to all the tumors. The tumor cells were immunohistochemically positive for neuron-specific enolase and S-100, and some tumor cells contained fine intracytoplasmic pigments that stained red by oil red O staining. These findings, taken together with the fact that one testis was markedly atrophied and bore no tumor cells and the other testis was not discernible, the present case was diagnosed as unilateral malignant Sertoli cell tumor arising from the unilateral testis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Sertoli cell tumor in the goose.

A very low virus level was found for a short time in the blood of ducklings and goslings after experimental Lednice (Yaba 1) virus infection by subcutaneous (scut) and intranasal (inas) route and in blood of ducklings also after infection by intracerebral (icer) route. Subsequently virus neutralizing antibody formation was examined. Antibody formation was found in most of animals. In goslings onset of antibody formation seems to be slower than in ducklings after the same virus infection dose; vice versa, in ducklings antibody titer decreased after 6 weeks. Using low infection virus dose, neutralizing antibody level in ducklings was lower than in the former case. On examining the blood and the organs, the virus was detected in a very low amount and for a very short time in blood and spleen of goslings and only in blood of ducklings.

Circulating H7N9 influenza viruses in live poultry markets continue to pose a threat to human health. Free-range poultry, one of the sources for these markets, are common in China as well as in many developing countries. Because the H9N2 virus could be a source of internal genes for the H7N9 virus, we conducted surveillance in free-range poultry and live poultry markets to study the evolution of H7N9 and H9N2 viruses in Eastern China. We found 28 samples positive for the H9N2 virus (a rate of 3.2%), but no positive samples for the H7N9 virus. Six representative H9N2 isolates were sequenced and analyzed, and the results showed that these viruses shared high nucleotide identities (99.0 to 100%) and were in a same branch in the phylogenetic trees. All these 6 viruses are closely clustered with Zhejiang H9N2 chicken isolates, and belonged to genotype G57, along with some novel H7N9 strains and H9N2 strains circulating in humans in China. We hope that surveillance of AIVs in free-range poultry will be strengthened for further identification more genetic diversity.

Screening wild birds for viral pathogens has become increasingly important. We tested a screening approach based on blood and cloacal and tracheal swabs collected by hunters to study the prevalence of influenza A, paramyxo-, flavi-, and alphaviruses in Finnish wild waterfowl, which has been previously unknown. We studied 310 blood samples and 115 mixed tracheal and cloacal swabs collected from hunted waterfowl in 2006. Samples were screened by RT-PCR and serologically by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for influenza A (FLUAV), type 1 avian paramyxo-(APMV-1), Sindbis (SINV), West Nile (WNV) and tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV) virus infections.

Indigenous communities in Boreal environments rely on locally-harvested wild foods for sustenance. These foods provide many nutritional benefits including higher levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs; such as ω-3) than what is commonly found in store-bought foods. However, wild foods can be a route of exposure to dietary mercury and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Here, we show a strong association between the frequency of wild food consumption in adults (N=72) from two remote First Nations communities of Northern Ontario and environmental contaminants in blood (POPs) and hair (mercury). We observed that POPs and mercury were on average 3.5 times higher among those consuming wild foods more often, with many frequent wild food consumers exceeding Canadian and international health guidelines for PCB and mercury exposures. Contaminants in locally-harvested fish and game from these communities were sufficiently high that many participants exceeded the monthly consumption limits for methylmercury and PCBs. Those consuming more wild foods also had higher proportions of potentially beneficial ω-3 fatty acids including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). These results show that the benefits of traditional dietary choices in Boreal regions of Canada must be weighed against the inherent risks of contaminant exposure from these foods.

It is known that endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) contributes to insulin resistance (IR) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in mammals. However, we recently demonstrated that overfeeding with a traditional diet (mainly consisting of cooked maize) does not induce ERS in goose. As cellular studies show that high glucose and palmitate can trigger ERS in mammalian cells, we hypothesized that supplementing sugar to the traditional diet could induce ERS, thus promoting insulin resistance and fatty liver. To test the hypothesis, we first treated goose primary hepatocytes with high glucose (25 mM and 50 mM) and palmitate (0.5 mM) supplemented with or without 0.25 mM oleate. Data indicated that, as in mammalian cells, high glucose and palmitate indeed induced ERS in goose primary hepatocytes, and palmitate-induced ERS was suppressed by supplemental 0.25 mM oleate. We then tested the hypothesis with an in vivo study, in which Landes geese overfed with traditional or novel diets (i.e., the traditional diet supplemented with sugar) were compared with control geese (normally fed with cooked maize) for ERS, IR and fatty liver. The differences in glucose tolerance, insulin tolerance and postprandial blood glucose between the geese overfed with traditional and novel diets suggested that supplementing dietary sugar promoted IR. This promotion was accompanied with an increasing trend of liver weight and abdominal fat weight relative to body weight. Surprisingly, compared to overfeeding with the traditional diet, overfeeding with the novel diet did not induce ERS, even further suppressed ERS in goose fatty liver. Together, our findings suggest that supplementing dietary sugar promotes ERS-independent IR and fatty liver in goose. It is intriguing to discover the factor(s) protecting goose liver from ERS as well as the non-ERS mechanism underlying IR.

Nineteen goslings with pulmonary and systemic aspergillosis were the subject of the study. The lungs and air sacs were the main sites affected by the disease, and were generally characterised by diffuse yellowish-white granulomas. In 7 cases with pulmonary and air-sac involvement the granulomas were scattered to the serosal linings of the gastrointestinal and upper respiratory tracts, to the liver, spleen and kidneys, and in two cases also to the bursa of Fabricius, musculus (m.) longus colli and adventitia of aorta. The granulomas were often characterised by a necrotic centre surrounded by heterophils, macrophages, lymphocyte and plasma cells, and in late granulomas by multinucleated foreign-body giant cells, and again by an outer thin fibrous capsule. Numerous fungal hyphae were found within the necrotic debris of the granulomas by Gridley and PAS staining techniques. Immunohistochemistry reliably confirmed aspergillosis in all of the cases. Fungal elements in the lungs of goslings severely affected by the disease stained heavily within the centre of the granulomas, whereas few antigens reacted in the chronic cases. Fungal fragments, which were not discernible using routine fungal stains, reacted clearly in the cytoplasm of macrophages and giant cells. Thus, although fungal elements within the granulomas were histologically indicative of aspergillosis, immunohistochemistry also had to be applied to obtain a definitive diagnosis of the disease and to differentiate it from many of the filamentous fungi.

Venous occipital sinus blood sampling was demonstrated to be an effective nonlethal method in all species tested including ducks, geese, Chukar partridge, Japanese quail, pea-fowl, pheasants, parakeets, turkeys, and chickens. Maximum blood volume obtained from the occipital sinus of 1-day-old chicks equalled the volume obtained by cardiac puncture and exceeded the volume collected by decapitation. Venous occipital sinus puncture was successfully used to rapidly collect several successive blood samples from individual birds, thus indicating the method's utility for serial blood sampling. Hematocrit values, as well as infectious bronchitis and Newcastle disease virus antibody titers measured in blood samples drawn from the occipital sinus and the brachial vein, were compared. Significant correlation coefficients between the two blood sources for each of the variables measured suggest that occipital sinus blood sampling may be substituted for venipuncture for many routine measurements.

Actinomycin D (AMD) and ethidium bromide (EB) were found to bind to chromatin isolated from a variety of gander tissues according to a strong and weak process analogous to that found for deproteinized DNA. Distribution of the dye intercalation sites in chromatin and DNA were evaluated at low r-values (dye bound per nucleotide) by following the appearance of free dye released from chromatin and DNA during thermal denaturation. The AMD dissociation profiles closely resembled the DNA or chromatin-DNA denaturation profiles; whereas the EB derivative dissociation profiles, indicated 3 major transitions for transcriptionally active chromatin with the main component corresponding to the single component which characterizes DNA. The DNA-like component was greatly reduced for mature erythrocyte chromatin but could be generated by removal of histone I and V. Removal of residual non acid-soluble proteins from dehistonized chromatin, urea treatment or dissociation and reconstitution of chromatin favoured conversion to the DNA-like component with loss of the other two. This study indicates that more than one type of binding exists generally in chromatin.

Four isolants of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) obtained from free-flying Canada geese in the Atlantic flyway were characterized and compared with the B1, LaSota, Roakin, and Texas-GB strains of NDV. The 4 isolants were identified as lentogenic strains on the basis of embryo mean death times of greater than 100 hours and relative lack of pathogenicity for 1-day-old and 3-week-old chickens. The hemagglutinin of 2 of the isolants was stable at 56 C for 15 minutes, 1 for 30 minutes, and the other for at least 2 hours. When held at 4 C for 24 hours, none of the 4 isolants could be eluted from chicken erythrocytes. All 4 of the isolants produced plaques in chicken embryo fibroblast cell cultures without additives, whereas the B1 and LaSota strains did not. The 4 lentogenic NDV isolants from Canada geese differed in many respects from currently used commerical vaccine strains (B1 and LaSota).

Mortality in ducks and geese caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) infection had not been previously identified in Bangladesh. In June-July 2011, we investigated mortality in ducks, geese and chickens with suspected H5N1 infection in a north-eastern district of the country to identify the aetiologic agent and extent of the outbreak and identify possible associated human infections. We surveyed households and farms with affected poultry flocks in six villages in Netrokona district and collected cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs from sick birds and tissue samples from dead poultry. We conducted a survey in three of these villages to identify suspected human influenza-like illness cases and collected nasopharyngeal and throat swabs. We tested all swabs by real-time RT-PCR, sequenced cultured viruses, and examined tissue samples by histopathology and immunohistochemistry to detect and characterize influenza virus infection. In the six villages, among the 240 surveyed households and 11 small-scale farms, 61% (1789/2930) of chickens, 47% (4816/10 184) of ducks and 73% (358/493) of geese died within 14 days preceding the investigation. Of 70 sick poultry swabbed, 80% (56/70) had detectable RNA for influenza A/H5, including 89% (49/55) of ducks, 40% (2/5) of geese and 50% (5/10) of chickens. We isolated virus from six of 25 samples; sequence analysis of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase gene of these six isolates indicated clade 2.3.2.1a of H5N1 virus. Histopathological changes and immunohistochemistry staining of avian influenza viral antigens were recognized in the brain, pancreas and intestines of ducks and chickens. We identified ten human cases showing signs compatible with influenza-like illness; four were positive for influenza A/H3; however, none were positive for influenza A/H5. The recently introduced H5N1 clade 2.3.2.1a virus caused unusually high mortality in ducks and geese. Heightened surveillance in poultry is warranted to guide appropriate diagnostic testing and detect novel influenza strains.

Four new H9N2 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) were isolated from domestic birds in Guangdong between December 2015 and April 2016. Nucleotide sequence comparisons indicated that most of the internal genes of these four strains were highly similar to those of human H7N9 viruses. Amino acid substitutions and deletions found in the HA and NA proteins indicated that all four of these new isolates may have an enhanced ability to infect humans and other mammals. A cross-hemagglutinin-inhibition assay, conducted with two vaccine strains that are broadly used in China, suggested that antisera against vaccine candidates could not provide complete inhibition of the new isolates.

The hemagglutinin (HA) genes from four avian H7N7 influenza A isolates, from a single outbreak, were shown to possess different cleavage sites that contain varying numbers of basic amino acid residues (KKKKR, KRKKR, KKRKKR, KKKKKKR). All four variants are highly pathogenic in chickens and share an immediate common ancestral HA with A/tern/Potsdam/342-6/79 (H7N7) and A/swan/Potsdam/63-6/81 (H7N7). These viruses are nonpathogenic and contain no extra basic amino acids at the cleavage site of their HA. During evolution a common precursor virus acquired different sequences at the cleavage site of the HA and became highly pathogenic in chickens. In vitro assays revealed that the HA from A/chicken/Leipzig/79 with KKKKR at the cleavage site was only partially cleaved (41%), compared to 93-100% cleavage of the other HAs. Since all four viruses were highly pathogenic in chickens, these findings confirm that the degree of pathogenicity in vivo is not exclusively determined by the degree of HA cleavability.

The role of live bird markets (LBMs) in the perpetuation of avian influenza virus (AIV) has been well studied worldwide; however, there is a paucity of information on the prevalence of different AIV subtypes in LBMs in Eastern China. In this study, long-term surveillance was conducted to investigate the prevalence of AIV in chickens, ducks, and geese in an LBM in Yangzhou city, Jiangsu province, Eastern China, between July 2002 and May 2011. The study used primary virus isolation and subtype-specific reverse-transcription-PCR. In total, 23 different HA-NA subtype combinations were detected, mainly in domestic ducks. This result suggests that domestic ducks play a more important role in LBMs in Eastern China.

West Nile virus (WNV) is endemic throughout Africa, Eurasia, America, and Australia and has important implications for avian, horse, and human health. In these regions, dead birds are monitored for the presence of WNV through immunohistochemistry (IHC) and PCR. However, a number of the tools for IHC are inadequate owing to their cross-reactivity to other Japanese encephalitis serogroup viruses. Here we have established eight monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to WNV. Four of them bound to the envelope protein, three of them bound to nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), and one bound to precursor membrane protein (prM), as shown by Western blot analysis. The anti-NS1 MAbs and the anti-prM MAb did not cross-react with Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Murray valley encephalitis virus, or St. Louis encephalitis virus in an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. One NS1-specific MAb, SHW-32B1, and the previously reported NS1-specific MAb, SHW-7A11, were shown by IHC to specifically detect the cytoplasm of degenerated cells in the heart and brain of a WNV-infected goose. Neither of these MAbs were shown by IHC to cross-react with degenerated cells in the brain of a JEV-infected pig. These MAbs are the first reported anti-NS1 MAbs that can be used for WNV-specific IHC using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections. They may be useful for WNV research and surveillance.

Fatty acid synthase is regulated by diet and hormones, with regulation being primarily transcriptional. In chick embryo hepatocytes in culture, triiodothyronine stimulates accumulation of enzyme and transcription of the gene. Since the 5'-flanking region of this gene is likely involved in hormonal regulation of its expression, we have isolated and partially characterized an avian fatty acid synthase gene. A genomic DNA library was constructed in a cosmid vector and screened with cDNA clones that contained sequence complementary to the 3' end of goose fatty acid synthase mRNA. A genomic clone (approximately 35 kilobase pairs (kb] was isolated, and a 6.5-kb EcoRI fragment thereof contained DNA complementary to the 3' noncoding region of fatty acid synthase mRNA. Additional cosmid libraries were screened with 5' fragments of previously isolated genomic clones, resulting in the isolation of five overlapping cosmid DNAs. The entire region of cloned DNA spans approximately 105 kb. Exon-containing fragments were identified by hybridization with end-labeled poly(A)+ RNA and by hybridization of labeled exon-containing genomic DNA fragments to fatty acid synthase mRNA. A new set of cDNA clones spanning approximately 3.2 kb was isolated from a lambda-ZAP goose liver cDNA library using the 5'-most exon-containing fragment of the 5'-most genomic DNA clone. This region of mRNA contains a 5'-untranslated sequence and a continuous open reading frame which includes a region that codes for the essential cysteine of the beta-ketoacyl synthase domain. The entire fatty acid synthase gene spans about 50 kb. The 5' 15 kb of the gene contain 7 exons. S1 nuclease and primer extension analyses were used to identify a single site for initiation of transcription, 174 nucleotides upstream from the putative translation initiation codon. Putative "TATA" and "CCAAT" boxes are located 28 and 60 base pairs (bp), respectively, upstream of the site of initiation of transcription. The 5'-flanking 597 bp of DNA contains G/C-rich sequences including several "GC" boxes corresponding to binding sites for the nuclear transcription factor Sp1. Putative sites for AP-2, C/EBP, and the triiodothyronine and glucocorticoid receptors also were found in this region. A chimeric DNA, containing approximately 1.6 kb of 5'-flanking sequence and 139 bp of untranslated sequence of the goose fatty acid synthase gene ligated to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase (CAT) gene, was transfected into chick embryo hepatocytes in culture. Cells treated with triiodothyronine contained increased chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and fatty acid synthase activities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).

Riemerella anatipestifer is a Gram-negative bacterium that can cause disease in a wide range of wild and domesticated birds, especially waterfowl. The presence of an antibiotic-resistance gene in R. anatipestifer has not yet been reported, indicating the need for investigation. In the present study, 40.5% of R. anatipestifer isolates were found to exhibit resistance to chloramphenicol, while 45.9% showed intermediate resistance and 13.5% were susceptible to chloramphenicol, an antibiotic that has been prohibited for use in food animals in Taiwan since 2003. The resistance gene was identified as the cat gene and cloned by library sequencing. The prevalence of the cat gene in Taiwanese R. anatipestifer isolates was 78.4%. The position of the cat gene was then determined within the novel plasmid, designated pRA0511. pRA0511 was sequenced and shown to be 11,435 bp in size with 10 open reading frames (ORFs). Proteins putatively encoded by these 10 ORFs included four drug-resistance-associated proteins. Two proteins designed as chloramphenicol acetyltransferases (CATs) were encoded by two non-adjacent ORFs, and the other two were TetX2 and a multi-drug ABC transporter permease/ATPase. The putative CAT protein had 62.9 to 79.5% homology to a known type B CAT. The pRA0511 plasmid is the first identified drug-resistance plasmid in R. anatipestifer, more specifically associated with chloramphenicol resistance.

Fecal samples were taken from 132 (103 wild and 29 domestic) aquatic birds on selected areas in Hungary from February 2008 to March 2008. Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts were purified from the samples and were viewed via fluorescent antibody staining. Molecular detection tools, such as PCR-sequencing and Loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) were used in order to determine the Cryptosporidium species and Giardia duodenalis assemblages present. All together 6 (5.8%) and 6 (5.8%) samples out of the 103 wild bird samples and 4 (13%) and 7 (24%) samples out of the 29 domestic bird samples have been found to be Cryptosporidium and G. duodenalis positive respectively. The results of this study indicate that aquatic ducks, geese, coot and cormorant can play role in the environmental dissemination of human pathogenic Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts in Hungary. To our knowledge, this is the first description of Cryptosporidium sp. in Anser fabalis and Anser anser, furthermore Giardia sp. in Fulica atra, A. fabalis and P. carbo and the first PCR-sequence confirmed detection of C. parvum in A. platyrhynchos and F. atra, G. duodenalis Assemblage A in A. strepera and G. duodenalis Assemblage B in A. anser.

Outbreaks of haemorrhagic nephritis and enteritis of geese (HNEG) have been reported in goose flocks in Hungary, Germany and France since 1969. HNEG is characterized by high morbidity and mortality rates in geese 3 to 10 weeks of age. The causative agent of HNEG is the goose haemorrhagic polyomavirus (GHPV), which has a circular double-stranded DNA genome encoding the structural proteins VP1, VP2 and VP3. In vitro culture of GHPV has been problematic, so the baculovirus system was used to construct a recombinant virus expressing the VP1 gene of GHPV under control of the polyhedrin promoter in Sf9 insect cells. The expression and the identity of recombinant goose polyomavirus VP1 in the crude Sf9 cell extracts were confirmed by mass spectrometry. Experimental oil-emulsion vaccines containing two different doses of antigen were prepared using this crude extract. Goslings were vaccinated either once at 1 day old or twice by boosting 18 days after the primary vaccination, and were challenged with a virulent polyomavirus isolate at 5 weeks of age. A single injection of either vaccine dose induced 95% protection against challenge. Using the booster vaccination regimen, 100% protection was achieved with either vaccine dose.

The morphogenesis of the new type gosling viral enteritis virus (NGVEV) and the characteristic ultrastructural changes in the duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs) were investigated by ultrathin sectioning and transmission electron microscopy after monolayer DEFs were experimentally infected with a virulent NGVEV strain. The investigation demonstrated that typical NGVEV particles were round, with a diameter ranging from 75 nm to 90 nm and that they were present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of the infected DEFs. The mature virions contained nucleocapsids and nucleic acids. The virion penetrated the DEF, replicated, and matured in the nucleus, and they were finally released into the extracellular space via budding and disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane. With the appearance of progeny NGVEV, certain virus-related structures that were densely electron stained, which were circular, U-shaped, or irregular in appearance, could be observed in the cytoplasm of the infected DEFs. In this research, we first detected three types of intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies during the NGVEV infection, which always contained a number of NGVEV particles. Furthermore, we detected that NGVEV could induce apoptosis in DEFs, which had not been reported previously. The morphologic changes of apoptosis included shrinking of the apoptotic cells, chromatin condensation and margination, appearance of vacuoles on the cytoplasmic membrane, and the formation of apoptotic bodies. The mitochondria were ultracondensed and aggregated into compact clusters during apoptosis.

To address the role of bacterial infection in hatching failure of wild geese, we monitored embryo development in a breeding population of Greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons) on the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska. During 2013, we observed mortality of normally developing embryos and collected 36 addled eggs for analysis. We also collected 17 infertile eggs for comparison. Using standard culture methods and gene sequencing to identify bacteria within collected eggs, we identified a potentially novel species of Neisseria in 33 eggs, Macrococcus caseolyticus in 6 eggs, and Streptococcus uberis and Rothia nasimurium in 4 eggs each. We detected seven other bacterial species at lower frequencies. Sequences of the 16S rRNA genes from the Neisseria isolates most closely matched sequences from N. animaloris and N. canis (96 to 97% identity), but phylogenetic analysis suggested substantial genetic differentiation between egg isolates and known Neisseria species. Although definitive sources of the bacteria remain unknown, we detected Neisseria DNA from swabs of eggshells, nest contents, and cloacae of nesting females. To assess the pathogenicity of bacteria identified in contents of addled eggs, we inoculated isolates of Neisseria, Macrococcus, Streptococcus, and Rothia at various concentrations into developing chicken eggs. Seven-day mortality rates varied from 70 to 100%, depending on the bacterial species and inoculation dose. Our results suggest that bacterial infections are a source of embryo mortality in wild geese in the Arctic.

The rates of synthesis of fatty acid synthase and the levels of its mRNA are high in livers of chicks, ducklings, or goslings fed high-carbohydrate mash diets and low in livers of starved birds, indicating pretranslational regulation of fatty acid synthase activity. Determination of the step(s) at which the nutritional state regulates the fatty acid synthase mRNA level was the objective of this study. Total RNA extracted from gosling or duckling liver contains two discrete fatty acid synthase transcripts, one of about 12,200 nucleotides and the other about 10,800 nucleotides. Both mRNAs are transcribed from the same gene because there is only one fatty acid synthase gene/haploid genome. A combination of 1) comparison of restriction fragment lengths in genomic DNA and cloned fatty acid synthase cDNAs, 2) differential hybridization of cloned cDNAs to the two mRNAs, and 3) sequence analysis indicates that the longer mRNA is a 3'-extension of the shorter one. The half-lives for fatty acid synthase mRNAs in fed ducklings and in starved ducklings were estimated from the rate at which mRNA level approached steady state during starvation or refeeding. The amount of fatty acid synthase mRNA in total liver RNA increased rapidly when starved ducklings were fed a high-carbohydrate mash diet, reaching an apparent steady state of 10 times the initial level after 9 h. The kinetics of accumulation suggested a half-life of 4-6 h for fatty acid synthase mRNA in fed ducklings. When fed ducklings were starved, fatty acid synthase mRNA decayed with a half-life of about 3 h. Therefore, the half-life for fatty acid synthase mRNA appeared to be little affected by feeding or starvation. The levels of both mRNAs changed in parallel indicating that half-lives of the two mRNAs were not regulated differentially. Transcription of the fatty acid synthase gene, as measured in isolated nuclei, increased about 10-fold when starved ducklings were refed for 24-30 h. Most of the increase in transcription occurred within 45 min after feeding was initiated. However, when fed ducklings were starved, the initial decrease in fatty acid synthase mRNA level occurred more rapidly than the decrease in transcription of the fatty acid synthase gene, indicating some degree of post-transcriptional regulation. Nevertheless, after 48 h of starvation, both mRNA level and transcription were decreased to the same extent. Nutritional state, therefore, regulates the transcription of two fatty acid synthase mRNAs from a unique gene. In addition, transient regulation occurs at an as yet undefined post-transcriptional step.

A serotype-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed for detection and identification of Pasteurella multocida serotype 1, the causative agent of avian cholera in wild waterfowl. Arbitrarily primed PCR was used to detect DNA fragments that distinguish serotype 1 from the other 15 serotypes of P. multocida (with the exception of serotype 14). Oligonucleotide primers were constructed from these sequences, and a PCR assay was optimized and evaluated. PCR reactions consistently resulted in amplification products with reference strains 1 and 14 and all other serotype 1 strains tested, with cell numbers as low as 2.3 cells/ml. No amplification products were produced with other P. multocida serotypes or any other bacterial species tested. To compare the sensitivity and further test the specificity of this PCR assay with traditional culturing and serotyping techniques, tissue samples from 84 Pekin ducks inoculated with field strains of P. multocida and 54 wild lesser snow geese collected during an avian cholera outbreak were provided by other investigators working on avian cholera. PCR was as sensitive (58/64) as routine isolation (52/64) in detecting and identifying P. multocida serotype 1 from the livers of inoculated Pekins that became sick or died from avian cholera. No product was amplified from tissues of 20 other Pekin ducks that received serotypes other than type 1 (serotype 3, 12 x 3, or 10) or 12 control birds. Of the 54 snow geese necropsied and tested for P. multocida, our PCR detected and identified the bacteria from 44 compared with 45 by direct isolation. The serotype-specific PCR we developed was much faster and less labor intensive than traditional culturing and serotyping procedures and could result in diagnosis of serotype 1 pasteurellosis within 24 hr of specimen submission.

The results of studies of the quantitative values of nonspecific antihemagglutinins of influenza viruses in the sera of birds, laboratory, wild and domestic animals (altogether 27 species) are presented. The antiviral inhibitors characterized by a number of physicochemical properties (sensitivity to heating, KIO4, trypsin, rivanol, 2-mercaptoethanol) were divided into 3 groups, sera of sheep, goats and cattle making up a separate group with regard to their sensitivity to heating and treatment with KIO4. Studies using molecular screen chromatography demonstrated the nonspecific inhibitors present in bovine sera to be heterogenous both in type (thermolabile and thermostable) and in the molecular composition. Alongside with thermolabile inhibitors of macroglobulin nature, thermostabe 19S and 4S inhibitors were identified.

PCB, p,p'-DDE, and mirex levels were examined in blood plasma samples of 232 anglers from Cornwall and Mississauga, Ontario, in a pilot study to establish the feasibility and suitability of using a cohort of Ontario fish license holders for large-scale health studies. Great Lakes fish, waterfowl, and ocean fish consumption were examined as predictors of contaminant levels using regression analysis, with adjustment for age, gender, and community. Levels of Great Lakes fish and waterfowl consumption and contaminant levels were generally low in comparison with those observed in other Great Lakes studies. However, even within these low levels, Great Lakes fish consumption was associated with increased blood plasma PCB levels in men and mirex levels in both men and women. Waterfowl consumption was associated with higher plasma PCB (men and women), DDE (men only), and mirex levels (men and Cornwall women), and requires further exploration. We conclude that other study designs are required (to identify high consumers) for carrying out studies of health effects associated with high levels of Great Lakes fish and waterfowl consumption.

Colibacillosis is the most frequent bacterial disease in avian species and antimicrobials are the main weapon to reduce incidence and mortality associated to it. However, indiscriminate use of antibiotics may lead to therapy failure and economic losses for the breeder. The aims of this study were to, determine the antibiotic resistance of Escherichia coli isolates, evaluate the correlation between E. coli isolation and systems of breeding included in this study, and identify the avian pathogenic E.coli (APEC) amongst the E. coli strains isolated. A total of 51 E. coli strains were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility test and they were screened for the presence of virulence genes through PCR. Resistance was most frequently detected against ampicillin and nalidixic acid meanwhile E. coli isolates showed less resistance to the cephalosporins. Overall, 40% of the isolates showed resistance to at least three or more antimicrobials and 16/51 isolates were defined APEC strains. The virulence genes iucD, cvi/cva, irp2 and iss were detected from all 16 APEC strains. The virulence genes tsh, vat, papC, and astA were detected from 11, 7, 5 and 3 APEC strains, respectively. Results demonstrated the importance of studies on APEC and antibiotic resistance genes in Italy, and it was shown that the systems of breeding might influence the antibiotic resistanc.

Little is known about the ecology and evolution of avian influenza in the natural environment, despite how these affect the potential for transmission. Most work has focused on characterizing viruses isolated from hosts such as waterfowl, and there have also been several instances of isolation and detection from abiotic sources such as water and ice. We used RT-PCR to amplify and characterize the influenza virus sequences present in sediments of ponds that are used heavily by waterfowl. The detection rate of influenza virus was high (>50%). Characterization of the viruses present by sequencing part of the haemagglutinin (HA) gene showed that there is a diverse collection of viruses in these sediments. We sequenced 117 partial HA gene clones from 11 samples and detected four different HA subtypes (H3, H8, H11 and H12), with approximately 65% of clone sequences being unique. This culture-independent approach was also able to detect a virus subtype that was not found by sampling of birds in the same geographical region in the same year. Viruses were detected readily in the winter when the ponds were frozen, indicating that these sediments could be a year-to-year reservoir of viruses to infect birds using the ponds, although we have not shown that these viruses are viable. We demonstrate that this approach is a feasible and valuable way to assess the prevalence and diversity of viruses present in the environment, and can be a valuable complement to more difficult viral culturing in attempting to understand the ecology of influenza viruses.

Ten one-day-old goslings were inoculated orally with a Brachyspira alvinipulli strain isolated from the large intestine of geese that had died of intestinal spirochaetosis (Group A), 10 day-old goslings were inoculated orally with a B. hyodysenteriae strain (Group B), and a third group of 10 goslings (Group C) served as uninfected control. The goslings were observed daily for clinical signs. They were sacrificed on days 7, 14, 21 and 35 days postinfection (PI), and necropsied. Segments of the large intestine were subjected to histopathological, immunohistochemical, electron microscopic (TEM, SEM) and microbiological examinations. Mortality did not occur during the experimental period. However, in both groups the caecum of the goslings killed by bleeding was slightly dilated, in its lumen there was a watery, yellowish and frothy content, and the mucous membrane was slightly swollen. By histopathological, immunohistochemical and electron microscopic examination, B. alvinipulli and B. hyodysenteriae could be detected in the caecum or colon, in the lumen of the glands and sometimes among the glandular epithelial cells in goslings of the respective groups, and could be reisolated from these organs by culturing. A mild inflammation of the intestinal mucosa was also noted. In transverse section of the brachyspirae, numerous (16-22) periplasmic flagella could be detected inside the outer sheath, also depending on the plane of section.

Hemagglutinating properties of Haemophilus paragallinarum serotype 2 and serotype C against freshly collected and glutaraldehyde (GA)- fixed chicken RBC were investigated. Different from serotype 1, the nontreated organisms of serotype 2 and serotype C lacked hemagglutinating activity. However, when the organisms were treated with potassium thiocyanate (KSCN) and/or sonication, activity occurred not only against GA-fixed chicken RBC, but also against GA-fixed RBC of various animal species. The maximum hemagglutination titer (1:64 to 1:256) was obtained against GA-fixed RBC with the KSCN-treated organisms that were also sonicated. The activity was inactivated by heating at 100 C or by treatments with formalin or trypsin, but not by treatments with hyaluronidase or neuraminidase. By using KSCN-treated and sonicated organisms and GA-fixed chicken RBC, a detection of hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibody was possible. The HI tests showed that serotype 2 hemagglutinin was immunologically distinct from serotype 1 and that the HI antibody correlated to protective activity against challenge exposure with serotype 2 and serotype C. Chicks having HI antibody greater than 1:5 were protected against challenge exposure with homologous type, but were not protected with serotype 1. Applicability of the HI test was also shown for evaluating protective potency in the serotype 2 vaccine, as well as in the serotype 1 vaccine.

Chlamydia psittaci is a zoonotic pathogen with a wide range of avian hosts and worldwide geographical spread. Zoonotic transfer occurs by inhalation or direct contact and may cause psittacosis or parrot disease. Host reservoirs of particular epidemiological interest include gregarious or migratory species, as colonial behavior facilitates microbial spread amongst conspecifics and a migratory ecology permits disperse over a wide geographic region. The current study detected C. psittaci antibodies in 76 of 81 (93.8%) feral Canada geese (Branta canadensis) using a species-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Viable C. psittaci were isolated from pharyngeal swabs of 47 of 81 (58%) birds, and subsequent ompA-based genotyping revealed genotypes E, B, and E/B. Absence of clinical symptoms in these geese could reflect a strong natural protection or a persistent infection. Canada geese are considered an important alien species in Europe. Current results denote that this avian reservoir poses a considerable risk to native wildlife as a potential source of C. psittaci.

The response of various species of Anser and Branta geese and other avian species to the ingestion of carbophenothion (S-[[(4-chlorophenyl)thio]methyl] O,O-diethyl phosphorodithioate) has been investigated. Optimum assay conditions for measurement of glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, glutamate dehydrogenase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, and cholinesterase in avian plasma were developed for the study. The administration of acutely toxic doses of carbophenothion to Japanese quail, pigeons, and chickens, and to Greylag, Pink-footed, Greenland White-fronted, and Canada geese led to species-dependent responses for both plasma glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase and cholinesterase levels. Carbophenothion administered to Japanese quail at several dose levels produced changes in plasma enzyme levels which were dependent on dose and time. The level of plasma glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase after dosing in the Anser family of geese rose more rapidly than in the Branta species but no change was found in this enzyme in either chickens or pigeons. In contrast to geese and pigeons, chickens exhibited no plasma cholinesterase inhibition for 3 hr after dosing. These enzyme changes demonstrate a species variation in the toxicological response of birds to a pesticide and indicate the desirability of using more than one avian species for pesticide toxicity testing.

We studied 7 influenza (H5N1) viruses isolated from poultry in western Siberia and the European part of the Russian Federation during July 2005-February 2006. Full genome sequences showed high homology to Qinghai-like influenza (H5N1) viruses. Phylogenetic analysis not only showed a close genetic relationship between the H5N1 strains isolated from poultry and wild migratory waterfowls but also suggested genetic reassortment among the analyzed isolates. Analysis of deduced amino acid sequences of the M2 and neuraminidase proteins showed that all isolates are potentially sensitive to currently available antiviral drugs. Pathogenicity testing showed that all studied viruses were highly pathogenic in chickens; for 3 isolates tested in mice and 2 tested in ferrets, pathogenicity was heterogeneous. Pathogenicity in mammalian models was generally correlated with Lys at residue 627 of polymerase basic protein 2.

Laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 ( LGP2: ) is a homologue of the retinoic acid inducible gene-I and melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 that lacks the caspase activation and recruitment domain required for signaling. It plays a pivotal role in host immune response. In this study, we cloned and characterized the full-length open reading frame ( ORF: ) sequence of LGP2 in the Qingyuan goose (Anser cygnoides) and evaluated the mRNA expression of this gene post infection with an H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus ( HPAIV: ). The full-length goose LGP2 ORF (2,028 bp) encoded a polypeptide of 675 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence contained 5 main overlapping structural domains-2 DEAD/DEAH box helicase domains, one conserved restriction domain of bacterial type III restriction enzyme, one helicase superfamily C-terminal domain and one C-terminal regulatory domain. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that goose LGP2 was constitutively expressed in all 19 investigated tissues, but the expression level was different among them. It was high expressed in the trachea, jejunum, bursa, kidney and heart, but low in the glandular stomach, lung, liver, spleen, crop and muscular stomach. A significant increase in the transcription of LGP2 was detected in the brain, spleen and lungs of geese post infection with H5N1 HPAIV versus uninfected tissues. These findings indicated that goose LGP2 was an important receptor that is involved in the host antiviral innate immune defense to H5N1 HPAIV in geese.

Malonyl coenzyme A (CoA) decarboxylase (E.C.4. 1.1.9) catalyzes the conversion of malonyl CoA to acetyl CoA. The metabolic role of malonyl CoA decarboxylase has not been fully defined, but deficiency of the enzyme has been associated with mild mental retardation, seizures, hypotonia, cardiomyopathy, vomiting, hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and malonic aciduria. Here we report the isolation and sequencing of the human gene encoding malonyl CoA decarboxylase, and the identification of a mutation causing malonyl CoA decarboxylase deficiency. Human malonyl CoA decarboxylase cDNA sequences were identified by homology to the goose gene, and the intron/exon boundaries were determined by direct sequencing of a PAC clone containing the entire human gene. The 1479 basepair human cDNA is 70 percent identical to the goose sequence, and the intron/exon boundaries are completely conserved between the two species. The genetic mutation underlying malonyl CoA decarboxylase deficiency was determined in a patient with clinical features of this defect, malonic aciduria, and markedly reduced malonyl CoA decarboxylase activity.

In 2011, avian influenza surveillance at the Bangladesh live bird markets (LBMs) showed complete replacement of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus of clade 2.2.2 (Qinghai-like H5N1 lineage) by the HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.2.1. This clade, which continues to circulate in Bangladesh and neighboring countries, is an intra-and interclade reassortant; its HA, polymerase basic 1 (PB1), polymerase (PA), and nonstructural (NS) genes come from subclade 2.3.2.1a; the polymerase basic 2 (PB2) comes from subclade 2.3.2.1c; and the NA, nucleocapsid protein (NP), and matrix (M) gene from clade 2.3.4.2. The H9N2 influenza viruses cocirculating in the Bangladesh LBMs are also reassortants, possessing five genes (NS, M, NP, PA, and PB1) from an HPAI H7N3 virus previously isolated in Pakistan. Despite frequent coinfection of chickens and ducks, reassortment between these H5N1 and H9N2 viruses has been rare. However, all such reassortants detected in 2011 through 2013 have carried seven genes from the local HPAI H5N1 lineage and the PB1 gene from the Bangladeshi H9N2 clade G1 Mideast, itself derived from HPAI H7N3 virus. Although the live birds we sampled in Bangladesh showed no clinical signs of morbidity, the emergence of this reassortant HPAI H5N1 lineage further complicates endemic circulation of H5N1 viruses in Bangladesh, posing a threat to both poultry and humans.

The antidotal efficacy of pralidoxime iodide and obidoxime dichloride was investigated in goslings poisoned by a supralethal dose of the organophosphorus insecticide diazinon. Various doses of both drugs were administered by intramuscular injection when the poisoned birds were unable to walk. Pralidoxime at 100 mg/kg brought about a complete and speedy clinical recovery. Fifty mg/kg induced recovery in 4 of 6 poisoned goslings, and 25 mg/kg successfully trated only 1 of 6 birds. Obidoxime at 25 mg/kg showed no therapeutic properties whereas 50 and 100 mg/kg delayed the death of some birds by several hours. At 100 mg/kg, all goslings had transient signs of intoxication, which precluded the use of this compound as an antidote at higher doses. The mode of action of these antidotes in diazinon-poisoned goslings is discussed.

An epizootic of duck plague occurred in early 1973 in a population of 163,500 wild waterfowl, primarily mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), wintering on Lake Andes and the nearby Missouri River in southeastern South Dakota (USA). The diagnosis was based on pathologic lesions and confirmed by virus isolation. Control measures included quarantine, attempts to reduce virus contamination of the area, dispersal of waterfowl, and monitoring of wild waterfowl populations for mortality. The epizootic resulted in documented mortality of 18% and estimated mortality of 26% of the waterfowl at risk. Prompt implementation of control measures might have limited mortality to approximately 8%. Losses during the epizootic were equivalent to 0.12% of the annual mortality in the North American 1996 fall population of 80,000,000 wild ducks. The most likely sources of the infection were free-flying wild mallard or American black duck (Anas rubripes) carriers from the upper midwestern or northeastern United States. Duck plague serum neutralization antibodies were demonstrated in 31% of 395 apparently healthy mallards sampled prior to dispersal of the flock at Lake Andes, suggesting that tens of thousands of potential duck plague carriers entered the wild waterfowl populations of all four major flyways. Consequently, the absence of major epizootics of duck plague in wild waterfowl in the subsequent two decades is evidence that substantial numbers of duck plague carriers can occur in wild waterfowl populations without resulting in epizootic mortalities. The failure to isolate duck plague virus from apparently healthy mallards sampled during the epizootic raises questions concerning the validity of conclusions regarding the status of duck plague in wild waterfowl based upon negative results of random surveys conducted in the absence of epizootics.

Tick borne encephalitis (TBE), is endemic in several countries in central and northern Europe, in the Baltic states and in Russia. Vaccination has been shown to lower efficiently the number of cases of this potentially very serious disease. However, the possibility to assess the neutralizing antibody response after clinical disease or vaccination has been hampered by the lack of easy and specific tests. We developed a rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT) and compared it with a standard plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and an hemagglutination inhibition test (HI) for antibody detection in late convalescent sera from 18 patients with a previous clinical and serological diagnosis of TBE. Neutralizing titres obtained with RFFIT were almost identical to those obtained with PRNT, and correlated also well with the HI results. The RFFIT for detection of neutralizing antibodies to TBE-virus has an advantage over the standard PRNT in its easy and rapid performance (results are obtained in 1 vs 7 days), and over the HI in its specificity, since cross-reactions with other flaviviruses are minimized.

Multiplex PCR analyses of DNAs from genotypically unique Escherichia coli strains isolated from the feces of 138 humans and 376 domesticated animals from Jeonnam Province, South Korea, performed using primers specific for the chuA and yjaA genes and an unknown DNA fragment, TSPE4.C2, indicated that none of the strains belonged to E. coli phylogenetic group B2. In contrast, phylogenetic group B2 strains were detected in about 17% (8 of 48) of isolates from feces of 24 wild geese and in 3% (3 of 96) of isolates obtained from the Yeongsan River in Jeonnam Province, South Korea. The distribution of E. coli strains in phylogenetic groups A, B1, and D varied depending on the host examined, and there was no apparent seasonal variation in the distribution of strains in phylogenetic groups among the Yeongsan River isolates. The distribution of four virulence genes (eaeA, hlyA, stx(1), and stx(2)) in isolates was also examined by using multiplex PCR. Virulence genes were detected in about 5% (38 of 707) of the total group of unique strains examined, with 24, 13, 13, and 9 strains containing hlyA, eaeA, stx(2), and stx(1), respectively. The virulence genes were most frequently present in phylogenetic group B1 strains isolated from beef cattle. Taken together, results of these studies indicate that E. coli strains in phylogenetic group B2 were rarely found in humans and domesticated animals in Jeonnam Province, South Korea, and that the majority of strains containing virulence genes belonged to phylogenetic group B1 and were isolated from beef cattle. Results of this study also suggest that the relationship between the presence and types of virulence genes and phylogenetic groupings may differ among geographically distinct E. coli populations.

In British Columbia, Canada, drinking water is tested for total coliforms and Escherichia coli, but there is currently no routine follow-up testing to investigate fecal contamination sources in samples that test positive for indicator bacteria. Reliable microbial source tracking (MST) tools to rapidly test water samples for multiple fecal contamination markers simultaneously are currently lacking. The objectives of this study were (i) to develop a qualitative MST tool to identify fecal contamination from different host groups, and (ii) to evaluate the MST tool using water samples with evidence of fecal contamination. Singleplex and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to test (i) water from polluted sites and (ii) raw and drinking water samples for presence of bacterial genetic markers associated with feces from humans, cattle, seagulls, pigs, chickens, and geese. The multiplex MST assay correctly identified suspected contamination sources in contaminated waterways, demonstrating that this test may have utility for heavily contaminated sites. Most raw and drinking water samples analyzed using singleplex PCR contained at least one host-associated marker. Singleplex PCR was capable of detecting host-associated markers in small sample volumes and is therefore a promising tool to further analyze water samples submitted for routine testing and provide information useful for water quality management.

Salmonella cultures were obtained from outbreaks of animal disease from 37 states and 1 territory. They were screened for resistance to 11 antimicrobial drugs. Of the 1,251 strains studied, 935 were resistant to one or more of these agents. The three most common resistance patterns were ampicillin, dihydrostreptomycin, sulfamethoxypyridazine, tetracycline; ampicillin, dihydrostreptomycin, sulfamethoxypyridazine; dihydrostreptomycin, sulfamethoxypyridazine, tetracycline. Resistance transfer was demonstrated on 267 multiply resistant cultures, of which 181 were able to transfer all or part of their resistance pattern to a drug-sensitive recipient.

Genotype VII Newcastle disease virus (NDV) has been documented as the predominant epidemic genotype in China and some other Asian countries since 1990s. Recent work has demonstrated that NDV vaccines phylogenetically closer to epidemic viruses provide better protection than conventional vaccines in terms of reducing virus shedding and transmission. Since there is currently no available vaccine which possesses a close antigenic relationship to the prevalent virulent NDV, a new vaccine to protect against the infection of this genotype NDV is in urgent need. Here, we describe the generation of a pathogenicity-attenuated genotype VII NDV (NDV/ZJ1HN) from a velogenic NDV by mutating the velogenic amino acid motif at the F protein cleavage site using reverse genetics techniques. The attenuated-pathogenicity of NDV/ZJ1HN was confirmed by examination of mean death time (MDT) in embryonated eggs and intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) in day-old chickens. Subsequently, 2 weeks old birds were immunized with live and inactivated NDV/ZJ1HN-based vaccines and challenged 3 or 4 weeks post-immunization with a lethal dose of a virulent genotype VII NDV strain. Results showed that NDV/ZJ1HN effectively protected the vaccinated birds from morbidity and mortality against genotype VII virus challenge and significantly reduced virus shedding from the vaccinated birds when compared with La Sota vaccinated animals, suggesting that NDV/ZJ1HN is a promising vaccine candidate for the control of current ND epidemic in China.

The TaqMan® real-time PCR assay using the mitochondrial D-loop region was developed for the quantitative detection of pork in processed meat products. The newly designed primers and probe specifically amplified pork without any cross-reactivity with non-target animal species. The limit of detection of the real-time PCR assay was 0.1pg of heat-treated pork meat and 0.1% (w/w) pork meat in beef and chicken meat mixtures. The quantitative real-time PCR assay was applied to analyze the pork meat content in 22 commercial processed meat products including jerkies, press hams, sausages, hamburger patties and steaks, grilled short rib patties, and nuggets. The developed real-time PCR method was able to detect pork meat in various types of processed meat products that declared the use of pork meat on their label. All processed meat products that declared no use of pork meat showed a negative result in the assay. The method developed in this study showed sensitivity and specificity in the quantification of pork meat in commercial processed meat products.

Zearalenone (ZEA), a widely distributed oestrogenic fusariotoxin, constitutes a potential risk for human and animal health. ZEA is metabolised to the main metabolites identified in vitro and in vivo: alpha-zearalenol (alpha-ZOL) and beta-zearalenol (beta-ZOL). The efficiency to produce alpha-reduced metabolites appears of particular interest in risk assessment as alpha-reduced metabolites constitute activated forms whereas beta-reduced metabolites are less oestrogenic than ZEA. In this study ZEA activation was compared in avian food species. ZEA and its reduced metabolites were quantified in subcellular fractions of six avian species and rat livers. The alpha-ZOL/beta-ZOL ratio in rats was 19. The various avian food species cannot be considered to be equivalent in terms of ZEA reduction (P<0.001). Quails represented high "beta reducers", with alpha-ZOL/beta-ZOL ratio less than two. Weak "beta reducers" included on one part ducks and chickens showing alpha-ZOL/beta-ZOL ratio greater than 3 and up to 5.6 and on a second part geese, showing a lower production of alpha-ZOL than other poultry. Comparisons of enzyme kinetics in ducks and in quails show that these variations can be explained by the action of various isoforms of dehydrogenases. These results are relevant to food safety, in the context of frequently inevitable contamination of animal feed.

We investigated the gut-kidney interaction in goslings with gout and tried to decipher the probable mechanisms through which gut dysbiosis leads to the progression of renal injury and inflammation. A total of 15 goslings (Anser cygnoides), with typical visceral gout symptoms, were screened and compared with 15 healthy goslings. We determined the signatures of the microbiome in the cecum chyme of goslings in the 2 groups by 16S sequencing, and analyzed the changes in intestinal permeability, levels of serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the induced inflammatory response of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). We found the existence of gut dysbiosis in goslings with gout as a result of interactions among the multitude of bacteria present in the gut, and the proliferation of a specific pathogenic genus, Proteobacteria, played a decisive role in this process. Moreover, the permeability increased not only in the intestinal epithelium but also in the renal endothelium, providing possibilities for gut-derived LPS to enter the blood circulation and damage the kidneys. The systemic LPS concentration was increased in the gout group and exhibited a positive correlation with the degree of renal injury. In addition, we also found that inflammatory disorders concurrently existed in the gut and kidney of goslings with gout, and the LPS/TLR4/MyD88 (Myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88) inflammatory signaling was activated. These results indicate that the loss of intestinal barrier as a result of gut dysbiosis causes the translocation of gut-derived LPS, which can play an important role in the development of gout in goslings through interference with kidney functions.

Four waterfowl were collected in the Tri-State Mining District (Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri, USA), an area known to be contaminated with lead, cadmium and zinc (Zn). They were part of a larger group of 20 waterfowl collected to determine the exposure of birds to metal contamination at the site. The four waterfowl (three Branta canadensis, one Anas platyrhynchos) had mild to severe degenerative abnormalities of the exocrine pancreas, as well as tissue (pancreas, liver) concentrations of Zn that were considered toxic. The mildest condition was characterized by generalized atrophy of exocrine cells that exhibited cytoplasmic vacuoles and a relative lack of zymogen. The most severe condition was characterized by acini with distended lumens and hyperplastic exocrine tissue that completely lacked zymogen; these acini were widely separated by immature fibrous tissue. Because the lesions were nearly identical to the lesions reported in chickens and captive waterfowl that had been poisoned with ingested Zn, and because the concentrations of Zn in the pancreas and liver of the four birds were consistent with the concentrations measured in Zn-poisoned birds, we concluded that these waterfowl were poisoned by Zn. This may be the first reported case of zinc poisoning in free-ranging wild birds poisoned by environmental Zn.

West Nile virus activity in Manitoba was documented for the first time by the collection of an infected crow found on July 8, 2002, in Winnipeg. West Nile virus was identified as the cause of death for a large number of domestic geese at a single farm in southern Manitoba in August. Of the 5 differently aged cohorts on the affected farm, which included 2 breeding flocks and 3 growing flocks, the 6-week-old cohort was most severely affected with 692 of 2731 goslings dying within a 10-day period. Seroprevalence of West Nile virus in 2 clinically affected and recovered juvenile cohorts was 98% and 100%. In breeding geese without clinical disease, seroprevalence was 90% for 15-month-old birds and 10% for 5-year-old birds. Seroreaction in 3 of 4 cohorts tested exceeded what would be expected by mosquito transmission alone.

The purpose of the present investigation is to compare the ability of chickens, ducks and geese to digest and utilise a diet containing a relatively large amount of barley (40%) rich in beta-glucan (18 g kg(-1)) and NSP (137 g kg(-1)) of which 35 g kg(-1) were soluble non-starch polysaccharides (NSP). The diets were offered to the birds (50 chickens, 40 ducks and 30 geese) in the period from hatching to 42 days of age. The digestibility of NSP was measured during the last week of the growth period using chromic oxide as an indigestible marker. Emphasis was on total NSP, soluble and insoluble NSP and their constituent sugar residues (rhamnose, fucose, arabinose, xylose, mannose, galactose, glucose and glucuronic acid). The degradation of NSP to short chain fatty acids (SCFA) was determined in the small intestine, caeca and large intestine. Although significant differences were found between species to the extent of degradation of individual soluble, insoluble and total NSP residues in the small intestine and caeca, the overall apparent digestibility of total NSP was similar (39-42%). On the basis of the digestibility of the NSP sugar residues and the formation of SCFA in the gut, the energy value of NSP was estimated on 2.8, 3.2 and 2.7 kJ g(-1) NSP ingested (P>0.05) in chickens, ducks and geese, respectively. On average, NSP contributed approximately 3.5% of metabolisable energy (ME) in the three poultry species.

Following the isolation in 1997 of West Nile virus from the brains of geese with an acute neuroparalytic disease in Israel, which reappeared in the following years, an inactivated vaccine was prepared from suckling mouse brains. The brain homogenate was inactivated with formaldehyde and blended with mineral oil adjuvant. In 2000, the first flocks were vaccinated according to a schedule of two subcutaneous doses, commencing at the age of 2 weeks and given with a 2-weeks interval. In efficacy trials, the challenge virus was injected at 7 weeks by the intracranial route, and over 85% protection was recorded in vaccinated geese. In extensive field trials conducted in 2001--2003, the vaccine was demonstrated to be safe and efficacious, and over 3 million doses were manufactured in 2000--2003.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize components of pathogens and mediate the host innate immune response. TLR21 is a TLR that specifically recognizes exogenous double-stranded DNA and rapidly signals to downstream innate immune factors. This study reports the cDNA of goose TLR21 and identifies its immune characteristics. The goose TLR21 is 3161 base pairs and encodes a 975 amino acid protein. As predicted, the goose transmembrane protein TLR21 has a signal peptide, leucine-rich repeat regions, a transmembrane domain, and a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain. Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses showed that goose TLR21 has homology to chicken TLR21. The tissue distribution of TLR21 suggested that it has high transcript levels in immune-associated tissues, especially in the bursa of Fabricius, the Hadrian gland, and the thymus. After challenge with agonist ODN2006 and new type gosling viral enteritis virus (NGVEV), significant induction of TLR21 production, pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6, and interferons were observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Both synthetic DNA (ODN2006) and viral DNA (NGVEV) can be recognized by goose TLR21, which leads to a rapid up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and anti-viral molecules. In vivo, avian influenza A virus H9N2 and NGVEV were used to infect goslings, which was followed by a significant up-regulation of TLR21 mRNA transcripts in multiple tissues of NGVEV-infected geese. In general, goose TLR21 plays an important role in binding invading pathogenic DNA viruses, which subsequently triggers an innate immune response; furthermore, it acts as a functional homologue of mammalian TLR9, as TLR21 recognizes a mammalian TLR9 agonist.

H7N9 subtype avian influenza viruses (AIV) circulating in China over recent years have had an enormous impact on public health and economy. During the period between November 2016 and April 2017, an increase in human infections caused by these viruses was reported, with rapid emergence and spread of variants in China. Consequently, the government of China implemented a controversial vaccination strategy in September 2017. Here, we provide evidence of the prevalence of H7N9 AIVs in China based on systematic large-scale surveillance in poultry during 2013-2018. Emerging variants were confirmed as highly pathogenic in chickens using the intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) test. The currently available vaccine provided complete protection against the H7N9 HPAIV challenge in chickens. The collective findings clearly indicate that the vaccination strategy implemented not only significantly decreases the prevalence of H7N9 AIVs in poultry but also effectively prevents human infection with H7N9 viruses.

The continuing westward spread of avian influenza A virus of the subtype H5N1 in free-living and domestic birds forced the European Union and the German federal government to enhance all biosecurity measures including in-house keeping of all captive birds from October 20 to December 15, 2005. Movement of captive ducks and geese of many different species from a free-range system to tight enclosures and maintenance for prolonged times in such overcrowded sheds resulted in pronounced disturbance of natural behaviour, interruption of mating and breeding activities and possibly additional stress. Under these conditions the birds developed signs of severe disease and enhanced mortality twentyfour days later. A total of 17 out of 124 (14%) adult birds and 149 out of 184 year-old birds (81 %) died during the outbreak. A herpesvirus was isolated from many organs of succumbed ducks and geese that was identified as a duck plague herpesvirus by cross neutralization test using known antisera against duck plague virus. The published host range of duck plague comprises 34 species within the order Anseriformes. We report here on additional 14 species of this order that were found to be susceptible to duck plague virus. The exact source of the herpesvirus could not identified. However, low antibody titres in some ducks at day of vaccination indicate that at least some of the birds were latently infected with a duck plague herpesvirus. The remaining healthy appearing birds were subcutaneously vaccinated with a modified live duck plague vaccine (Intervet, Boxmeer, NL) that stopped losses and resulted in seroconversion in most of the vaccinated birds.

To investigate how cholesterol induces hepatocytic steatosis, we investigated the effect of cholesterol on hepatic lipogenesis and the assembly and secretion of very-low-density lipoprotein-triglycerides (VLDL-TGs) in goose primary hepatocytes. We found that cholesterol at 20 μg/ml increased the concentrations of extracellular VLDL, intracellular cholesterol, and intracellular TGs, while cholesterol at 30 μg/ml had a reduced effect (p < 0.05). Additionally, cholesterol at 20 μg/ml, but not at 10 or 30 μg/ml, increased the extracellular TG concentration. Cholesterol increased the fatty acid synthase (FAS) enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner. Incubation with cholesterol increased the mRNA level of genes involved in lipogenesis, including sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), FAS, acetyl-CoA carboxylase-α (ACCα), and liver X receptors. The mRNA level of the acyl-CoA: diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) gene changed in response to cholesterol treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Similar to the regulation of extracellular VLDL and intracellular TG accumulation, the mRNA levels of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, forkhead box O1, and DGAT2 increased with treatment with 10 or 20 μg/ml of cholesterol, but decreased with treatment with 30 μg/ml of cholesterol (p < 0.05). Cholesterol had no evident effect on the mRNA level of the apolipoprotein B gene. Incubation with cholesterol at 20 and 30 μg/ml increased the nuclear SREBP-1 protein level (p < 0.05) and the binding affinity of the nuclear SREBP-1 to ACCα SRE probes. In conclusion, cholesterol not only activates the transcription of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis and TG accumulation, but also activates the transcription of genes involved in the assembly and secretion of VLDL-TG in goose primary hepatocytes.

Duck virus enteritis is an acute contagious viral disease affecting birds of the order Anseriformes (ducks, geese and swans). The disease agent is a member of the Herpesviridae family (Anatidae herpes virus 1). A group of Anseriformes waterfowl from a Nature Reserve and Centre for the Recovery of Endangered Species in Spain suffered an outbreak of the disease, affecting adults, young and newborns. Other non-Anseriformes waterfowl such as coots, from the family Rallidae, order Gruiformes, were also affected. Histopathological and ultrastructural findings confirmed the viral infection. The present study provides evidence that birds different from the order Anseriformes can be affected, suggesting that the virus has the ability to infest other non-Anseriformes waterfows.

The functional significance of granule enzymes in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) is not fully understood because of the multiplicity of the enzymes and the rare occurrence of deficiencies in man. In order to select appropriate laboratory animals for functional studies, a phylogenetic comparison of enzyme levels in animal and human PMN was undertaken. Neutrophils were obtained from a variety of laboratory animals and man; the activities of alkaline phosphatase, lysozyme, myeloperoxidase, and beta-glucuronidase were determined by histochemical and analytical techniques. Marked interspecies differences in enzyme activity were found; many species were deficient in alkaline phosphatase or lysozyme. Differences in pH optima and metal requirements of alkaline phosphatase were not of sufficient magnitude to explain the variations of this enzyme.

To determine if lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) are a potential reservoir for the Pasteurella multocida bacterium that causes avian cholera, serum samples and/or pharyngeal swabs were collected from > 3,400 adult geese breeding on Wrangel Island (Russia) and Banks Island (Canada) during 1993-1996. Pharyngeal swab sampling rarely (> 0.1%) detected birds that were exposed to P. multocida in these populations. Geese with serum antibody levels indicating recent infection with P. multocida were found at both breeding colonies. Prevalence of seropositive birds was 3.5% at Wrangel Island, an area that has no recorded history of avian cholera epizootics. Prevalence of seropositive birds was 2.8% at Banks Island in 1994, but increased to 8.2% during 1995 and 1996 when an estimated 40,000-60,000 snow geese were infected. Approximately 50% of the infected birds died during the epizootic and a portion of the surviving birds may have become carriers of the disease. This pattern of prevalence indicated that enzootic levels of infection with P. multocida occurred at both breeding colonies. When no avian cholera epizootics occurred (Wrangel Island, Banks Island in 1994), female snow geese (4.7%) had higher antibody prevalence than males (2.0%).

The strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) can be divided into two distinct clades: class I and class II. At present, limited molecular epidemiological data are available for the class I virus at live bird markets (LBMs). Knowing the genomic and antigenic characteristics of class I NDVs might provide important insights into the evolution dynamics of these viruses. In this study class I NDVs isolated from LBMs in Eastern China between 2008 and 2012 were characterized.

Melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 (MDA5) and retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) selectively sense cytoplasmic viral RNA to induce an antiviral immune response. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is one of the most important infectious agents in chickens, and in chicken cells, it can be recognized by MDA5 to activate interferon production. RIG-I is considered to be absent in chickens. However, the absence of RIG-I in chickens raises the question of whether this protein influences the antiviral immune response against IBV infection.

Poultry species--chickens, ducks, geese--are becoming increasingly popular as pets. As such, requests for accurate diagnoses and treatment are being received by the veterinary community from the public. Unlike the food animal and production-oriented aspects of poultry medicine, success with these pet birds is contingent on preserving the human-pet bird bond, as defined by the individual client. This article presents some of this author's observations in diagnostic profiles on some selected disorders of backyard poultry.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) can cause devastating losses in the poultry industry. In addition, several HPAIV exhibit a zooanthroponotic potential and can cause fatal infections in humans. These attributes particularly apply to HPAIV H5N1 of Asian origin. Due to the absence of overt clinical symptoms, introduction and subsequent spread of HPAIV H5N1 in domestic waterfowl (especially ducks) may occur undetected, which increases the risk of transspecies transmissions to highly vulnerable gallinaceous poultry and mammals, including humans. Humans may also become infected with HPAIV H5N1 by food products from slaughtered, silently infected ducks. Vaccination against HPAIV can raise a protective barrier against an incursion of HPAIV since, at least under experimental conditions, the reproduction factor R0 lowered to <1, which ensures eradication of the virus. The objective of this study was to analyse whether these results can also be obtained under free-ranging field conditions in commercially reared flocks of goose parents and fattening ducks injected with a licensed, adjuvanted inactivated H5N2 vaccine. The time and labour required for the vaccination of these geese and duck flocks exceeded expected values, mainly due to animal sorting according to foot ring labels. No adverse effects directly associated with vaccination were observed. Serologically, a homogenous H5-specific antibody response was induced. Titres varied with temporal distance from the last application of vaccine. Geese parents were clinically protected against challenge with HPAIV A/Cygnus cygnus/Germany/R65/06 (H5N1), but still could be infected and spread HPAIV H5N1, albeit at lower levels and for shorter periods compared to unvaccinated controls. Fattening Pekin ducks proved to be clinically resistant against challenge virus infection and shed very little virus.

Spermine synthase (SPMS), which converts spermidine into spermine, is essential for normal cell growth and development processes in humans and other mammals, but the molecular characterization and expression profiling of the SPMS gene remain undetermined in goose tissues and ovarian follicles. In this study, the SPMS cDNA sequence of the Sichuan white goose was cloned and analysed, and SPMS mRNA expression was profiled in various tissues and ovarian follicles. The results showed that the open reading frame of the SPMS cDNA sequence was 1092 bp in length, encoding 363 amino acids with a molecular weight of 41 kDa. Among all the examined tissues, SPMS expression was highest in the spleen and cerebrum and lowest in the breast and thigh muscles. SPMS expression in the F1 follicle was significantly higher than that in the POF (except for POF2) (P < 0.05). Our results indicate that SPMS might play an important role in follicular development and ovulation.

Mitochondrion, the power house of the cell, is an important organelle involving in energy homeostasis. Change in mitochondrial mass and function may lead to metabolic disorders. Previous studies indicate that mitochondrial mass loss and dysfunction are associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in human and mouse. However, it is unclear whether mitochondrial genes are involved in the development of goose fatty liver. To address this, we determined the response of goose mitochondrial genes to overfeeding and other fatty liver-related factors (e.g., hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia). We first employed RNA-seq technology to determine the differentially expressed genes in the livers from normally-fed vs. overfed geese, followed by bioinformatics analysis and quantitative PCR validation. Data indicated that a majority of mitochondrial genes in the liver were induced by overfeeding. To understand how these genes are regulated in the context of fatty liver, we treated goose primary hepatocytes with high levels of glucose, fatty acids and insulin. The results indicated that these factors had an influence on the expression of some mitochondria related genes. Together, these findings suggest that the induction of mitochondrial gene expression by overfeeding is required for the development of goose fatty liver, and this induction is partially attributable to hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and hyperinsulinemia.

The toxic effects associated with rapid lipid mobilization and a high plasma free fatty acid (FFA) concentration produced by glucagon were evaluated. Glucagon (0.5 mg/kg of body wt) was injected intravenously into nonfasting geese. The geese developed rapid respirations and high plasma FFA levels within 15 min after the glucagon injection; three of eleven died. Control geese, injected with saline, did not exhibit toxic signs. Peak FFA concentrations developed 15 min after glucagon and high levels persisted for over 90 min. Geese injected with glucagon frequently developed electrocardiographic abnormalities that included supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and signs of myocardial ischemia. Light and electron microscopy revealed acute myocardial degeneration and fatty infiltration of the liver. The increase in plasma FFA concentrations and toxic effects were not prevented by pretreatment with nicotinic acid or propranolol.

The major capsid protein VP2 of goose parvovirus (GPV) expressed using a baculovirus expression system (BES) assembles into virus-like particles (VLPs). To optimize VP2 gene expression in Sf9 cells, we converted wild-type VP2 (VP2) codons into codons that are more common in insect genes. This change greatly increased VP2 protein production in Sf9 cells. The protein generated from the codon-optimized VP2 (optVP2) was detected by immunoblotting and an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed the formation of VLPs. These findings indicate that optVP2 yielded stable and high-quality VLPs. Immunogenicity assays revealed that the VLPs are highly immunogenic, elicit a high level of neutralizing antibodies and provide protection against lethal challenge. The antibody levels appeared to be directly related to the number of GP-Ag-positive hepatocytes. The variation trends for GP-Ag-positive hepatocytes were similar in the vaccine groups. In comparison with the control group, the optVP2 VLPs groups exhibited obviously better responses. These data indicate that the VLPs retained immunoreactivity and had strong immunogenicity in susceptible geese. Thus, GPV optVP2 appears to be a good candidate for the vaccination of goslings.

Isolation of fetal cells from maternal circulation is the subject of intense research to eliminate the need for currently used invasive prenatal diagnosis procedures. Fetal cells can be isolated using magnetic-activated cell sorting or fluorescence-activated cell sorting, however no technique to specifically isolate and use fetal cells for genetic diagnosis has reached routine clinical practice. This paper demonstrates the use of a micromachined device to separate fetal cells from maternal circulation based on differences in size and deformation characteristics. Nucleated fetal red blood cells range in diameter from 9 to 12 microm can deform and pass through a channel as small as 2.5 microm wide and 5 microm deep. Although the white blood cells range in diameter from 10 to 20 microm, they cannot deform and are retained by the 2.5 microm wide and 5 microm deep channels under our experimental conditions. Fetal cells were isolated from cord blood and DNA analysis confirmed their fetal origin with ruled out maternal contamination.

Antimicrobial resistance against colistin has emerged worldwide and is threatening the efficacy of colistin treatment of multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. In this study, PCRs were used to detect mcr genes (mcr-1, mcr-2, mcr-3) in 213 anal and 1,339 nasal swabs from pigs (n = 1,454) in nine provinces of China, and 1,696 cloacal and 1,647 oropharyngeal samples from poultry (n = 1,836) at live-bird markets in 24 provinces. The mcr-1 prevalences in pigs (79.2%) and geese (71.7%) were significantly higher than in chickens (31.8%), ducks (34.6%) and pigeons (13.1%). The mcr-2 prevalence in pigs was 56.3%, significantly higher than in chickens (5.5%), ducks (2.3%), geese (5.5%) and pigeons (0%). The mcr-3 prevalences in pigs (18.7%), ducks (13.8%) and geese (11.9%) were significantly higher than in chickens (5.2%) and pigeons (5.1%). In total, 173 pigs and three chickens were positive for all three mcr genes. The prevalences of the mcr were significantly higher in nasal/oropharyngeal swabs than in the anal /cloacal swabs. Phylogenetic studies identified 33 new mcr-2 variants and 12 new mcr-3 variants. This study demonstrates high prevalences of mcr in pigs and poultry in China, and indicates there is need for more thorough surveillance and control programs to prevent further selection of colistin resistance.

Outbreaks of Newcastle disease in flocks of geese with high morbidity and mortality in southern and eastern China have been reported frequently since the late 1990s, which broke the traditional view that geese are considered to be the natural reservoir of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) but show few or no clinical signs after infection. In this present study, geese were infected intranasally with a local strain of NDV. Clinical disease and gross pathology were observed. Serum and immune organs were collected from geese sequentially euthanized or after disease-associated death. We studied the histopathology of immune organs by haematoxylin and eosin staining and NDV fusion protein was detected in tissues by immunohistochemistry. At the same time, the SYBR Green I real-time polymerase chain reaction assay was used to detect the viral load from the collected samples. Serum samples were tested for NDV-specific antibodies and avian influenza virus (AIV)-specific antibodies by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. The results showed that severe lesions and numerous positive reactions of NDV antigen were detected in the immune organs. High viral loads developed in immune organs of infected geese, correlating with the severity of clinical signs and lesions in the tissues. Furthermore, the infected geese developed low HI antibody titres to both AIV and NDV. The present study showed that the replication and dissemination of the NDV isolate was widespread in immune organs of geese. The study revealed that waterfowl may not only be a natural reservoir of NDV but also become susceptible to disease and may play a major role in the epidemiology of Newcastle disease.

Waterfowl play a key role in the epidemiology of the H5N1 subtype of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus; therefore, efficient immunization of domesticated ducks and geese to maximize the impact of other control measures is of great importance. A recombinant (r)HVT-AI, expressing the HA gene of a clade 2.2 H5N1 HPAI strain had been developed and proved to be efficient against different clades of H5N1 HPAI virus in chickens after a single vaccination at 1 day old and could provide long-term immunity. We investigated whether rHVT-AI applied at 1 day old is able to replicate in different species and crossbreeds of ducks and in geese with the aim of collecting data on the possible application of rHVT-AI vaccine in different species of waterfowl for the control of H5N1 HPAI. We tested the possible differences among different waterfowl species, i.e., between geese (Anser anser, domesticated greylag goose), Muscovy ducks (Cairina moschata forma domestica), Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos forma domestica), and mule ducks (Muscovy duck × Pekin duck), in their susceptibility to support the replication of rHVT-AI. Vaccine virus replication was followed by real-time PCR in spleen, bursa, and feather tip samples. Humoral immune response to vaccination was tested using the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test and H5-specific commercial ELISA. Significant differences among the different waterfowl species regarding the rate of rHVT-AI replication was detected that were not reflected by the same difference in the immune response to vaccination. Replication of the rHVT-AI vaccine was very limited in Pekin ducks, somewhat better in mule ducks, and the vaccine virus was replicating significantly better in Muscovy ducks and geese, reaching 100% detectability at certain time points after administration at 1 day old. Results indicated that the vaccine virus could establish different levels of persistent infection in these species of waterfowl. No humoral immune response could be detected either by HI test or ELISA during the tested postvaccination period (5 wk).

PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway is associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. However, it is not clear how this signaling pathway affects the ER stress. The present study aimed to determine whether the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway regulates tunicamycin (TM)-induced increases in mRNA levels of genes involved in the ER stress, to help elucidate the mechanism by which this pathway affects the ER stress in primary goose hepatocytes. Primary hepatocytes were isolated from geese and cultured in vitro. After 12 h in a serum-free medium, the hepatocytes were incubated for 24 h in a medium with either no addition (control) or with supplementation of TM or TM together with PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway inhibitors (LY294002, rapamycin, NVP-BEZ235). Thereafter, the expression levels of genes involved in the ER stress (BIP, EIF2a, ATF6, and XBP1) were assessed. The results indicated that the mRNA level of BIP was up-regulated in 0.2, 2, and 20 μM TM treatment group (P < 0.05), whereas the mRNA levels of EIF2a, ATF6, and XBP1 were up-regulated in the 2 μM TM treatment group (P < 0.05). However, the TM mediated induction of mRNA levels of genes involved in the ER stress (BIP, EIF2a, ATF6, and XBP1) was down-regulated after the treatment with PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway inhibitors (LY294002, NVP-BEZ235, and rapamycin). Therefore, our results strongly suggest that the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway might be involved in the down-regulation of the TM-induced ER stress in primary goose hepatocytes.

During arbovirus surveillance in Ixodes ricinus ticks in South Ukraine, two strains of Tribeč virus were isolated using an in vivo method and characterized using the complement fixation text (CFT), hemagglutination assay (HA), electron microscopy, and molecular methods. Both strains replicated well in the BHK-21, PEC, and Vero cell lines and demonstrated 95% nucleotide identity in their VP3 sequences compared with the reference VP3 sequence for Tribeč virus. These two strains of Tribeč virus were named Tr35 and Tr19. Also, segment reassortment involving Tr35, Tr19, TRBV, and LIPV strains was shown.

In Bangladesh, little is known about the genomic composition and antigenicity of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses, their geographic distribution, temporal patterns, or gene flow within the avian host population. Forty highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses isolated from humans and poultry in Bangladesh between 2008 and 2012 were analyzed by full genome sequencing and antigenic characterization. The analysis included viruses collected from avian hosts and environmental sampling in live bird markets, backyard poultry flocks, outbreak investigations in wild birds or poultry and from three human cases. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the ancestors of these viruses reassorted (1) with other gene lineages of the same clade, (2) between different clades and (3) with low pathogenicity avian influenza A virus subtypes. Bayesian estimates of the time of most recent common ancestry, combined with geographic information, provided evidence of probable routes and timelines of virus spread into and out of Bangladesh.

The H9N2 influenza virus is endemic in poultry. We report its occurrence in live-poultry markets, fair-trade markets and poultry farms in the Shanghai region between September 2006 and December 2010. An analysis of partial sequences of the HA, NA, PB1, PB2 and NP genes of eleven distinct H9N2 isolates revealed that all carried an RSSR motif at the cleavage site of HA, diagnostic of low pathogenicity in chickens. A phylogenetic analysis indicated that these isolates are derived from the lineage represented by Duck/HK/Y280/97, but they have evolved a range of reassortments. Their PB1 and NP sequences resembled those of H5N1 strains, indicating a hybrid origin involving both H9 and H5 strains. The HA and NA sequences present in all eleven isolates resembled those of the Duck/HK/Y280/97-like lineage. Infection by H9N2 is commonplace in Shanghai live-poultry markets, allowing the viruses to have evolved rapidly.

The CD8 molecule is a cell membrane glycoprotein expressed on cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which are involved in the clearance of viruses. However, the functional characterization of goose CD8α is still unclear. The immunobiological characterization of goose CD8α in goose spleen mononuclear cells (MNCs) was examined by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). It was shown that CD8α mRNA levels were significantly up-regulated by in vitro treatment of MNCs with phytohemagglutinin (PHA), concanavalin A (ConA), and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) in a dose-dependent way, but lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) did not have this same effect. Moreover, the time-course effect of CD8α expression in response to mitogens (PHA, ConA, and poly I:C) was evaluated in MNCs. A significant increase in the transcriptional levels of CD8α was detected in new type gosling viral enteritis virus (NGVEV)-infected goose MNCs at 48 h postinfection (PI) and in goose parvovirus (GPV)-infected MNCs at 72 h PI. Also, the number of CD8α+ cells was significantly increased during viral infection from 72 h on. The seminal changes in mRNA profiles of antiviral cytokines (IFN-α, IFN-γ, and IL-18) were observed and were significantly increased during late phases of NGVEV and GPV infection. Accordingly, our data not only contribute to the understanding of the immune characteristics of goose CD8α, but they also provide new insight into the innate antiviral immunity of geese.

Four isolates of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), isolated from chicken, duck, goose and sparrow in Jiangsu province of China in 2002, were compared. The viruses were stable to the treatments of 60 degrees C for 1 h, pH 2.0 and lipid solvents. Their antigenic relatedness values (R) were from 0.76 to 0.78. Chickens infected with the chicken isolate showed severe clinical symptoms of IBD and the mortality rate was 33.3% (2/6). Chickens infected with the other three viruses survived but their bursas were damaged and the bursa/body-weight ratios were lower than those of the uninfected control (p< 0.01). The titers of anti-IBDV antibody in infected chicken sera reached up to 1600 by virus neutralization and 6400 by ELISA at 10 days post infection. The sequences of the variable region of VP2 were aligned and compared, showing nucleotide variations ranging from 1.5 to 6.7% and deduced aminoacid variations from 0.8 to 2.2%. All had the same heptapeptide, S-W-S-A-S-G-S, Asp279, and Ala284. The four viruses clustered on a phylogenetic tree and were distant from the STC strain. These findings suggested that different bird species naturally infected with IBDV could serve as carriers or reservoirs in IBDV transmission and might play a role in the emergence of variant IBDV.

Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and Goose parvovirus (GPV) are considered to be two of the most important and widespread viruses infecting geese. In this study, we generated a recombinant rmNA-VP3, expressing GPV VP3 using a modified goose-origin NDV NA-1 by changing the multi-basic cleavage site motif RRQKR↓F of the F protein to the dibasic motif GRQGR↓L as that of the avirulent strain LaSota as a vaccine vector. Expression of the VP3 protein in rmNA-VP3 infected cells was detected by immunofluorescence and Western blot assay. The genetic stability was examined by serially passaging 10 times in 10-day-old embryonated SPF chicken eggs. Goslings were inoculated with rmNA-VP3 showed no apparent signs of disease and developed a strong GPV and NDV neutralizing antibodies response. This is the first study demonstrating that recombinant NDV has the potential to serve as bivalent live vaccine against Goose parvovirus and Newcastle disease virus infection in birds.

The authors investigated an outbreak of West Nile Fever characterized by severe neurological symptoms and death in a flock of 3600 6-week-old geese. Ataxia, intermittent torticollis and opisthotonus, incoordination, rhythmic side-to-side movement of the head, wriggling of the neck and abnormal head position were features of the disease. Death occurred within 4 to 5 days after the clinical signs appeared. The average daily mortality was 5 to 15, reaching 14% (in total) over a period of 6 weeks. There were no consistent gross pathological lesions, but in a few cases yellowish-grey foci of 3 to 6 mm in diameter were observed on the surface or transection of the brain. Histopathology revealed perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltration and glia cell proliferation in the brainstem, cerebellum, cortex and spinal cord as well as degeneration of neural fibres in the spinal cord. In addition to the lesions caused by the West Nile Virus in the brain, characteristics of circovirus infection such as lymphocyte depletion, vacuolization and basophilic intra-cytoplasmic inclusion bodies containing circovirus-like particles were seen by light and electron microscopy in the cloacal bursa. West Nile Virus infection was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplification of virus-specific nucleic acid from tissue samples of the brain. Based on the nucleotide sequence analysis of the polymerase chain reaction products, 99% identity was found on the tested NS5 region with the IS-98 ST1 strain isolated from a stork in Israel in 1998, and with West Nile Virus stains emerging in the USA in 1999. Using an indirect fluorescent antibody test, high antibody titres against the virus were detected in the serum samples submitted from the affected flock. In selected sera this was confirmed by neutralization antibody test as well.

Thirty Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strains isolated from outbreaks in China during 1996 to 2005 were characterized pathotypically and genotypically. All strains except one were velogenic. An analysis of the variable region (nucleotides 47 to 420) of the F gene indicated that 6 isolates belonged to genotype II, 3 to genotype III, 1 (isolated from a pigeon) to genotype VI, and 20 to genotype VII. Isolates belonging to genotype VII were further divided into five subtypes, VIIa, VIIb, VIIc, VIId, and VIIe, and subtype VIId was made up of VIId1 to VIId5. These results showed that genotype VII isolates might have been the most prevalent in China during the past two decades. Genotype VII isolates shared high homology, but the homology was less than that between genotype VII viruses and the vaccine virus LaSota. Among these NDV isolates, 25 isolates had the velogenic motif (112)R/K-R-Q-K/R-R-F(117) that is consistent with results of the biological tests. However, four of five LaSota-type isolates that contained the lentogenic motif (112)G-R-Q-G-R-L(117) were velogenic, except SY/03, in the view of the biological test. The majority of genotype VII isolates had lost one or two N-glycosylation sites. Finally, a cross-protection experiment in which specific-pathogen-free chickens vaccinated with LaSota were challenged by six NDV isolates showed that more than three isolates were antigenic variants that could be responsible for recent outbreaks of Newcastle disease.

Constant surveillance of live poultry markets (LPMs) is currently the best way to predict and identify emerging avian influenza viruses (AIVs) that pose a potential threat to public health. Through surveillance of LPMs from 16 provinces and municipalities in China during 2014-2016, we identified 3,174 AIV-positive samples and isolated and sequenced 1,135 AIVs covering 31 subtypes. Our analysis shows that H5N6 has replaced H5N1 as one of the dominant AIV subtypes in southern China, especially in ducks. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that H5N6 arose from reassortments of H5 and H6N6 viruses, with the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase combinations being strongly lineage specific. H5N6 viruses constitute at least 34 distinct genotypes derived from various evolutionary pathways. Notably, genotype G1.2 virus, with internal genes from the chicken H9N2/H7N9 gene pool, was responsible for at least five human H5N6 infections. Our findings highlight H5N6 AIVs as potential threats to public health and agriculture.

Our ability to infer unobservable disease-dynamic processes such as force of infection (infection hazard for susceptible hosts) has transformed our understanding of disease transmission mechanisms and capacity to predict disease dynamics. Conventional methods for inferring FOI estimate a time-averaged value and are based on population-level processes. Because many pathogens exhibit epidemic cycling and FOI is the result of processes acting across the scales of individuals and populations, a flexible framework that extends to epidemic dynamics and links within-host processes to FOI is needed. Specifically, within-host antibody kinetics in wildlife hosts can be short-lived and produce patterns that are repeatable across individuals, suggesting individual-level antibody concentrations could be used to infer time since infection and hence FOI. Using simulations and case studies (influenza A in lesser snow geese and Yersinia pestis in coyotes), we argue that with careful experimental and surveillance design, the population-level FOI signal can be recovered from individual-level antibody kinetics, despite substantial individual-level variation. In addition to improving inference, the cross-scale quantitative antibody approach we describe can reveal insights into drivers of individual-based variation in disease response, and the role of poorly understood processes such as secondary infections, in population-level dynamics of disease.

The authors conducted a survey during 1992 to evaluate blood levels of lead and mercury in Inuit adults of Nunavik (Arctic Quebec, Canada). Blood samples obtained from 492 participants (209 males and 283 females; mean age = 35 yr) were analyzed for lead and total mercury; mean (geometric) concentrations were 0.42 micromol/l (range = 0.04-2.28 micromol/l) and 79.6 nmol/l (range = 4-560 nmol/l), respectively. Concentrations of omega-3 fatty acid in plasma phospholipids--a biomarker of marine food consumption--were correlated with mercury (r = .56, p < .001) and, to a lesser extent, with blood lead levels (r = .31, p < .001). Analyses of variance further revealed that smoking, age, and consumption of waterfowl were associated with lead concentrations (r2 = .30, p < .001), whereas age and consumption of seal and beluga whale were related to total mercury levels (r2 = .30, p < .001). A significant proportion of reproductive-age women had lead and mercury concentrations that exceeded those that have been reportedly associated with subtle neurodevelopmental deficits in other populations.

Studies were performed with an inactivated vaccine against the mosquito-borne flavivirus, West Nile virus (WNV). The mammalian cell line, PER.C6, was selected as the platform for WNV growth since both the neurovirulent strains NY99 and ISR98 that cause epidemics in humans and high mortality in geese, respectively, could be propagated to high titers (10(9) to 10(10)TCID(50)/ml) on these cells. Based on the high DNA homology of the WNV envelope (E) protein and non-structural protein 5 (NS5), and identical neurovirulence in mice and geese, we concluded that NY99 and ISR98 viruses are closely related and therefore vaccine studies were performed with ISR98 as a model for NY99. A robust challenge model in domestic geese was set up resulting in 100% mortality within 7 days of intracranial challenge with 500 TCID(50) WNV. Geese were used to assess the efficacy and safety of an inactivated WNV vaccine produced on PER.C6 cells. Efficacy studies demonstrated 91.4% (53/58) protection of geese compared to no protection (0/13) in geese receiving a sham vaccine. A follow-up study in 1800 geese showed that the vaccine was safe with a survival rate of 96.6% (95% lower CL 95.7%). Initial studies on the correlates of protection induced by the vaccine indicate an important role for antibodies since geese were protected when injected intra-cranial with a mixture of serum from vaccinated, non-challenged geese and WNV. In all, these results provide a scientific basis for the development of an inactivated WNV vaccine based on NY99 produced on PER.C6 cells for human and equine use.

The epidemiological role of monophasic Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium tends to increase, indicating pandemic spread. The aim of the present study was to confirm the occurrence of this serological variant in Poland and to report the first cases in Belarus and Ukraine. Genetic similarity of monophasic isolates with Salmonella Typhimurium already present in these countries was assessed. Serotyping, duplex-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, antibiotic resistance and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiling have been used to meet the study objectives. Monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium was found at low frequency in various sources along the food chain, including feed, animals, meat, and sewage sludge. The first isolates date back to 2008. The clones observed in other European countries were found, along with a number of new, unrelated genetic lineages appearing locally in three countries. Monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium is claimed to replace and discontinue the domination of pentaresistant Salmonella Typhimurium. Pigs and pork are assumed to be the main vectors of monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium, but their relevance for public health is limited.

New type gosling viral enteritis virus (NGVEV) caused a serious disease in naive juvenile goslings. In the described studies the performance of 2 vaccines was analyzed: a vaccine containing adjuvanted inactivated NGVEV and a vaccine containing adjuvanted inactivated NGVEV and recombinant goose IL-2. Breeder geese were subcutaneously vaccinated at the beginning of the egg production period with the vaccines. Breeder geese sham vaccinated with PBS served as control. The cellular and humoral immune responses of the vaccinated breeder geese, as well as the presence of maternally derived antibody to NGVEV, were investigated by ELISA, virus neutralization test, and lymphocyte proliferation assay, respectively. A significantly higher immunogenicity (P < 0.05) was induced by the inactivated NGVEV-recombinant goose IL-2 adjuvant vaccine compared with the inactivated NGVEV vaccine. The offspring of the vaccinated birds were challenged with virulent NGVEV (100 50% lethal dose) and the protective efficacy of the vaccines was determined. Furthermore, in a field trial the efficacy of the inactivated NGVEV vaccine was recorded from years 2003 to 2007. No clinical signs or abnormal health status were observed in the vaccinated breeder geese and the progeny. After a single application, >80% protection was shown in the progeny of geese vaccinated against NGVEV challenge for approximately 5 mo. The extensive field trials further demonstrated that vaccination of breeder geese with the inactivated NGVEV vaccine could be a safe and efficacious means to control NGVE disease. Moreover, the level of maternally derived NGVEV antibody titer in the egg yolk reflected the level of NGVEV antibodies in the breeder geese, suggesting that the egg yolk could be used to monitor the vaccination efficacy in commercial goose breeder flocks.

The 2 structurally and functionally related peptides, neuropeptide B (NPB) and neuropeptide W (NPW), together with their receptor(s) (NPBWR1/NPBWR2) constitute the NPB/NPW system, which acts mainly on the central nervous system to regulate many physiological processes in mammals. However, little is known about this NPB/NPW system in nonmammalian vertebrates. In this study, the functionality and expression of this NPB/NPW system and its actions on the pituitary were investigated in chickens. The results showed that: 1) chicken NPB/NPW system comprises an NPB peptide of 28 amino acids (cNPB28), an NPW peptide of 23 or 30 amino acids (cNPW23/cNPW30), and their 2 receptors (cNPBWR1 and cNPBWR2), which are highly homologous to their human counterparts. 2) Using a pGL3-CRE-luciferase reporter system, we demonstrated that cNPBWR2 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells can be potently activated by cNPW23 (not cNPB28), and its activation inhibits the intracellular cAMP signaling pathway, whereas cNPBWR1 shows no response to peptide treatment, suggesting a crucial role of cNPBWR2 in mediating cNPW/cNPB actions. 3) Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that cNPW and cNPB are widely expressed in chicken tissues, including hypothalamus, whereas cNPBWR1 and cNPBWR2 are mainly expressed in brain or pituitary. 4) In accordance with abundant cNPBWR2 expression in pituitary, cNPW23 could dose dependently inhibit GH and prolactin secretion induced by GHRH and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, respectively, in cultured chick pituitary cells, as monitored by Western blotting. Collectively, our data reveal a functional NPB/NPW system in birds and offer the first proof that NPW can act directly on pituitary to inhibit GH/prolactin secretion in vertebrates.

Neutralization escape variants of Murray Valley encephalitis virus were selected using a type-specific, neutralizing, and passively protective anti-envelope protein (E) monoclonal antibody (4B6C-2) which defines epitope E-1c. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed single nucleotide changes in the E genes of 15 variants resulting in nonconservative amino acid substitutions in all cases. One variant had a three-nucleotide deletion in the E gene which resulted in loss of serine at residue 277. Changes were clustered into two separate regions of the E polypeptide (residues 126-128 and 274-277), indicating that E-1c is a discontinuous epitope. One variant (BHv1), altered at residue 277 (Ser-->Ile), failed to hemagglutinate across the pH range 5.5-7.5, in contrast to parental virus and the other escape variants which hemagglutinated at an optimal pH of 6.6. BHv1 was also of reduced neuroinvasiveness in 21-day-old mice following intraperitoneal inoculation compared to the other viruses. Parental virus and the neutralization escape variants grew equally well in both vertebrate and invertebrate cell cultures, indicating that the reduced neuroinvasiveness of BHv1 was not due to a major abnormality of replication.

This article reviews the development of two attenuated West Nile virus (WNV) variants, WNI-25 and WNI-25A. These variants have lost the neuroinvasion trait of the parental virus. Attenuation was achieved through serial passages in mosquito cells and neutralization escape from WNV-specific monoclonal antibody. Genetic analysis reveals amino acid changes between the parental and each of the variants. The attenuated variants preserve the ability to replicate in mice and geese and to induce a protective immune response. WNI-25A was found to be a genetically stable virus. This variant was successfully used as a live vaccine to protect geese against a wild-type virulent WNV field isolate that closely resembles the WNV isolated during the 1999 New York epidemic.

The negative impacts of residual antibiotics in the environment on ecosystem and human health are big concerns. However, little information is available on the antibiotic bioaccumulation in aquaculture farms. In this study, the bioaccumulative potentials of 21 antibiotics in the plasma, bile, liver and muscle of cultured fish from a typical aquaculture area were systematically investigated.

Goose hemorrhagic polyomavirus (GHPV) is the causative agent of hemorrhagic nephritis and enteritis of geese (HNEG), a fatal disease of young geese with high mortality rates. GHPV cannot be efficiently propagated in tissue culture. To provide antigens for diagnostic tests and vaccines, its major structural protein VP1 was recombinantly expressed in Sf9 insect cells and in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. As demonstrated by density gradient centrifugation and electron microscopy, GHPV-VP1 expressed in insect cells formed virus-like particles (VLPs) with a diameter of 45 nm indistinguishable from infectious polyomavirus particles. However, efficiency of VLP formation was low as compared to the monkey polyomavirus SV-40-VP1. In yeast cells, GHPV-VP1 alone formed smaller VLPs, 20 nm in diameter. Remarkably, co-expression of GHPV-VP2 resulted in VLPs with a diameter of 45 nm. All three types of GHPV-VLPs were shown to hemagglutinate chicken erythrocytes. ELISA and hemagglutination inhibition tests using the VLPs as antigen detected GHPV-specific antibodies in up to 85.7% of sera derived from flocks with HNEG but in none of the sera of a clinically healthy flock. However, GHPV-specific antibodies were also detected in sera from two other flocks without HNEG indicating a broad distribution of GHPV due to subclinical or unrecognised infections.

Fat accumulation in the liver is a natural process in goose, which prepares goose for long-distance migration. In contrast to mammalian fatty liver that usually progresses into an irreversible status, steatohepatitis, goose fatty liver can return to normal without obvious pathological damage, suggesting a protective system exists in goose liver. This study was to identify the components of this system. We first focused on goose adiponectin receptor 1 and 2 (Adipor1/2) as they have ceramidase activity, and can cleave ceramide, a group of proinflammatory signaling lipid species. Quantitative analysis indicated that tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnfα), a key proinflammatory cytokine, was down-regulated in goose fatty liver by overfeeding. This inhibition of Tnfα was accompanied with reduced adiponectin and increased Adipor1/2 in the adipose tissues and in the livers of the overfed geese, respectively. To investigate the regulation of goose Adipor2 in the context of fatty liver, we treated goose primary hepatocytes with fatty liver associated factors. Data indicated that Adipor2 was upregulated by glucose and oleate but not palmitate. Its expression was even suppressed by high level of insulin. The regulation of Adipor1 by these factors was quite similar to that of Adipor2 except that glucose did not induce Adipor1. Together, these findings suggest the upregulation of Adipor1/2 may, at least partially, contribute to the inhibition of inflammation in goose fatty liver, and the expression of Adipor1/2 can be regulated by fatty liver-associated factors.

Fifteen virulent Newcastle disease viruses (NDVs) were isolated from diseased birds in Eastern China in 2005. To investigate the antigenic variation in the epitopes on NDV hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein, these isolates, together with six reference strains, were subjected to the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests using five HI-positive monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against velogenic NDV strain ZJ1. The MAbs 2G5, 3A4, 3B5 and 6B1 recognized 12 of the 15 NDV isolates, and exhibited HI activity towards the six reference strains. However, these MAbs did not react with three local isolates, JS-02/05, JS-06/05 and JS-10/05. HN gene sequence analysis of all NDV strains revealed that these MAb-resistant NDV isolates possessed residue K at position 347 of the HN protein, whereas all remaining strains possessed E or G at the same site. To determine the contribution of the residue at position 347 to antigenic epitope formation, we generated by reverse genetics two recombinant viruses, ZJ1HNK with an E347K mutation on ZJ1 HN, and JSHNE with a K347E mutation on JS-06/05 HN. The HI test demonstrated that ZJ1HNK lost reactivity with MAbs 2G5, 3A4, 3B5 and 6B1, whereas JSHNE did react with these MAbs. Further verification by immunofluorescent assay demonstrated that residue 347 was a critical determinant for formation of the antigenic epitope (residues 345-353) on the HN protein.

The evolution of the H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) has resulted in high sequence variations and diverse antigenic properties in circulating viral isolates. We investigated immune responses induced by HA DNA vaccines of two contemporary H5N1 HPAIV isolates, A/bar-headed goose/Qinghai/3/2005 (QH) and A/chicken/Shanxi/2/2006 (SX) respectively, against the homologous as well as the heterologous virus isolate for comparison. Characterization of antibody responses induced by immunization with QH-HA and SX-HA DNA vaccines showed that the two isolates are antigenically distinctive. Interestingly, after immunization with the QH-HA DNA vaccine, subsequent boosting with the SX-HA DNA vaccine significantly augmented antibody responses against the QH isolate but only induced low levels of antibody responses against the SX isolate. Conversely, after immunization with the SX-HA DNA vaccine, subsequent boosting with the QH-HA DNA vaccine significantly augmented antibody responses against the SX isolate but only induced low levels of antibody responses against the QH isolate. In contrast to the antibody responses, cross-reactive T cell responses are readily detected between these two isolates at similar levels. These results indicate the existence of original antigenic sin (OAS) between concurrently circulating H5N1 HPAIV strains, which may need to be taken into consideration in vaccine development against the potential H5N1 HPAIV pandemic.

Thirteen HA agents were isolated in Israel from captive flamingoes (Phoenicopterus ruber), Egyptian geese (Alopochen aegyptiacus) belonging to order Anseriformes, and ibis (Guara rubra) belonging to order Ciconiiformes. The isolation was done from postmortem materials in three cases of severe respiratory disease with high mortality. The isolates were examined serologically and identified as belonging to the serotype 3 of avian paramyxoviruses (APMV-3). The isolates were more close antigenically to the APMV-3b variety (prototype strain--APMV-3/Parakeet/Netherlands/449/75) than to the APMV-3a variety (prototype strain--APMV-3/Turkey/Wisconsin/68). This is the first isolation of APMV-3 from birds belonging to the orders Anseriformes and Ciconiiformes.

Fatty acid synthase, purified from lactating bovine mammary gland, utilizes coenzyme A esters of acetoacetic, 3-hydroxybutyric, and crotonic acids as substrates for its partial reactions at micromolar concentrations. The NADPH:acetoacetyl-CoA reductase had a Km of 5 microM acetoacetyl-CoA and a Vmax of about 4 mumol of NADPH oxidized min-1 mg-1. In contrast, the Km for the model compound, acetoacetyl pantetheine was 820 microM and that of S-acetoacetyl-N-acetylcysteamine was over 40 mM. The reduction of acetoacetyl-CoA was observed with the enzyme from rat tissues also but not with those from avian tissues or yeast. With the bovine mammary enzyme, the reaction was found to oxidize 2 mol of NADPH for every mol of acetoacetyl-CoA consumed. Butyrate was the major product of reduction. The reductase activity was susceptible to inhibition by several sulfhydryl reagents; it was lost when the synthase was dissociated into one-half molecular weight subunits or when the incubation mixture was depleted of CoA. It was competitively inhibited by acetyl-CoA, butyryl-CoA, methylmalonyl-CoA, and 2-methylcrotonyl-CoA. These results as well as its use as a primer in fatty acid synthesis by the enzyme suggest that the acetoacetyl group from acetoacetyl-CoA is transferred to the enzyme, presumably to its 4'-phosphopantheine prosthetic group. The acyl group is then expected to remain attached to the enzyme while it is reduced, dehydrated, and reduced again to form a butyryl group which can either undergo chain elongation, if malonyl-CoA is present, or be released from the enzyme by hydrolysis or transfer to free CoA.

Despite substantial efforts to control H5N1 avian influenza viruses (AIVs), the viruses have continued to evolve and cause disease outbreaks in poultry and infections in humans. In this report, we analyzed 51 representative H5N1 AIVs isolated from domestic poultry, wild birds, and humans in China during 2004 to 2009, and 21 genotypes were detected based on whole-genome sequences. Twelve genotypes of AIVs in southern China bear similar H5 hemagglutinin (HA) genes (clade 2.3). These AIVs did not display antigenic drift and could be completely protected against by the A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 (GS/GD/1/96)-based oil-adjuvanted killed vaccine and recombinant Newcastle disease virus vaccine, which have been used in China. In addition, antigenically drifted H5N1 viruses, represented by A/chicken/Shanxi/2/06 (CK/SX/2/06), were detected in chickens from several provinces in northern China. The CK/SX/2/06-like viruses are reassortants with newly emerged HA, NA, and PB1 genes that could not be protected against by the GS/GD/1/96-based vaccines. These viruses also reacted poorly with antisera generated from clade 2.2 and 2.3 viruses. The majority of the viruses isolated from southern China were lethal in mice and ducks, while the CK/SX/2/06-like viruses caused mild disease in mice and could not replicate in ducks. Our results demonstrate that the H5N1 AIVs circulating in nature have complex biological characteristics and pose a continued challenge for disease control and pandemic preparedness.

We generated a high-growth H5N1/PR8 virus by plasmid-based reverse genetics. The virulence associated multiple basic amino acids of the HA gene were removed, and the resulting virus is attenuated for chickens and chicken eggs. A formalin-inactivated oil-emulsion vaccine was prepared from this virus. When SPF chickens were inoculated with 0.3 ml of the vaccine, the hemagglutinin-inhibition (HI) antibody became detectable at 1 week post-vaccination (p.v.) and reached a peak of 10log2 at 6 weeks p.v. then slowly declined to 4log2 at 43 weeks p.v. Challenge studies performed at 2, 3 and 43 weeks p.v. indicated that all of the chickens were completely protected from disease signs and death. Ducks and geese were completely protected from highly pathogenic H5N1 virus challenge 3 weeks p.v. The duration of protective immunity in ducks and geese was investigated by detecting the HI antibody of the field vaccinated birds, and the results indicated that 3 doses of the vaccine inoculation in geese could induce a 34 weeks protection, while 2 doses induced more than 52 weeks protection in ducks. We first reported that an oil-emulsion inactivated vaccine derived from a high-growth H5N1 vaccine induced approximately 10 months of protective immunity in chickens and demonstrated that the oil-emulsion inactivated avian influenza vaccine is immunogenic for geese and ducks. These results provide useful information for the application of vaccines to the control of H5N1 avian influenza in poultry, including chickens and domestic waterfowl.

An in-situ hybridization (ISH) procedure was developed for the detection of Cryptosporidium sp. in paraffin wax-embedded tissues with a digoxigenin-labelled probe targeting the 18S rRNA. This technique was used in addition to traditional methods, such as haematoxylin and eosin staining, periodic acid-Schiff reaction, transmission electron microscopy and the polymerase chain reaction, to examine the bursa of Fabricius (BF), conjunctiva and other tissues from 20 domestic geese aged 16-36 days for the presence of cryptosporidia. Positive signals were found to a moderate or marked extent in both conjunctival samples (89%) and BF samples (88%) but not in other tissues. Sequencing of the PCR amplification product revealed identity with Cryptosporidium baileyi. The infected geese showed no clinical signs and only scanty histological lesions. These results confirm reports showing that young waterfowl are especially vulnerable to cryptosporidium infection and indicate that the BF and conjunctiva are the preferred sites for the presence of the protozoon. ISH proved a good method for detecting and identifying even small numbers of cryptosporidia in tissue sections.

Aquatic birds are considered the biological and genetic reservoirs of avian influenza virus and play a critical role in the transmission and dissemination of Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV). Both TLR7 and TLR21 are important for the host antiviral immune response. In an in vivo study, goTLR7, not goTLR21, was significantly up-regulated in the lungs of geese at 3 to 7 d after challenge with H9N2. And goOASL expression was induced in the bursa of fabricius, harderian glands and lungs. An increase in goRIG-I was detected in the lung and small intestine, whereas goPKR was increased in the lung but decreased in the thymus. In the in vitro study, goTLR7 and goRIG-I but not goTLR21 were highly induced by H9N2. Moreover, goOASL and goPKR were significantly induced in H9N2-treated PBMCs, whereas goMx was suppressed. The over-expression of goTLR7, not goTLR21, controlled NDV replication in DF-1 cells, resulting in a decrease in viral copies and the viral titres. Furthermore, we explored the cellular localization of goTLR7 and goTLR21 in heterologous (DF-1 and BHK21) and homologous cells (GEF) through ectopic expression of goTLRs. The antiviral functions of goTLR7 and goTLR21 during H9N2 and NDV infection and their cellular locations were reported here for the first time. These results will contribute to better understand the TLR-dependent antiviral immune responses of waterfowl.

Circulating of genotype VII Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is a great threat to the poultry industry worldwide. Virus-like particles (VLPs) are increasingly being considered as potential viral vaccines due to their safety and efficacy. In this study, we analyzed in vitro the stimulatory effects of VLPs containing the matrix and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase of genotype VII NDV on dendritic cells (DCs) and evaluated their immunogenicity in mice. The results showed that immature bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) responded to stimulation with VLPs by up-regulating expressions of MHC II, CD40, CD80, and CD86 molecules and by increasing the cytokine secretions of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6, and IL-12p70. Besides, VLPs enhanced the immunostimulatory capacity of DCs to stimulate autologous T cell proliferation. Furthermore, VLPs can induce efficient humoral and cellular immune responses, and recruit mature DCs to the spleen in C57BL/6 mice, as shown by an obvious increase in double-positive proliferation of splenic CD11c+CD86+ cells. These data indicate that NDV VLPs can be a valuable candidate for NDV vaccine development.

Between July and October 1996, a West Nile (WN) fever epidemic occurred in the southern plain and Danube Valley of Romania and in the capital city of Bucharest, resulting in hundreds of neurologic cases and 17 fatalities. In early October 1996, entomologic and avian investigations of the epidemic were conducted in the city of Bucharest and nearby rural areas. Thirty (41%) of 73 domestic fowl sampled had neutralizing antibody to WN virus, including 5 of 13 ducks (38%), 1 of 1 goose, 19 of 52 chickens (37%), 1 of 1 peahen, and 4 of 6 turkeys (67%). Seroprevalence in domestic fowl (27%, or 7 of 26) from the urban Bucharest site was not significantly different (P = 0.08, by Fisher's exact test) than rates at three rural sites (50%, or 23 of 46). Serum collected from one of 12 Passeriformes, an Erithacus rubecula, was positive for neutralizing antibody to WN virus. A total of 5,577 mosquitoes representing seven taxa were collected. Culex pipiens pipiens accounted for 96% of the mosquitoes collected. A single virus isolate, RO97-50, was obtained from a pool of 30 Cx. p. pipiens females aspirated from the walls and ceiling of a blockhouse located near the center of Bucharest, resulting in a minimum infection rate of 0.19 per 1,000. Antisera prepared against RO97-50 failed to distinguish among RO97-50, WN virus strain Eg101, and Kunjin (KUN) virus strain MRM16. A 2,323-basepair DNA fragment of the envelope (E) glycoprotein gene from RO97-50 and a Romanian WN virus strain obtained from a human cerebrospinal fluid sample, RO96-1030, were sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses of 23 WN virus strains and one KUN virus strain using the amino acid and nucleotide sequences for a small portion of the E gene suggest the existence of two large lineages of viruses. Bootstrap analysis of the nucleotide alignment indicated strong support (95%) for a lineage composed of WN virus strains from northern Africa, including isolates from Egypt and Algeria, and west, central, and east Africa, all of the European isolates, those from France and Romania, an Israeli isolate, and an isolate of KUN virus from Australia. The nucleotide sequence of RO97-50 was identical to the sequence of a WN virus isolate obtained from Cx. neavei mosquitoes from Senegal and Cx. univittatus mosquitoes from Kenya. The phylogenetic analyses were compatible with the introduction of virus into Romania by birds migrating from sub-Saharan Africa, to northern Africa, and into southern Europe.

The structural gene for Escherichia coli thioesterase I (called tesA) has been cloned by use of sequence data obtained from the purified protein. The tesA gene was mapped at 530 kilobase pair of the E. coli physical map (minute 11.6 of E. coli genetic map). The DNA sequence of the tesA gene was obtained and the deduced protein sequence showed that thioesterase I consists of 182 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 20.5 kDa. Comparison of the DNA and protein sequence data suggested that a leader sequence of 26 amino acid residues is cleaved from the primary translation product, and this processing was confirmed by NH2-terminal sequencing of the primary translation product synthesized in vitro. These data predicted that thioesterase I (long believed to be a cytoplasmic protein) is exported to the cell periplasm, a prediction supported by release of the enzyme from cells upon osmotic shock. The TesA protein sequence does not exhibit any significant overall sequence similarity with other known proteins, although the sequence does contain two small sequence elements found in several other thioesterases. One of these elements is a sequence similar to the serine esterase active sites found in serine proteases and four other thioesterases. A serine residue within this TesA element was shown to be covalently labeled with [3H] diisopropyl fluorophosphate, a potent inhibitor of TesA activity. The second sequence element is a histidine-containing sequence found close to the carboxyl terminus that is also found in the carboxyl termini of the four known active serine thioesterases. The physiological role of thioesterase I is unclear. A strain carrying a null mutation of the tesA gene was constructed and found to have no growth phenotype. Moreover, a strain carrying a plasmid that gave massive overproduction of TesA (approximately 100-fold higher than that of the wild type) also grew normally. In addition a strain containing double null mutations in both tesA and tesB (the structural gene for E. coli thioesterase II) also failed to display any growth phenotype. Analysis of the fatty acid compositions of phospholipid, lipid A, and lipoprotein of the above strains showed no significant changes from a wild type strain.

Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) and M. synoviae (MS) were isolated from geese kept for more than a year on a multiple-age chicken farm. Agglutinating antibodies against MG and MS were found in the sera of some geese which were positive also in the haemagglutination-inhibition tests. The isolation of MG and MS from several organs of goose embryos indicates that egg transmission occurs. It is probably the first report concerning isolation of MS from the naturally infected geese and furthermore concerning isolation of MG and MS from naturally infected goose embryos.

The ovary of Chinese goose is easily infected by microorganisms because of the mating behaviour in water, which causes decreased laying performance. This study investigated the time course effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the steroidogenesis and mRNA expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), a class of key pattern recognition receptor, in the breeding goose ovary. The laying geese were treated intravenously with LPS for 0, 6, 12, 24 and 36 h, and all birds were slaughtered approximately 8 h after oviposition. The expression levels of TLRs in the white and yellowish follicles, and granulosa and theca layers of hierarchical follicles were examined by real-time PCR. All 10 members of avian TLR family were differentially expressed among the different follicular tissues. Moreover, at 24 and 36 h after LPS treatment, the hierarchical follicle morphological structure was altered, but the expression levels of TLRs were still higher than the control. Furthermore, during LPS treatment period, the expression pattern of TLRs 2A and 4 genes was similar to that of TLR15 in the white follicles, TLRs 1B, 5 and 15 in the yellowish follicles, TLRs 7 and 15 in the granulosa layer, and TLRs 1A, 2B, 3, 7 and 15 in the theca layer, which had a negative correlation with the kinetics of plasma P4 and E2 concentrations. In conclusion, the mechanism by which pathogen infection inhibited goose follicular growth and further decreased egg production may involve a gradually enhanced inflammatory response and reduced endocrine function. This may be due to stimulated TLRs in the ovary.

An increasing number of studies suggest that ornithine decarboxylase antizyme 1 (OAZ1), which is regarded as a tumor suppressor gene, regulates follicular development, ovulation, and steroidogenesis. The granulosa cells in the ovary play a critical role in these ovarian functions. However, the action of OAZ1 mediating physiological functions of granulosa cells is obscure. OAZ1 knockdown in granulosa cells of geese was carried out in the current study. The effect of OAZ1 knockdown on polyamine metabolism, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and hormone receptor transcription of primary granulosa cells in geese was measured. The viability of granulosa cells transfected with the shRNA OAZ1 at 48 h was significantly higher than the control (p<0.05). The level of putrescine and spermidine in granulosa cells down-regulating OAZ1 was 7.04- and 2.11- fold higher compared with the control, respectively (p<0.05). The CCND1, SMAD1, and BCL-2 mRNA expression levels in granulosa cells down-regulating OAZ1 were each significantly higher than the control, respectively (p<0.05), whereas the PCNA and CASPASE 3 expression levels were significantly lower than the control (p<0.05). The estradiol concentration, ER and LHR mRNA expression levels were significantly lower in granulosa cells down-regulating OAZ1 compared with the control (p<0.05). Taken together, our results indicated that OAZ1 knockdown elevated the putrescine and spermidine contents and enhanced granulosa cell viability and inhibited ER and LHR transcriptions of granulosa cells in geese.

Two breeding flocks of 2-year-old geese in the Landes region of Southwest France were cultured for mycoplasmas. In one flock of 134 birds Mycoplasma gallisepticum was isolated from three individuals, from a different site in each bird (i.e. oesophagus, trachea, cloaca). M. gallisepticum was also isolated from the semen of one goose in the other flock of 70 birds, but in neither flock could the true incidence be determined because of prolific overgrowth by acholeplasmas in nearly all the samples.

This study was conducted in 2005 near Medusa Bay (73 degrees 21' N, 80 degrees 32' E) and the delta of the Pyasina River (74 degrees 10' N, 86 degrees 45' E), northwest of the Taimyr Peninsula. It was shown that in the years when the numbers of the Arctic foxes are high, even though the lemming numbers are high as well, Brent geese nest considerably closer to owls' nests than in the years with low Arctic fox numbers. At values of the Arctic fox densities greater than one breeding pair per 20 km2, the factor of lemming numbers ceases to affect the distance between owl and geese nests. This distance becomes dependent on the Arctic fox density (numbers). When the Arctic fox density is greater than the pronounced threshold, the owl-Brent internest distance is inversely and linearly related to the Arctic fox density.

Using light- and electron-microscopy the location in organs and the time-course of appearance of cells of the myeloid system was studied in goose embryos and goslings. Large numbers of cell forms representing different stages of granulocytopoiesis were found between 15 and 28 days of incubation in the mesenchyma of the kidney and in the reticular tissue of the spleen, but not in the liver and other organs. Thus, before the haemocytopoietic activity of the bone marrow, an activity typical of adult birds, develops, in geese embryonic extra-medullary granulocytopoiesis is characterised by a renal-lienal stage.

An hypothesis has been formulated stating that the rate at which postnatal growth proceeds is at least partly determined by the distribution of growth between different organs. In order to test the hypothesis a series of studies of organ growth has been undertaken in some birds with widely varying growth rate capacities (geese, quail, turkeys, fieldfares and jackdaws). With regard to nidifugous birds the data show that the growth pattern of the goose, a species which has a high growth rate capacity, is characterized by a rapid early development of the digestive organs and the liver whereas that of the quail and the turkey, species which have low growth rate capacities, is characterized by a rapid early development of the pectorals and the feathers. The growth pattern of the nidicolous species, the fieldfare and the jackdaw which also show high growth rate capacities, is similar to that of the goose. These results are in close agreement with the hypothesis.

DVE virus strains isolated from ducks (KPV strain), geese (KLM strain) and an attenuated strain designated DP were compared. Geese vaccinated with the avirulent strain showed 100% protection against the KPV strain, but no or only partial protection against strain KLM, depending on age and sex. Protection against the KLM strain was achieved by using a vaccine containing an avirulent strain and a strain of medium virulence. In goose embryo fibroblast (GEF) cell cultures the virulent strains caused small plaques with sharp margins, whereas the avirulent strain produced large plaques of uneven outline. In the cross-neutralisation tests all strains studied proved to be antigenically identical. The three strains showed similar sensitivity to heat-treatment (at 50 degrees C) and phosphonoacetic acid (PAA), while the KLM strain was slightly more resistant to trypsin-treatment.

After the epoch-making report on X-ray crystal structure of a lysozyme-N-acetylglucosamine trisaccharide complex in 1967, catalytic mechanisms of glycosyl hydrolases have been discussed with reference to the lysozyme mechanism. From the recent findings of chitinolytic enzymes, however, the enzymes were found to have catalytic and substrate binding mechanisms different from those of lysozyme. Based on the X-ray crystal structures of chitinases and their complexes with substrate analogues, the catalytic mechanisms were discussed considering the relative locations of catalytic residues to the bound substrate analogues. Resembling the lysozyme catalytic center, family 19 chitinases, family 46 chitosanases, and family 23 lysozymes have two carboxyl groups at the catalytic center, which are separated (> 10 +) on either side of the catalytic cleft. The catalytic reaction of the enzymes takes place through a single displacement mechanism. In family 18 chitinases, one can identify only one catalytic carboxylate as a proton donor, but not the second catalytic carboxylate whose function and location are similar to those of Asp52 in lysozyme. The catalytic reaction of family 18 chitinases is most likely to take place through a substrate-assisted mechanism. Hen egg white lysozyme has the binding cleft represented by (-4)(-3)(-2)(-1)(+1)(+2). The binding cleft of family 19 chitinases, family 46 chitosanases, and family 23 lysozymes, however, is represented by (-3)(-2)(-1)(+1)(+2)(+3). Molecular dynamics calculation suggests that family 18 chitinases have the binding cleft, (-4)(-3)(-2)(-1)(+1)(+2). The functional diversity of the chitinolytic enzymes might be related to different physiological functions of the enzymes. The enzymes are now being applied to plant protection from fungal pathogens and insect pests. Structure of the targeted chitinous component was determined by a combination of enzyme digestion and solid state CP/MAS NMR spectroscopy, and have been taken into consideration for efficient application of the enzymes. Recent understanding of the catalytic and substrate binding mechanisms would be helpful as well for arrangement of a powerful strategy in such an application.

Ten novel polymorphic microsatellite loci were isolated and characterized from the greylag goose, Anser anser, a long-term monogamous and biparental bird. Additionally, five new primers pairs were designed based on previously published microsatellite locus sequences from closely related species. Multiplex polymerase chain reactions conditions were optimized for all 15 primer pairs. The number of alleles ranged from two to 12 per locus with an observed heterozygosity ranging from 0.07 to 0.85. This marker set will be used to determine rates and origins of extra-pair and parasitic young in a population of individually banded greylag geese with known life histories.

In many species, fecundity is dependent on age. For some populations - particularly those exploiting temporally variable environments - these age-specific fecundities may themselves vary with time. In this report, we investigate the general effects of age and time on clutch size in a wild population of Lesser Snow Geese (Anser caerulescens caerulescens). We show that both factors affect clutch size independently. Age effects are confined almost exclusively to the two, three and four year old age classes. Mean clutch sizes of all age classes show considerable inter-seasonal variation. These temporal differences in fecundity will ultimately influence the dynamics of the population. In particular, they imply that there will be no convergence to a constant growth rate or a stable age distribution.

Strontium-90 ((90)SR) released to the ground near the N Reactor at the U.S. Department of Energy's Hanford Site enters the Columbia River through shoreline seeps. The (90)Sr is then potentially available for uptake by plants and animals. The life history and foraging behavior of nesting Canada geese is such that female geese could ingest (90)Sr while foraging on shoreline plants. Radichemical analyses showed that goose eggshells taken from an island, downstream from the N Reactor, contained more (90)Sr than did eggshells collected from other downstream islands. Reed canary grass samples taken from shoreline areas immediately downstream from the N Reactor contained higher concentrations of (90)Sr than samples from other downstream areas. All goose eggshells did not contain enhanced levels of (90)Sr, and all reed canary grass samples did not contain enhanced levels of (90)Sr, but a relationship exists between the releases of (90)Sr to the Columbia River and the enhanced levels of (90)Sr in some of the environmental samples analyzed.

This study was conducted to investigate the effect of nocturnal light pulses (NLPs) on the feed intake and metabolic rate in geese. Fourteen adult Chinese geese were penned individually, and randomly assigned to either the C (control) or NLP group. The C group was exposed to a 12L:12D photoperiod (12 h light and 12 h darkness per day), whereas the NLP group was exposed to a 12L:12D photoperiod inserted by 15-min lighting at 2-h intervals in the scotophase. The weight of the feed was automatically recorded at 1-min intervals for 1 wk. The fasting carbon dioxide production rate (CO2 PR) was recorded at 1-min intervals for 1 d. The results revealed that neither the daily feed intake nor the feed intakes during both the daytime and nighttime were affected by photoperiodic regimen, and the feed intake during the daytime did not differ from that during the nighttime. The photoperiodic treatment did not affect the time distribution of feed intake. However, NLPs lowered (p<0.05) the mean and minimal CO2 PR during both the daytime and nighttime. Both the mean and minimal CO2 PR during the daytime were significantly higher (p<0.05) than those during the nighttime. We concluded that NLPs lowered metabolic rate of the geese, but did not affect the feed intake; both the mean and minimal CO2 PR were higher during the daytime than during the nighttime.

Avian tembusu virus (TMUV), which was first identified in eastern China, is an emerging virus causing serious economic losses in the Chinese poultry industry. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of goose tembusu virus strain JS804, isolated from Jiangnan white geese with severe neurological signs. The genome of JS804 is 10,990 nucleotides (nt) in length and contains a single open reading frame encoding a putative polyprotein of 3,425 amino acids. Research of the whole sequence of tembusu virus will help us to understand further the molecular and evolutionary characteristics and pathogenesis of this virus.

We have developed a double antibody sandwich (antigen capture) ELISA for the detection of Derzsy's disease virus (GPV-1) antigen produced in cell cultures. This provided unambiguous quantification of virus whereas evaluation of cytopathic effect was sometimes difficult. A blocking ELISA was developed to quantify anti-GPV-1 antibodies in goose sera. This method was rapid, simple, easily standardized and correlated well with a virus neutralization test.

Of various mycoplasma strains of goose original, axanthum strains (609 and 612) caused the death both of goose and chicken embryos, A. laid-lawii strain (606) killed only goose embryos, whereas M. gallinarum (598) failed to kill either. Infection of 3-day-old goslings with these mycoplasmas resulted in no mortality but lesions were produced with A. axanthum in 9 of 10 birds. Less severe lesions were seen in fewer birds infected with other strains. Dual infection of 3-day-old goslings, with maternal antibody to goose parvovirus, with M. gallinarum (598) or A. axanthum (612) and a virulent parvovirus resulted in some death and all birds showed lesions.

Different mechanisms proposed to explain the intra-seasonal decline in clutch size of Lesser Snow Geese (Anser caerulescens caerulescens) were tested at the La Perouse Bay colony, Manitoba, Canada. Ovary examination of females collected after laying revealed that the actual number of eggs produced per female decreased over the laying period. This finding eliminates nest-parasitism, partial clutch predation and renesting attempts as sufficient explanations for seasonal clutch size decline. Follicular atresia induced by reserve depletion was also rejected since its occurrence was similar among early and late nesters. The decline in clutch size was observed within age-classes, and therefore age effects on clutch size and laying date per se do not account for the observed relationship. Clutch size and laying date were respectively positively and negatively correlated with the amount of nutrient reserves in females at the onset of laying, and also covaried within individuals observed breeding in several seasons. Laying date repeatability was estimated at 0.22. It is postulated that the seasonal decline in clutch size results mainly from a positive feed-back of female's nutrient reserves on the hormones controlling ovary development. Hatching synchrony or shortness of the breeding season may be the ultimate factors responsible for the intra-seasonal clutch size decline in Lesser Snow Geese.

An outbreak of severe acute respiratory disease characterized by tracheitis and bronchitis was observed in young goslings on a large-scale goose farm in Hungary. Histological examination revealed amphophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies in the superficial epithelial cells of the trachea and bronchi. Adenovirus-like particles were detected by electron microscopy, and the virus isolated from the trachea and the lungs was identified as egg drop syndrome (EDS) virus by serological and genomic examination. The clinical and pathological signs were reproduced by intratracheal administration of the virus isolate to 1-day-old goslings free of EDS antibodies. The presence of EDS virus DNA in different organs of the naturally and experimentally infected goslings was detected by polymerase chain reaction. This is the first report on the involvement of EDS virus in severe respiratory disease of geese.

Barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) wintering on the island of Schiermonnikoog in the Netherlands abruptly switch all their foraging activities from a dairy pasture (a 'polder') to an adjacent salt-marsh during the early spring. We present evidence to show that this shift is related to changes in the quality of the diet available in these different habitats. Barnacle geese shift from polder to salt-marsh at the precise time that these are equal in dietary protein availability, which occurs as the food plants on the salt-marsh undergo a sudden spring growth. The dairy pasture undergoes its own spring growth shortly afterwards, and more dietary protein is available there for the rest of the year. We suggest that the salt-marsh is a more preferred habitat, but that low dietary protein during the winter prevents its use by barnacle geese. We hypothesize that the salt-marsh may be more preferred due to a lower level of disturbance which permits geese to graze more slowly, improving the utilization of food plants.

Avian bornavirus (ABV) matrix (M) genes were detected by RT-PCR on brain tissue obtained from 192 mute swans harvested from several Northeastern states. A RT-PCR product was detected in 45 samples. Sequencing of the PCR products confirmed the presence of ABV belonging to the 'goose' genotype. The prevalence of positive samples ranged from 28% in Michigan to 0% in northern New York State. Two Rhode Island isolates were cultured. Their M, N, and X-P gene sequences closely matched recently published sequences from Canada geese.

We tested Buchsbaum's hypothesis that food palatability in geese is determined by a hierarchy of feeding cues among which deterrent secondary metabolites (mostly phenols) have a primary role (Buchsbaum et al. 1984). In preference tests, greater snow goose feeding was slightly depressed when grass was sprayed with ferulic acid but not when grass was sprayed with p-coumaric and tannic acids. Extracts of Timothy grass, red clover or alfalfa sprayed on grass also failed to depress goose feeding. In a multifactor experiment, phenol and protein content and height of grass were manipulated simultaneously. When ferulic acid was sprayed, protein and phenol content interacted in determining goose feeding preferences; protein content had no effect in the absence of phenol but did have an effect when phenol was added. When tannic acid was used in a similar experiment, results were inconclusive because of a significant and complex interaction between protein content and height of grass. Our results generally failed to support Buchsbaum's hypothesis that phenol content of plants has a primary role in determining food preference in geese. Protein content of plants seemed to be a more important factor.

This paper presents data about the isolation of members of the order Mycoplasmatales from material of goose origin. Acholeplasma laidlawii strains were isolated from 2 to 8 day old goslings with heavy fibrinous airsacculitis, peritonitis and perihepatitis. Losses reached 30% of the flock by the end of the 8th week of age. Acholeplasma axanthum strains were detected in goose-embryos that died on the 13th day of incubation. A significant loss (up to 60%) of embryos was observed in the flock and some layers died showing fibrinous peritonitis, salpingitis and abdominal airsacculitis. Mycoplasma gallinarum also was isolated from goose-embryo fibroblast tissue cultures. All strains except A. laidlawii caused cytoplasmic vacuolization and intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies in goose-embryo fibroblast tissue cultures. The alteration observed in chicken-embryo fibroblast cell cultures were similar; in addition, the A. laidlawii caused a marked pycnosis of the cells.

Serial transfer of the goose parvovirus strain B, causal agent of Derzsy's gosling disease, in cultured goose-embryo fibroblast (GEF) resulted in a mutant (designated as Bav) apathogenic for both goose embryos and susceptible goslings. Goose embryos inoculated with the 38th or higher passages of strain B survived the infection, although the virus replicated in their organs. Susceptible goslings survived challenge with the Bav strain without showing symptoms, and developed normally. Only 4.2% of gosling progeny of parents vaccinated twice with strain Bav died after challenge with the virulent strain B goose parvovirus compared with 95% of gosling progeny of unvaccinated parents. Progeny of vaccinated and unvaccinated geese were placed on a farm on which Derzsy's disease was present. During the first month of life mortality was 7.7% in the progeny of vaccinated geese compared with 59.8% in the progeny of the unvaccinated geese. At 8 weeks of age the mean weight of the vaccinated goslings was 20% greater than for the unvaccinated goslings. These results indicate that the attenuated apathogenic Bav mutant is suitable for the immunisation of layers to protect their progeny by passive immunisation against Derzsy's disease.

Hemorrhagic nephritis enteritis of geese (HNEG) is an epizootic viral disease caused by infection with goose hemorrhagic polyomavirus (GHPV) that affects domestic geese. This study describes the epizootic analysis, laboratory diagnosis, and molecular characterization of GHPV isolates associated with HNEG cases in Poland. HNEG symptoms persisted in infected flocks for 2 wk with a 32% mortality rate. Primary gross lesions included hemorrhaging of the kidneys, intestines, and lungs. Histopathologic examination confirmed HNEG and identified that the causative agent was similar to other GHPV isolates and identical to the Toulouse 2008 isolate.

Eight coccidian species found in the domestic goose (Anser anser domesticus) in the south-west of France are described. An identification key based on the morphological features of sporulated oocysts is proposed. Of the eight species, two had not, previously, been reported in domestic geese; one of them might be a new species.

The spread of inflammation of the cloaca and phallus in goose flocks was investigated. In the flocks surveyed, 57.5 to 71.8% of the initial gander stock and 39.8 to 100% of the replacement ganders were affected. Based on the results of several hundred attempts at mycoplasma isolation, a relationship was found between mycoplasma infection and the occurrence of inflammation of the cloaca and phallus in the flocks. Mycoplasmas were frequently isolated from the mucous membrane of the phallus, the pallic lymph, and the inner organs of ganders in the affected flocks, but not from birds in unaffected flocks. Two biochemically (glucose-splitting and arginine-hydrolysing) and three serologically distinct types of mycoplasmas have been isolated. One of them proved to be identical to strain 46, identified by J.M. Bradbury as M. cloacale, and two strains may represent new Mycoplasma species since they differ serologically from all previously known Mycoplasma spp. In the diseased flocks, the strain designated 1220 (8390) and the antibodies produced against it were of most frequent occurrence. At the peak of egg production, mycoplasmas were isolated from 92.1% of the phallic lymph samples, and 94.6% of the test sera were positive for antibodies to strain 1220 (8390).

The mechanism of action by which oxidative stress induces granulosa cell apoptosis, which plays a vital role in initiating follicular atresia, is not well understood. In the present study, the effect of 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NPA) on oxidative stress and apoptosis in granulosa cells in geese was investigated. Our results showed that treatment with 3-NPA at 5.0 mmol/l for 24 h increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by 25.4% and decreased granulosa cell viability by 45.5% (P<0.05). Catalase and glutathione peroxidase gene expression levels in granulosa cells treated with 3-NPA were 1.32- and 0.49-fold compared with those of the control cells, respectively (P <0.05). A significant decrease in the expression level of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) protein and remarkable increases in the levels of Bax, p53 and cleaved-Caspase 3 proteins and the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 expression in granulosa cells treated with 3-NPA were observed (P<0.05). Furthermore, a 38.43% increase in the percentage of early apoptotic cells was also observed in granulosa cells treated with 3-NPA (P<0.05). Moreover, the expression levels of NF-κB, Nrf2, Fhc, Hspa2 and Ho-1 in granulosa cells treated with 3-NPA were elevated 4.36-, 1.63-, 3.62-, 27.54- and 10.48-fold compared with those of the control cells (P<0.05), respectively. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that treatment with 3-NPA induces ROS production and apoptosis and inhibits the viability of granulosa cells in geese. Furthermore, 3-NPA triggers increases in the expression of cleaved-Caspase 3 protein and the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 expression, and induces the early apoptosis of granulosa cells.

The "value of information" (VOI) is a generic term for the increase in value resulting from better information to guide management, or alternatively, the value foregone under uncertainty about the impacts of management (Yokota and Thompson, Medical Decision Making 2004; 24: 287). The value of information can be characterized in terms of several metrics, including the expected value of perfect information and the expected value of partial information. We extend the technical framework for the value of information by further developing the relationship between value metrics for partial and perfect information and describing patterns of their performance. We use two different expressions for the expected value of partial information to highlight its relationship to the expected value of perfect information. We also develop the expected value of partial information for hierarchical uncertainties. We highlight patterns in the value of information for the Svalbard population of the pink-footed goose (Anser brachyrhynchus), a population that is subject to uncertainty in both reproduction and survival functions. The framework for valuing information is seen as having widespread potential in resource decision making, and serves as a motivation for resource monitoring, assessment, and collaboration.

In this study we accumulate evidence that brown hare competes with brent goose for food resources in a temperate salt marsh. We show that both species overlap in habitat use and share food plants. The two herbivores mainly used the common habitat at different times of the day, with hares active in the dark and geese during the daylight. During the morning and evening, however, the habitat was exploited simultaneously. Food availability was manipulated by excluding brent geese on both small-scale (30 m2) and large-scale (0.96 ha) plots, while hares had free access everywhere. Exclusion of brent geese enhanced the level of utilisation by hares in both Festuca and Puccinellia dominated marshes, which are among the most intensively grazed parts of the salt marsh. The increase in hare grazing pressure following goose exclusion was stronger, when the adjacent control plots had attracted more goose visitation. When geese were excluded, the decrease in Festuca consumption by geese was completely matched by increased hare grazing, while for Puccinellia only part of the `surplus' was harvested. Enhanced levels of hare utilisation were not due to geese interfering directly with hare, nor due to hares avoiding goose droppings. Considering the interaction from the other perspective, hares were observed to disturb geese effectively in every spring. This might have reduced exploitation by geese of the shared resources. On the basis of our experimental results, we conclude that in this salt- marsh system competition for food with brent geese plays a role in the habitat use of hares, and that hares can reduce goose exploitation of shared habitats.

Two different West Nile virus (WNV) strains caused lethal encephalitis in a flock of geese and a goshawk in southeastern Hungary in 2003 and 2004, respectively. During the outbreak in geese, 14 confirmed human cases of WNV encephalitis and meningitis were reported in the same area. Sequencing of complete genomes of both WNV strains and phylogenetic analyses showed that the goose-derived strain exhibits closest genetic relationship to strains isolated in 1998 in Israel and to the strain that emerged in 1999 in the United States. WNV derived from the goshawk showed the highest identity to WNV strains of lineage 2 isolated in central Africa. The same strain reemerged in 2005 in the same location, which suggests that the virus may have overwintered in Europe. The emergence of an exotic WNV strain in Hungary emphasizes the role of migrating birds in introducing new viruses to Europe.

Temporary feeding on willow buds and leaves by nesting greater snow geese provided us with an opportunity to test the relative importance of nutrients and deterrents in affecting the palatability for geese of a food plant with a high phenol content. Protein, total phenol and fiber (neutral and acid detergent fiber, and lignin) were analyzed in closed and open buds and in rolled and open leaves. Geese feed on willows at the open-buds and rolled-leaf stages but not at the closed-bud and open-leaf stages. Protein content was higher in open buds and rolled leaves (25-27%) than in closed buds and open leaves (19-21%). Phenol content increased during leaf emergence but was already high (14%) in rolled leaves. All plant fibers were very high in closed buds but declined rapidly during leaf emergence. The increase in phenol: protein ratio appeared to be more important than phenol concentration alone in explaining the cessation of feeding by geese on willow leaves whereas the high fiber content of closed buds may explain why they were not eaten. Our results illustrate the value of a multifactorial approach in the study of the food selection process in herbivores.

The consequences of philopatric and dispersal behaviours under changing environmental conditions were examined using data from the colony of Lesser Snow Geese (Anser caerulescens caerulescens) breeding at La Pérouse Bay, Manitoba, Canada. In response to increased population size and decreased food abundance over time, increasing numbers of family groups have been dispersing from the traditional feeding areas. Goslings from dispersed broods were significantly heavier (7.3%), and had longer culmens (3.1%), head lengths (2.6%) and marginally longer tarsi (1.9%) on average than goslings that remained within La Pérouse Bay itself. These differences were consistent in each of 5 years. There was no evidence that the larger size of dispersed goslings was due to either a tendency for larger adults to disperse to alternative sites, or increased mortality of smaller goslings among dispersed broods. The most likely cause for the larger size of goslings from dispersed broods was the significantly greater per capita availability of the preferred salt-marsh forage species at non-traditional brood-rearing areas. The larger goslings in non-traditional feeding areas showed significantly higher firstyear survival, suggesting that the use of deteriorating traditional feeding areas may currently be maladaptive in this population.

By the method of selective absorption with tissue, protective serum antibodies have been demonstrated in the case of an infection of unknown cause; namely, a chicken sarcoma transmitted by a filterable agent. Geese were repeatedly injected with the finely ground sarcoma and with blood from fowls moribund of it; and their sera acquired the power to prevent the tumor-producing agent from causing growths. That this was not due to antibodies elicited by the chicken tissue as such was shown by exhaustion of the goose sera with chicken red cells, a step which had not the least effect on the tumor-preventing power, and also by experiments with rabbits immunized as were the geese. These animals developed strong chicken antibodies in their sera which failed nevertheless to affect the tumor-producing agent. Serum immunity to the chicken sarcoma is weak at best; and in the case of some other infections of unknown cause, more striking results may be anticipated from the method of selective absorption. It is even conceivable that by its means sera of therapeutic usefulness may become available. But much remains to be settled as regards the dangers of exhausted sera and the limitations of the method. Fortunately there exists an immediate field for the latter in laboratory studies on the nature of immunity to infections of which the cause has not been recognized.

Breast muscles of twenty-four Eastern Zhejiang White Geese were randomly divided into three groups: control, Cytochalasin B (Cyt B) and Jasplakinolide (Jasp) treatments during postmortem conditioning. The myofibrillar fraction index (MFI), actin filaments and the levels of F-actin, G-actin and actin associated proteins (cofilins and tropomodulins) during conditioning were investigated. In control, the degraded tropomodulins, increased G-actin and disrupted actin filaments were observed at 4 and 7days; the increase of MFI and decrease of F-actin content were shown during conditioning. Cyt B treatments accelerated the transformation from F-actin to G-actin, weakened actin filaments and increased MFI compared to the control, while Jasp gained the opposite effect against Cyt B. We concluded that depolymerization of actin filaments regulated by tropomodulins contributed to myofibrillar fraction during conditioning. This work provided a new pathway of tenderization by the depolymerization of actin filaments.

The polymorphism of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and tyrosinase (TYR) genes have been proposed to play a vital role in coat colour genesis in mammals, but their role remains ambiguous in geese at best. Here, we cloned and sequenced 1,397 bp coding region of MITF gene and a 588 bp fragment of TYR exon 1 for polymorphism analysis among 157 domestic geese showing three types of plumage colour. We detected a total of three SNPs (c.280T>C, c.345G>A, and c.369G>A) in TYR and six haplotypes (H1-H6). Among them, haplotypes H1, H2, H3, and H5 were significantly associated with white plumage trait of Zhedong White Geese. However, only diplotype H1H1 and H3H5 were significantly associated with white plumage trait of Zhedong White Geese (p<0.01). We only detected one SNP (c.1109C>T) for MITF gene and found that genotype CT and TT were significantly associated with white plumage trait of Zhedong White Geese. Briefly, our study suggested an association between polymorphisms of TYR and MITF genes and the plumage colour trait in domestic geese.

The complete proviral sequence of a Muscovy duck-origin reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) associated with spontaneously occurring neoplastic disease in 2011 in Zhejiang province, China, was determined. Comparative sequence analyses indicate that the present REV is most closely related to the chicken-origin REV isolate HLJR0901 and the goose-origin isolate Goose/3410/06. These findings suggest that chickens or geese may transmit the REV to Muscovy ducks.

Extrapair paternity varies from 0 to over 70% of young among various populations of birds. Comparative studies have suggested that this variation is related to nesting density, breeding synchrony and the proportion of extrapair copulations. We used minisatellite DNA fingerprinting to examine levels of extrapair paternity in Ross's geese, Chen rossi, and lesser snow geese, C. caerulescens c. (hereafter snow geese) nesting in the largest known goose colony in the world. These geese have one of the highest known percentages of extrapair copulation (46-56% of all attempted copulations), and all of these appeared to be forced. Among all successful copulations, 33 and 38% were extrapair in Ross's and snow geese, respectively. Despite the high percentage of extrapair copulations, extrapair paternity was low in both Ross's and snow geese (2-5% of young). Extrapair paternity was not related to nest density in either species. However, in snow geese, extrapair paternity was more likely to occur in nests of females that nested asynchronously, either early or late in the season. This is one of a few reported examples of a negative relationship between extrapair paternity and breeding synchrony. Extrapair young also tended to come from eggs laid later in the clutch. Although forced extrapair copulations appear to be a relatively inefficient reproductive tactic for males, they may provide a reproductive advantage for some males.

Replication of the hepadnavirus DNA genome is accomplished via reverse transcription of an intermediate, pregenomic RNA molecule. This process is likely to be carried out by a virally encoded, multifunctional polymerase which possesses DNA- and RNA-dependent DNA polymerase and RNase H activities. However, the nature of the product(s) of the polymerase gene predicted to mediate these functions is unclear. Biochemical studies of the polymerase protein(s) have been limited by its apparent low abundance in virus particles and, until recently, the inability to express active polymerase protein(s) heterologously. We have used activity gel assays to detect DNA- and RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities associated with highly purified duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) core particles (S. M. Oberhaus and J. E. Newbold, J. Virol. 67:6558-6566, 1993). Now we report that the same approach identifies a 35-kDa RNase H activity in association with highly purified DHBV core particles and crude preparations of virions from DHBV-infected ducks and woodchuck hepatitis virus-infected woodchucks. This is the first report of the detection of an hepadnavirus-associated RNase H activity. Its apparent size is smaller than any of the DNA polymerase activities that we detected previously and significantly smaller than the full-length protein predicted from the polymerase open reading frame (p85 for DHBV). These data suggest that the viral polymerase and RNase H activities are separable and that these enzymes may coordinate their activities in vivo by forming a complex.

An agar gel precipitin (AGP) test and virus neutralisation (VN) test were developed using antigens prepared in duck eggs, to detect and measure antibodies against goose parvovirus. The tests were evaluated using sera collected from the following sources; forty three-month-old geese that had survived Derzsy's disease as goslings, adult geese from a farm where an outbreak of Derzsy's disease had occurred in goslings 14 months earlier, geese that had received a duck embryo adapted goose parvovirus vaccine and parvovirus antisera donated by other laboratories. Of the Derzsy's disease survivors, eight of nine had high AGP and VN antibody titres throughout the observation period. Eight of 19 geese from a farm in which Derzsy's disease had occurred showed a positive VN antibody response, of which five also showed a positive AGP response. Virus neutralising antibodies were detected in all sera from the vaccinated groups compared with the AGP test which detected nine out of 20. Both tests detected high antibody levels in the parvovirus antisera from other laboratories. The findings suggest that the VN test was more sensitive in detecting low levels of antibody than the AGP test. However, the simple and inexpensive AGP test is a useful method of assessing the immune status of geese to Derzsy's disease.

A herpesvirus (GHV 552/89) associated with high mortality in a flock of domestic geese in Australia was compared with duck virus enteritis (DVE) herpesvirus by cross-protection studies in domestic geese, Muscovy ducks and commercial Pekin ducks. In DVE-vaccinated geese, Muscovy ducks and Pekin ducks, mortality levels of 100, 50 and 0%, respectively, were recorded following challenge with GHV 552/89. Conversely, in geese, Muscovy ducks and Pekin ducks immunized with inactivated GHV 552/89, 100% mortality was observed in the geese and Muscovy ducks, and 80% in the Pekin ducks following challenge with DVE virus. The isolate was also compared with six other avian herpesviruses using cross-neutralization tests in cell cultures. No detectable cross-neutralization occurred with any of the avian herpesviruses tested. Further characterization of GHV 552/89 was undertaken by comparing its genome with strains of DVE herpesvirus using restriction endonuclease analysis of the viral DNA and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Following digestion with HindIII, the DNA fragment pattern of GHV 552/89 was found to be completely different from the DVE viruses. Similarities were found between the digestion patterns of a UK and a US DVE isolate, but both were distinguishable from a UK vaccine strain. The results of the PCR analysis and comparison using two DVE-specific primer sets did not produce specific amplification products of expected molecular weights (603 and 446 base pairs) from the GHV 552/89 genome. The PCR products derived from the DVE strains were similar to those derived from the DVE control DNA. From the results of this study, it is concluded that the goose herpesvirus GHV 552/89 is antigenically and genomically distinct from DVE herpesvirus.

Viruses isolated from liver and gut of dead 2- to 4-week-old goslings were identified as adenoviruses. The main characteristics of the strains were: development of intranuclear inclusion bodies in virus-infected cells; a buoyant density of the infective particles in CsC1 of 1.33-1.34 g/ml; icosahedral virions measuring 78-83 nm in diameter which had no envelope; a linear duplex DNA genome with a molecular weight of 25-29 x 10(6) daltons. These adenoviruses did not cross-react in neutralisation tests with 11 fowl, two turkey and two duck adenovirus serotypes, however, they shared a common complement-fixing antigen with fowl adenoviruses. Based on the results of the cross-neutralisation tests and on the cleavage pattern of DNAs by BamHI and Hind III restriction endonucleases, the seven adenovirus strains studied represent three distinct goose adenovirus serotypes. The goose adenoviruses caused neither clinical symptoms nor pathological lesions after infection of 3-day-old goslings.

We report on the intra-Amazonian migration of a pair of Orinoco Geese (Neochen jubata) from Manú National Park, Peru. The species is Critically Endangered in Peru, so a major aim of the study was to aid conservation planning by learning the wet season location of the country's last known breeding population. We captured a breeding pair on October 27, 2010, and fitted the birds with Microwave Telemetry, Inc. GPS/Argos satellite PTT's. The pair migrated ∼655 km from Manú National Park to the Llanos de Moxos, Bolivia (Dept. of Bení) in a predominantly longitudinal migration, reaching their final destination on December 23, 2010. Major movements (>5 km per time period) were almost exclusively at night and were undertaken with and without moonlight. Foraging areas used at stopovers in the Llanos de Moxos were remarkably limited, suggesting the importance of grazing lawns maintained by the geese and other herbivores, possibly including cattle. Orinoco Geese are resident in the Llanos de Moxos year-round, so the Manú geese represent a partial migration from the Bení region. We hypothesize that cavity nest limitation explains the partial migration of Orinoco Geese from the Llanos de Moxos.

1. This study investigated the impact of melatonin and LPS on goose growth and the intestinal microbiome.2. Geese were injected with a control solution (C), LPS solution (L), melatonin solution (M), and both LPS and melatonin solution (LM), respectively. Faecal samples from each group were used to analyse microbial diversity and function for geese with different treatments.3. The results showed that the M group had a little improvement in growth compared with the C group, but were much higher than the L and LM groups. A clear distinction between M and other groups was seen with regard to alpha and beta diversity in the biome. The dominant bacteria phyla were Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria spp. in all groups. Unclassified bacteria were dominant in all groups at the genus level. Significant KEGG enrichment pathways in the M group were involved in processing metabolism and genetic information, while the L group was related to processing metabolism and environmental information.4. This study provided a foundation for future studies targeting the specific effect of important bacterial populations on goose growth performance.

Pre-breeding survival, i.e. survival from fledging up to the third winter, of barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) was analysed by using more than 45000 resightings of 1302 individually marked birds. Since observations from the wintering areas only were used, the survival estimates obtained were not confounded by natal dispersal. Post-fledging survival, i.e. survival from fledging to the start of the first winter, differed significantly among the 10 cohorts analysed. These differences were related to the mean body weight and mean tarsus length of cohorts just before fledging. In further analyses, when data from all cohorts were combined, body weight and tarsus length of individuals just before fledging were found to be positively related to Post-fledging survival. Post-fledging survival rates were, on average, lower than survival rates after the first winter. This age effect was largest in cohorts with low mean body weight at capture and was absent in cohorts with high mean body weight at capture. The age effect on survival could only partly be explained by individuals with low body weight having lower survival and successively disappearing from the cohort. It was therefore concluded that other factors must have contributed to the age effect as well. It is hypothesized that lightweight birds are more vulnerable to, for example, diseases, parasites and predation during the first months of their life. Once they have survived this critical period, the effects of characters related to low body weight at capture seem to disappear. Body size of juveniles just before fledging has previously been found to be greatly affected by weather factors and the availability of high quality food during the growth period. Hence, a considerable part of the observed variation in Pre-breeding survival appears to be outside the individual's control.

We detected integrons in 298 of 1106 Escherichia coli isolates obtained from the feces of pigs, chicken, ducks and elks. Among the sources there was higher number of integrons detected in the isolates of pigs. No integron was found in the isolates of gooses. Detection of lot of integrons in these isolates discovers the possibility of spread of antibiotic resistance genes in the environment.

Every year, bar-headed geese (Anser indicus) perform some of the most remarkable trans-Himalayan migrations, and researchers are increasingly interested in understanding the physiology underlying their high-altitude flight performance. A major challenge is generating reliable measurements of blood parameters on wild birds in the field, where established analytical techniques are often not available. Therefore, we validated two commonly used portable clinical analysers (PCAs), the i-STAT and the HemoCue systems, for the analysis of blood parameters in bar-headed geese. The pH, partial pressures of O2 and CO2 (PO2 and PCO2), haemoglobin O2 saturation (sO2), haematocrit (Hct) and haemoglobin concentration [Hb] were simultaneously measured with the two PCA systems (i-STAT for all parameters; HemoCue for [Hb]) and with conventional laboratory techniques over a physiological range of PO2, PCO2 and Hct. Our results indicate that the i-STAT system can generate reliable values on bar-headed goose whole blood pH, PO2, PCO2 and Hct, but we recommend correcting the obtained values using the linear equations determined here for higher accuracy. The i-STAT is probably not able to produce meaningful measurements of sO2 and [Hb] over a range of physiologically relevant environmental conditions. However, we can recommend the use of the HemoCue to measure [Hb] in the bar-headed goose, if results are corrected. We emphasize that the equations that we provide to correct PCA results are applicable only to bar-headed goose whole blood under the conditions that we tested. We encourage researchers to validate i-STAT or HemoCue results thoroughly for their specific study conditions and species in order to yield accurate results.

It is known from primates that alliance partners may support each other's interests in competition with others, for example, through repeated agonistic attacks against a particular individual. We examined serial aggressive interactions between greylag goose families and other flock members. We found that repeated attacks towards the same individual were common and that up to five serial attacks by family members followed an initial attack. Family size did not affect the frequency of such serial attacks. Juvenile geese evidently benefited most from active social support through serial attacks. About 60% of the juveniles' lost primary interactions were subsequently reversed by another family member. This may be one of the reasons why juveniles rank higher in the social hierarchy than would be expected from their age and size alone. Losses in serial attacks predominantly occurred against other, presumably higher-ranking, family geese and ganders. We propose three major functions/consequences of serial attacks. Analogous to primates, serial attacks in greylag geese may serve to reinforce a losing experience of an opponent defeated in a preceding attack. On the side of the winning family, serial attacks may reinforce the experience of winning. Both winning and losing experiences are linked with physiological consequences in higher vertebrates, affecting the future social performance of winners or losers. Finally, serial attacks may signal the agonistic potential of a family to other flock members. This is supported by heart rate data, which indicate that greylags are competent to interpret third-party relationships.

This is a proof of concept paper based on chronological samples of growing feathers from geese thought to be molt-migrants. When molt-migrant birds initiate molt shortly after migrating to a new isoscape, isotope values measured along the length of their feathers should change continuously. To assess long-term changes and daily cycling in δ (15)N and δ (13)C values, we serially sampled a growing primary from three presumed molt-migrant geese. Two showed changing δ (15)N signatures along the length of their growing primary, indicating they were molt-migrants, while the third, presumably a resident, showed no change. We then resampled these feathers at closer intervals for evidence of the predicted diel cycle in the use of exogenous and endogenous protein for feather growth, generated by the diel feeding cycle of these geese. As predicted, a periodicity of ca. 24 h in δ (15)N values was found along the primary of the two equilibrating geese, but not in the other goose that was probably a resident. Our results demonstrate that chronological sampling along the length of individual primaries holds great potential for identifying individuals that are molt-migrants.

The effects of grazing by captive goslings of the Lesser Snow Goose on coastal vegetation at La Pérouse By. Manitoba were investigated. Swards of Carex subspathacea, Festuca rubra and Calamagrostis deschampsioides were grazed once for different periods (0-180 min) and regrowth of vegetation determined, based on measurements of standing crop, net above-ground primary production (NAPP) and forage quality (leaf nitrogen content). The amounts of foliage removed from swards of Carex subspathacea increased with the length of the grazing period, but after 44 days of regrowth there were no significant differences in above-ground biomass between control and grazed plots. While the amount of foliage removed by goslings from swards of Festuca rubra increased with the length of the grazing period (except after 150 min of grazing), the increase in biomass following defoliation was similar among treatments. Goslings removed little biomass from swards of Calamagrostis deschampsioides, even when the opportunity for grazing was 180 min. No significant differences in standing-crop or NAPP between grazed and ungrazed plots were detected by the end of summer. Grazing had no significant effect on amounts of nitrogen in leaf tissue of all species, suggesting that faecal nitrogen was not rapidly incorporated into plant biomass within the growing season. Patterns of regrowth of these species are compared to that of Puccinellia phryganodes. An increase in goose numbers in recent years has led to birds foraging on less preferred species, such as Calamagrostis deschampsiodes and Festuca rubra. Their poor nutritional quality and a lack of a rapid growth response following defoliation may explain, in part, the decline in the weight of wild goslings recorded over the last decade.

Studies were carried out in 2000-2007 near Medusa Bay (73.21' N, 80.32' E) and along the Agapa River (from 70 degrees 11', 86 degrees 15' E. down to the mouth 71 degrees 26' N, 89 degrees 13' E), in the northwestern and central parts of the Taimyr Peninsula. White-fronted goose nests are usually spread in the tundra or placed in 1-3 nest colonies near nests or staging points of snowy owls, peregrine falcons, or rough-legged buzzards. The intent of white-fronted geese to breed near birds of prey or owls increases sharply when arctic fox numbers are high. In the area near Medusa Bay, white-fronted geese nest much closer to peregrine falcon nests than in the area along the Agapa River. At the latter location, white-fronted geese lose the competition to red-breasted geese, which are more numerous here. Bean geese, in spite of their greater size and ability to protect their nests against arctic foxes, really tend to breed near peregrine falcons or buzzards, where they manage to compete with red-breasted geese.

A H3N8 subtype of avian influenza virus, A/goose/Guangxi/020G/2009(H3N8) (GX020G), was isolated from the Guangxi Province of China in 2009. All eight gene segments of the GX020G strain were sequenced. Sequence analysis indicated that this H3N8 virus is a novel reassortant strain. The genome sequences provide useful information for understanding the epidemiology and molecular characteristics of the H3N8 subtype of influenza virus in southern China.

There is no scientific research regarding Egyptian goose (Alopochen aegyptiacus) meat; therefore, a chemical analysis to establish the nutritional characteristics of the breast portion is described. Meat from guinea fowl, Pekin duck, ostrich, and broiler chicken were used as a reference. The high intramuscular fat content of Egyptian goose meat (5.6 g/100 g) may be linked to the fact that this species relies on fat for heat insulation and buoyancy. Egyptian goose meat is very high in polyunsaturated fatty acids (39.7%). The polyunsaturated fatty acid/saturated fatty acid ratio is within the recommendations (>0.4), although the n-6/n-3 ratio is higher than the suggested value of 5. The high Fe content of 7.5 mg/100 g is the differentiating factor within the mineral compositions and is related to the physical activity endured by the breast muscle of Egyptian geese. This study provides new insight into the nutritional characteristics of a meat species providing crucial information that is, as of yet, not available in the literature.

The lack of a sufficient number of molecular markers seriously limits the cognition of genetic relationships within and between populations of many species. Likewise, the genetic diversity of domestic goose (Anser anser domesticus), with a great number of breeds throughout the world, remains poorly understood at the molecular level.

This present experiment was performed to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation of chitosan (CS) on immune function in growing Huoyan geese. A total of 320 28-day-old healthy growing Huoyan geese (sex balance) with similar body weight were randomly allotted into control, CS100, CS200, and CS400 groups. Each group includes 4 replicates with 20 geese per replicate, and the feeding trial lasted for 4 wk. The 4 diets contained 0, 100, 200, and 400 mg CS per kg feed, respectively. The results showed that compared with the control group, the relative weight of thymus, serum concentrations of IGF-I, INS, GH, T3, T4, IgM, IgG, IgA, complement C3, and IL-2 in CS200 group were significantly higher at both 42 and 56 D of age, respectively (P < 0.05). In addition, relative weight of bursa of fabricius (BF), spleen, serum complement C4, and TNF-a concentrations in CS200 group were higher at 56 D of age (P < 0.05), no differences were observed at 42 D of age (P > 0.05). These results indicated that addition of 200 mg/kg CS enhanced immune organs weight, serum concentrations of immunoglobulins, complements, hormone, as well as cytokines, and improved immune function of growing Huoyan geese.

Brant goose colonies around snowy owl nests have been studied near Meduza Bay (73 degrees 21' N, 80 degrees 32' E) and in the lower reaches of the Uboinaya River (73 degrees 37' N, 82 degrees 10' E), the northwestern Taimyr Peninsula, from 1999 to 2006. All brant nests within 680 m from an owl nest have been regarded as an individual colony. The results show that the area of the colony is always larger than the guarded area around the owl nest. In years of high abundance of lemmings, brant geese nest generally closer to the owl nest than in years of high abundance. When arctic foxes are abundant, however, brant geese nest significantly closer to owls than when the foxes are scarce, irrespective of lemming abundance. The mechanism of brant colony formation around owl nests is based on a number of stimuli.

The short-term impact of herbivores on plant productivity has been well studied. Demonstrating long-term effects of grazing on plant populations is much more difficult, but knowledge of such long-term effects is vital in understanding plant-herbivore interactions. We address this issue in a relatively simple plant herbivore system involving the dark-bellied brent goose Branta bernicla bernicla and two marine macroalgae, Enteromorpha spp. and Ulva lactuca, on which the geese graze. In 3 years of sampling, goose grazing was responsible for depleting between 23% and 60% of the algae in the autumn, while wave damage caused between 15% and 70% depletion. The degree of depletion in autumn had no effect on the biomass of algae present the following summer, suggesting no long-term consequences of grazing for the population dynamics of the algae. A model simulating the change in mean algal biomass over the autumn and winter, incorporating changes due to depletion by geese, wave action and productivity, successfully described the date at which geese abandoned the algal bed in six different years. These years varied in numbers of geese, strength and timing of storms and initial biomass available. The most important factor determining the date of abandonment of the algal bed was a tradeoff between the timing of storms and the numbers of geese. When storms occur early, most depletion is due to wave action and geese must abandon the bed early, regardless of the numbers grazing there. As the algae become depleted, the geese switch to feeding on saltmarsh, pastures or arable crops. The rate of depletion of algae affects the timing of this movement, and the model presented here enables the switch to be predicted.

The present study was conducted to determine whether the two-step time-restricted feeding improves the fattening traits of one-step time-restricted feeding in geese. Thirty-six 8-wk-old geese were allotted into one of three groups. Group R1 (the 1-step restricted feeding group) was allowed access to feed for 2 h in the morning from 8 wk to 14 wk of age. Group R2 (the 2-step restricted feeding group) was treated as Group R1, but was additionally fed for 2 h in the afternoon from 12 wk to 14 wk of age. Group C (the control group) was fed ad libitum from 8 wk to 14 wk of age. Feed intake and body weight (BW) were recorded daily and weekly, respectively. At 14 wk of age, the blood samples were collected to determine the fasting plasma levels of glucose, triacylglycerols and uric acid before sacrifice. The results showed that daily feed intake (DFI) was lower, feed efficiency (FE) was higher in both Groups R1 and R2 than in Group C, and daily gain (DG) in Group R2 was higher than in Group R1 during the whole experimental period (p<0.05). Group R1 exhibited lower abdominal and visceral fat weights in carcass than did Group C (p<0.05), and Group R2 was in intermediate. The fasting plasma glucose levels in Group C were higher, and triacylglycerol levels in Group R1 were higher, compared with the other groups (p<0.05). It is concluded that time-restricted feeding in the fattening period not only increases FE but reduces DFI, and the additional meal during the late fattening period improves the DG without the expense of FE in geese.

As the by-product of cassava, cassava foliage (CF) has been widely used in livestock feed. However, little information is available on its utilization for geese. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of CF on the feed digestion, meat quality, and antioxidative status of geese. A total of 108 male Hainan indigenous geese (28-days-old) with similar body weight were randomly and evenly divided into 3 groups, and the geese were fed for 42 D on either the control diet (CON) consisting of ground maize, soybean meal, and wheat bran, or the experimental diet composed of ground maize, soybean meal, and wheat bran supplemented with 5% (CF1) or 10% (CF2) CF. Dietary nutrient digestibility, physicochemical properties, amino acid and fatty acid composition of meat, and antioxidative status of geese were evaluated. The results showed that supplementation of CF in goose diets enhanced the feed digestion and affected the meat quality. In addition, supplementation of CF had beneficial effects on the regulation of amino acid and fatty acid profiles in muscle tissues. Moreover, such supplementation had no significant effect on antioxidative status. Taken together, goose diet containing 5% CF was recommended based on feed efficiency and meat quality.

Marek's disease virus serotype 1 (MDV-1) strains cause malignant lymphoma in chickens. MDV-1 has been previously reported to be widespread in white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons); however, the prevalence of MDV-1 in other wild birds has not been determined. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of MDV-1 in various wild birds in Hokkaido, Japan. The MDV-1 genome was widespread in geese and ducks, but was not detected in other birds. MDV-1 was detected in both sedentary and migratory species. These results suggest that, in Japan, MDV-1 is widespread in wild goose and duck populations, and that resident ducks may be significant carriers and reservoirs of MDV-1.

Characteristics of the goose hepatitis virus strain SHM 319 were studied in goose embryos and tissue cultures of avian origin. The virus was found to be resistant to both ether and sodium deoxycholate (0.25%). The growth of the virus was inhibited by 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine. Virus infectivity was not affected by heating at 56 degrees C for 3 hours, exposure to pH 3.0, formalin (1:1000), and other inactivating chemicals. Cell culture systems of three avian species were inoculated with GVH-SHM 319. Extensive cytopathic effect was produced only in goose cell cultures. No virus replication was observed in chicken or White Pekin duck cells. Fluorescent antibody staining revealed granular nuclear staining in infected susceptible tissue cultures. May-Grunwald-Giemsa-staining of infected tissue culture cells showed formation of mainly intranuclear inclusion bodies. Millipore filtration procedures revealed a particle size less than 50 nm. Hemagglutination was not observed. Precipitating antibodies could not be detected in GHV hyperimmunized birds. Neutralization tests could not demonstrate a relationship to known viruses of waterfowl, including duck virus enteritis and duck virus hepatitis. A certain discrepancy in the neutralization test with Hungarian goose sera is discussed.

Photoperiod affects poultry reproduction, and in birds, photoperiod regulation is a complex physiological process. In modern poultry production, lighting management has become an important and effective management approach for increasing egg production. Geese are domesticated fowl and in many goose production enterprises animals are allowed to roam in outside pens during the day and are housed indoors at night, so the animals can be exposed to artificial lighting during the night periods. Supplementary artificial lighting resulted in improved reproduction in some studies, but reports have been inconsistent. To evaluate the results from previous studies of supplementary lighting on goose egg production, a meta-analysis was conducted to determine optimal supplementary artificial lighting regimens for geese egg production. Results indicated supplementary artificial light increases mean egg production, the length of the period of egg production before there is cessation of egg production capacity, and fertility. In summary, there were evaluations of data from five studies focused on White Roman geese in the meta-analysis conducted in the present study, however, examination of more breeds is necessary to make more definitive assessments of the findings from this meta-analysis.

Time spent foraging (and in other activities), rate of pecking at food items and length of foraging and nonforaging periods were studied in cackling Canada goose (Branta canadensis minima) goslings during brood-rearing on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska in 1978 and 1979. Brood density on the study area was twice as high in 1978 (23 broods) as in 1979 (12 broods) owing in part to annual variation in nesting density and success. Peck-rates were lower in meadows during 1978 than in 1979. There was no between-year difference in time spent foraging prior to the adult molt (59% of daylight hours) but during molt, goslings spent more time feeding in 1978 (70%) than in 1979 (56%). Prior to the adult molt, 12.2 and 11.9 hours were spent feeding each day in 1978 and 1979 respectively, whereas goslings fed for 13.4 and 10.6 hours daily, in the two years during molting and fledging. Increased foraging time during the molt in 1978 completely compensated for lower peck rates so that total number of pecks per day during this period were similar in 1978 (62,800 pecks/d) and 1979 (57,900 pecks/d). Elsewhere, we reported that cackling geese significantly reduced the availability of their preferred food in 1979 and this food comprised a smaller proportion of the diet in 1978 than 1979. This variation in diet suggests that preferred foods were less available at higher brood densities, resulting in annual variation in foraging behavior. Lengths of foraging periods increased during brood-rearing in both years but were longer on average in 1978. There was no seasonal or between year variation in the length of nonforaging periods. The alternating pattern of foraging and nonforaging periods suggests that rate of processing limits rate of food intake because a relatively constant period of time was regularly required to empty the esophagus before foraging could be resumed. The restriction of food intake by digestive processes increased the importance of dietary nutrient concentrations because low nutrient concentrations could not be compensated for by higher rates of food intake.

In a joint program, Innolytics and the U.S. Department of Agriculture/Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service National Wildlife Research Center collaborated in the development of nicarbazin as an avian contraceptive, initially for resident Canada geese and subsequently for feral pigeons. Unfortunately, the introduction of the original goose product in 2005 was a commercial failure. Political and social barriers effectively thwarted attempts to establish the new technology with any meaningful market success. Although the market adoption of the pigeon contraceptive has been less difficult, the product still encounters significant social and political obstacles and opposition. Given the focus on instant results and gratification, the introduction of contraceptive technology for birds has been challenging and broad market acceptance remains elusive. Nevertheless, especially for short-lived and rapidly reproducing species, customers continue to replace outdated or ineffective techniques with the safer and more effective contraceptive tool.

The fine structure of mitochondria from the ventricular myocardium of canaries, sparrows, zebra finches, quail, and geese has been studied. The first three of these birds have very fast heart rates, the quail being intermediate, and the goose has a relatively slow rate. The canary heart has a unique form of mitochondrion containing large, parallel arrays of zigzag or angled cristae. Other cristae, continuous with the zigzag ones and also occupying large parts of the mitochondrial volume, are named retiform because of the hexagonal network which they form, sometimes in a single plane and sometimes three dimensional. These two types of cristae appear to be interconnectible. It is possible that there is a direct functional significance in these peculiar forms, but, in any case, the relative constancy of dimensions in these arrays is probably related to specific properties of the molecules of which the cristal membrane is composed. It is also demonstrated that this membrane is composed in part of approximately 30-A particles which are believed to be protein molecules. This unusual mitochondrial morphology is not seen either in the other fast bird hearts or in the slower ones, so that there is neither a simple correlation with heart rate nor probably with the separate parts of the cardiac cycle. Although none of the other four hearts shows more than an occasional angled crista, there does seem to be a rather gross correlation between heart rate and mitochondrial size and complexity of crista structure, but no correlation with presence or absence of zigzag forms. The cristae of quail heart mitochondria are disposed in unusually large close-packed whorls.

We examined the role of trophic interactions in structuring a high arctic tundra community characterized by a large breeding colony of greater snow geese (Chen caerulescens atlantica). According to the exploitation ecosystem hypothesis of Oksanen et al. (1981), food chains are controlled by top-down interactions. However, because the arctic primary productivity is low, herbivore populations are too small to support functional predator populations and these communities should thus be dominated by the plant/ herbivore trophic-level interaction. Since 1990, we have been monitoring annual abundance and productivity of geese, the impact of goose grazing, predator abundance (mostly arctic foxes, Alopex lagopus) and the abundance of lemmings, the other significant herbivore in this community, on Bylot Island, Nunavut, Canada. Goose grazing consistently removed a significant proportion of the standing crop (∼40%) in tundra wetlands every year. Grazing changed plant community composition and reduced the production of grasses and sedges to a low-level equilibrium compared to the situation where the presence of geese had been removed. Lemming cyclic fluctuations were strong and affected fox reproduction. Fox predation on goose eggs was severe and generated marked annual variation in goose productivity. Predation intensity on geese was closely related to the lemming cycle, a consequence of an indirect interaction between lemming and geese via shared predators. We conclude that, contrary to the exploitation ecosystem hypothesis, both the plant/herbivore and predator/prey interactions are significant in this arctic community.

Social dominance plays an important role in assessing and obtaining access to patchy or scarce food sources in group-foraging herbivores. We investigated the foraging strategies of individuals with respect to their social position in the group in a flock of nonbreeding, moulting barnacle geese, Branta leucopsis, on high Arctic Spitsbergen. We first determined the dominance rank of individually marked birds. The dominance of an individual was best described by its age and its sex-specific body mass. Mating status explained the large variation in dominance among younger birds, as unpaired yearlings ranked lowest. In an artificially created, competitive situation, subordinate individuals occupied explorative front positions in the flock and were the first to find sites with experimentally enriched vegetation. Nevertheless, they were displaced quickly from these favourable sites by more dominant geese which were able to monopolize them. The enhanced sites were subsequently visited preferentially by individuals that succeeded in feeding there when the exclosures were first opened. Data on walking speed of foraging individuals and nearest-neighbour distances in the group suggest that subordinates try to compensate for a lower energy intake by exploring and by lengthening the foraging bout. Observations of our focal birds during the following breeding season revealed that females that returned to the study area were significantly more dominant in the previous year than those not seen in the area again.

The aim of the study was to compare the carcass and meat quality of geese fed with soybean meal or yellow lupin. In total, 210 White Kołuda® geese were divided into 2 groups (1, soybean meal (SBM); 2, yellow lupin (YL), potato protein, and brewer's yeast) of 5 replications (21 birds per each). After 16 weeks, 10 geese (5 females, 5 males) from each group were slaughtered. Carcass dissection was done, and major physicochemical traits were analysed (pH, water holding capacity, drip loss, color, and chemical composition of muscles). Weight of leg muscles and their proportion in the carcass were higher (p < 0.05) in SBM. Breast muscles from SBM were characterized by increased (p < 0.05) drip loss, enhanced (p < 0.05) content of protein, water, collagen and connective tissue, and lower (p < 0.05) fat content. Leg muscles from SBM were characterized by higher (p < 0.05) protein and water content but decreased (p < 0.05) salt and fat content compared to YL. The addition of YL (approx. 28%), potato protein, and brewer's yeast had no negative effect on most meat traits and could partly replace SBM as a protein source in geese feeding. Hence, yellow lupin, potato protein and brewer's yeast can be used in geese rearing followed by fattening with oats. Some producers do not have the option of using soybean meal. Small-scale farms use their own crop resources, so lupins can be an alternative source of protein for soybean meal.

The evolution of thorn-like structures in plants on oceanic islands that lack mammalian and reptilian herbivores is puzzling, as is their tendency toward juvenile-adult leaf dimorphism. We propose that these traits arose in Cyanea (Campanulaceae) on Hawaii as mechanical and visual defenses against herbivory by flightless geese and goose-like ducks that were extirpated by Polynesians within the last 1600 years. A chloroplast DNA phylogeny indicates that thorn-like prickles evolved at least four times and leaf dimorphism at least three times during the last 3.7 million years. The incidence of both traits increases from Oahu eastward toward younger islands, paralleling the distribution of avian species apparently adapted for browsing. The effectiveness of visual defenses against avian browsers (once dominant on many oceanic islands, based on the vagility of their ancestors) may provide a general explanation for insular heterophylly: the other islands on which this previously unexplained phenomenon is marked (New Zealand, New Caledonia, Madagascar, Mascarene Islands) are exactly those on which one or more large flightless avian browsers evolved.

Since human-wildlife conflicts are increasing, the development of cost-effective methods for reducing damage or conflict levels is important in wildlife management. A wide range of devices to detect and deter animals causing conflict are used for this purpose, although their effectiveness is often highly variable, due to habituation to disruptive or disturbing stimuli. Automated recognition of behaviours could form a critical component of a system capable of altering the disruptive stimuli to avoid this. In this paper we present a novel method to automatically recognise goose behaviour based on vocalisations from flocks of free-living barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis). The geese were observed and recorded in a natural environment, using a shielded shotgun microphone. The classification used Support Vector Machines (SVMs), which had been trained with labeled data. Greenwood Function Cepstral Coefficients (GFCC) were used as features for the pattern recognition algorithm, as they can be adjusted to the hearing capabilities of different species. Three behaviours are classified based in this approach, and the method achieves a good recognition of foraging behaviour (86-97% sensitivity, 89-98% precision) and a reasonable recognition of flushing (79-86%, 66-80%) and landing behaviour(73-91%, 79-92%). The Support Vector Machine has proven to be a robust classifier for this kind of classification, as generality and non-linear capabilities are important. We conclude that vocalisations can be used to automatically detect behaviour of conflict wildlife species, and as such, may be used as an integrated part of a wildlife management system.

Seasonal changes in the distribution and feeding behaviour of dark-bellied brent geese Branta b. bernicla (L.) and the biomass of their food plants were studied in three successive winters on the Norfolk coast. The data was used, in conjunction with published information, to show how depletion, productivity and mortality of food plants drive the pattern of habitat switching in this species. It is then possible to explain the habitat shifts observed over the last 35 years and predict future changes. On arrival, geese fed first on algal beds and then on salt marsh, grass and arable fields before returning to feed entirely on the salt marsh in spring. The biomass of green algae, and subsequently the salt marsh vegetation, declined during the autumn and this could be attributed to depletion through goose grazing and natural mortality. As depletion occurred the geese fed more intensively, for a greater percentage of time and with an increasing pace rate, the net result, however, was a declining intake rate (as measured by defaecation rate). The algal biomass at which the geese switched from the algal beds to salt marsh was consistent between years, with heavy storm-induced loss of algae in one year resulting in an earlier switch. That the timing of habitat switches may be explained by depletion of food plants was further supported by historical data: the number of brent geese wintering at the site has increased dramatically over the last 30-35 years and the time of switching from algal beds to salt marsh and from salt marsh to salt marsh and fields has become progressively earlier, as expected from the increased depletion. The expected further increase in brent goose numbers will increase the rate of depletion of intertidal vegetation so that the switches between habitats will be more rapid and the geese will move inland earlier and remain inland longer. The expected increase in the brent goose population will thus result in a disproportionate increase in the levels of conflict between brent geese and agriculture.

1. This study aimed to investigate effects of dietary fibre and grit on growth performance, gastrointestinal tract development, and gizzard grit retention of geese.2. The trial had a 3 × 2 factorial design consisting of three levels of dietary crude fibre (CF, 4%, 7% and 10%, adjusted by grass powder), with or without grit addition (1-4 mm river sand).3. In total, 648, 22-d-old male goslings were randomly allotted to six treatments (six pens/treatment). At 49 d and 70 d of age, one goose per pen was euthanised to collect samples.4. The birds fed 10% CF had decreased feed conversion ratio (FCR) during 22-49 d, but this effect was less in older geese. Increasing dietary CF levels increased relative weights of gizzards for geese aged 49 d and 70 d. While, grit addition decreased the relative weights of gizzard and duodenum of geese aged 49 d. The gizzard of geese could selectively retain grit from feed even with no grit added. With adequate supply, most grit in gizzard was 0.45-3 mm in size.5. In conclusion, supplement of CF and grit mainly affected gastrointestinal tract, and the amount of CF affected FCR. Geese aged 22-49 d could utilise dietary CF levels of 4%-7% and older birds could feed on diets with up to 10% CF. The gizzard of goose selectively retained grit of a particle size of 0.45-3mm.

We examined whether host traits influenced the occurrence of avian influenza virus (AIV) in Anatidae (ducks, geese, swans) at wintering sites in California's Central Valley. In total, 3487 individuals were sampled at Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge and Conaway Ranch Duck Club during the hunting season of 2007-08. Of the 19 Anatidae species sampled, prevalence was highest in the northern shoveler (5.09%), followed by the ring-necked duck (2.63%), American wigeon (2.57%), bufflehead (2.50%), greater white-fronted goose (2.44%), and cinnamon teal (1.72%). Among host traits, density of lamellae (filtering plates) of dabbling ducks was significantly associated with AIV prevalence and the number of subtypes shed by the host, suggesting that feeding methods may influence exposure to viral particles.

Ammonia volatilization losses from faeces of Lesser Snow Geese were measured during the summer of 1987 on the salt-marsh flats at La Pérouse Bay. Amounts of ammonia volatilized increased with increasing ambient temperature, and ranged from 1.0 to 15.1 mg N per 100 mg of nitrogen present as soluble ammonium ions at the start of the 8-h experiment. Using estimates of faecal deposition reported previously, the annual loss via volatilization was estimated at 0.08 g N m-2, or 7.9% of the nitrogen present in goose faeces. Percent change in soluble ammonium ions in fresh faeces after 8 h ranged from -51.1% to +41.1%, indicating that net mineralization of organic nitrogen occurred in some of the faeces. Microbial respiration of fresh goose faeces increased exponentially with temperature. However, variable rates of net mineralization per unit rate of respiration indicated that the substrate quality affected microbial immobilization and thus net nitrogen mineralization. In feeding experiments, captive goslings grazed different types of vegetation, each with distinctive nutritional qualities. Forage quality had significant effects on goose feeding behavior and subsequent rates of nitrogen mineralization in fresh faeces. Net nitrogen mineralization rates in faeces from geese which grazed the three vegetation types ranged from 1.31 to 4.97 mg NH 4+ -N gDW-1 24 h-1. Because plant growth in this salt marsh is nitrogen-limited, where swards are grazed, mineralization of organic faecal nitrogen represents an essential link in the maintenance of the flow of nitrogen into the sediments and the sustained growth of vegetation at a time when most required by the geese.

Microorganisms in vertebrate guts have been recognized as important symbionts influencing host life. However, it remains unclear about the gut microbiota in long-distance migratory Anseriformes herbivores, which could be functionally important for these wetland-dependent animals. We collected faeces of the greater white-fronted goose (GWFG), bean goose (BG) and swan goose (SG) from Shengjin Lake (SJL) and Poyang Lake (PYL) in the Yangtze River Floodplain, China. High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA V4 region was employed to depict the composition and structure of geese gut microbiota during wintering period. The dominant bacterial phyla across all samples were Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, but significant variations were detected among different goose species and sampling sites, in terms of α diversity, community structures and microbial interactions. We found a significant correlation between diet and the microbial community structure in GWFG-SJL samples. These results demonstrated that host species and diet are potential drivers of goose gut microbiota assemblies. Despite these variations, functions of geese gut microbiota were similar, with great abundances of potential genes involved in nutrient metabolism. This preliminary study would be valuable for future, exhaustive investigations of geese gut microbiota and their interactions with host.

The effects of simulated goose grazing on Phleum pratense plants were tested in an Iceland hayfield during the spring goose staging period (19 April-11 May 1997). Plants in an area exclosed from the influence of grazing and the nutrient effects of goose faeces were subject to the removal of the youngest lamina once, three and four times during this period. Clipping three and four times resulted in 25-41% increases in cumulative elongation of youngest laminae compared with unclipped plants. Total cumulative lamina growth of entire plants showed no significant difference between unclipped plants and those clipped three and four times, hence no overcompensation occurred. Sequential clipping elevated the protein content of the youngest laminae from 20% to 27-33%, whereas there was no change amongst shoots clipped only once. Because geese only consume the youngest lamina of each Phleum plant, measurements from this experiment showed that regular physical removal of growing biomass doubled the biomass of preferred tissue available to geese and increased the potential protein intake 3.5 times at experimental clipping frequencies similar to levels of sequential harvesting observed amongst staging geese compared to less frequent harvesting. These increases were achieved without any fertilising effects of goose faeces implicated in such effects in previous studies.

Variation in fitness between individuals in populations may be attributed to differing environmental conditions experienced among birth (or hatch) years (i.e., between cohorts). In this study, we tested whether cohort fitness could also be explained by environmental conditions experienced in years post-hatch, using 736 lifelong resighting histories of Greenland white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons flavirostris) marked in their first winter. Specifically, we tested whether variation in age at first successful reproduction, the size of the first successful brood and the proportion of successful breeders by cohort was explained by environmental conditions experienced on breeding areas in west Greenland during hatch year, those in adulthood prior to successful reproduction and those in the year of successful reproduction, using North Atlantic Oscillation indices as proxies for environmental conditions during these periods. Fifty-nine (8%) of all marked birds reproduced successfully (i.e., were observed on wintering areas with young) only once in their lifetime and 15 (2%) reproduced successfully twice or thrice. Variation in age at first successful reproduction was explained by the environmental conditions experienced during adulthood in the years prior to successful reproduction. Birds bred earliest (mean age 4) when environmental conditions were 'good' prior to the year of successful reproduction. Conversely, birds successfully reproduced at older ages (mean age 7) if they experienced adverse conditions prior to the year of successful reproduction. Hatch year conditions and an interaction between those experienced prior to and during the year of successful reproduction explained less (marginally significant) variation in age at first successful reproduction. Environmental conditions did not explain variation in the size of the first successful brood or the proportion of successful breeders. These findings show that conditions during adulthood prior to the year of successful reproduction are most important in determining the age at first successful reproduction in Greenland white-fronted geese. Very few birds bred successfully at all (most only once), which suggests that May environmental conditions on breeding areas have cohort effects that influence lifetime (and not just annual) reproductive success.

The aim of the study was to determine the level of gastrointestinal parasites in a native breed of geese - Zatorska goose - based on coproscopic testing. Faecal samples were collected from 90 young geese in three age groups (5, 7 and 9 weeks old) in 2014. The geese were kept indoors on deep litter and pastured from spring to autumn. The area of the pastures around the buildings where the geese grazed was about 1 hectare, divided into quarters for different age groups. Before grazing, the birds were dewormed with fenbendazole (Fenbenat powder 4%, Naturan). As additional treatment for coccidiosis, coccidiostats were added to the feed. The study was conducted using the McMaster quantitative method with centrifugation (flotation liquid: NaCl and glucose). The birds were shown to be infected with coccidia and nematodes. The prevalence of Eimeria sp. infection (mean 40%) and the number of oocysts per gram of faeces (reaching 5,300 OPG) were highest in the youngest age group of geese. The level of Amidostomum anseris infection was similar in the three age groups, with prevalence from 40% to 50% (nematode egg output ranged from 50 to 350 eggs per gram of faeces, EPG). Capillaria anatis was observed only in 5- and 7-week-old geese.

A number of experiments were done with a strain of goose hepatitis virus (isolated from sick goslings in the Netherlands in 1969. This virus was easily grown in embryonating eggs of the Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata) as well as in embryonating goose eggs. It also proved possible to adapt it to White Pekin duck eggs. The susceptibility of embryonating eggs obtained by crossing Muscovy drakes with Pekin ducks was intermediate between that of eggs from the two parental breeds. It was not possible to adapt goose hepatitis virus to growth in chicken embryos. The sensitivity of goslings to the goose hepatitis virus was found to vary considerably according to the farms from which they came. These differences were caused by variations 'in the quantity of parentally derived antibodies. One day-old Muscovy ducklings appeared to be at least as sensitive to the virus as goslings. However, disease symptoms could not be produced with goose hepatitis virus in Pekin ducklings nor in ducklings obtained by crossing Muscovy drakes and Pekin ducks. Treatment with homologous immune serum protected susceptible goslings and Muscovy ducklings against the disease. Under farm conditions, mortality was reduced from 30 to 3%. A breeding flock of adult Muscovy ducks, which had by serum therapy survived a goose hepatitis infection at an early age, produced ducklings resistant to the goose hepatitis virus. Over 100 flocks of geese, totalling more than 6,000 birds, were actively immunized with goose hepatitis Virus. The progeny produced in the following breeding season resisted, almost without exception, a challenge at one day of age with virulent goose hepatitis virus.

Detección y caracterización molecular de dos genotipos del parvovirus del ganso aislados de gansos en período de crecimiento y de patos Cherry Valley en China. El parvovirus del ganso (GPV) es el patógeno etiológico de la enfermedad de Derzsy, que causa grandes pérdidas económicas en la industria de las aves acuáticas. Un nuevo virus relacionado con el parvovirus del ganso (NGPV), que causó el síndrome de pico corto y enanismo, se ha presentado en China desde el año 2015. En este estudio, se aislaron dos cepas de parvovirus del ganso (RC45 y RC70) a partir de gansos enfermos en período de crecimiento (45 días de edad y 70 días) y se aisló una cepa del nuevo virus relacionado con el parvovirus del ganso, cepa GXN45 a partir de un pato Cherry Valley de 45 días de edad en China. Para comprender mejor la diversidad genética entre los aislamientos del parvovirus del ganso de aves acuáticas en período de crecimiento y de otros parvovirus clásicos de aves acuáticas, se secuenciaron y analizaron los genomas completos y los genes principales. Las alineaciones de secuencias genómicas completas demostraron que tanto RC45 como RC70 mostraron la identidad más alta con los parvovirus de ganso clásicos cepas YZ99-6 y SHFX1201, mientras que la cepa GXN45 compartió la identidad más alta con nuevo virus relacionado con el parvovirus del ganso cepa SDLC01. La alineación de la secuencia de la región repetida invertida terminal mostró que las cepas GXN45, RC45 y RC70 tenían dos deleciones de 14 nucleótidos (nt) en comparación con la cepa B clásica virulenta del parvovirus del ganso y una deleción de 14 nucleótidos en comparación con la cepa M15 de un virus nuevo relacionado con el parvovirus del ganso originado en patos mula. El análisis del árbol filogenético de los genes no estructurales y VP1 mostró que la cepa GXN45 se agrupó en una rama con la cepa QH15 del nuevo virus relacionado con el parvovirus del ganso, excepto en el árbol de aminoácidos de VP1. Aunque tanto RC45 como RC70 formaron una rama separada distinta de los aislados de parvovirus de ganso clásicos, estaban en una rama de árbol filogenética grande. Este estudio contribuirá a una mejor comprensión de la diversidad genética y en la caracterización molecular de tres aislamientos de parvovirus aislados y contribuirá con las bases para seguir estudiando la relación entre las mutaciones del genoma del virus y la patogenicidad viral.

In November 1997, an outbreak of a neuroparalytic disease caused by West Nile (WN) virus was diagnosed in young goose flocks. Domestic geese were similarly affected in the late summer and fall of 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001. WN viruses were also isolated from migratory and wild birds and horses in 1998-2001. A 1278 bp sequence of the envelope gene of 24 Israeli WN virus isolates was compared with those of seven isolates from Africa, Europe and New York. As a result, the Israeli isolates could then be grouped into two clusters. The 15 avian and three equine from 1997-2001 in the first cluster of viruses were shown to be identical to WN-NY99, while the second cluster comprised one goose isolate from 1998 and two goose and two pigeon isolates from 2000. These closely resembled the most recent Old World isolates, and indicate that at least two WN genotypes were co-circulating in the region during this time.

Huoyan goose is a Chinese local breed famous for its higher laying performance, but the problems of variety degeneration have emerged recently, especially a decrease in the number of eggs laid. In order to better understand the molecular mechanism that underlies egg laying in Huoyan geese, gene profiles in the pituitary gland of Huoyan geese taken during the laying period and ceased period were investigated using the suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) method. Total RNA was extracted from pituitary glands of ceased period and laying period geese. The cDNA in the pituitary glands of ceased geese was subtracted from the cDNA in the pituitary glands of laying geese (forward subtraction); the reverse subtraction was also performed. After sequencing and annotation, a total of 30 and 24 up and down-regulated genes were obtained from the forward and reverse SSH libraries, respectively. These genes mostly related to biosynthetic process, cellular nitrogen compound metabolic process, transport, cell differentiation, cellular protein modification process, signal transduction, small molecule metabolic process. Furthermore, eleven genes were selected for further analyses by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The qRT-PCR results for the most part were consistent with the SSH results. Among these genes, Synaptotagmin-1 (SYT1) and Stathmin-2 (STMN2) were substantially over-expressed in laying period compared to ceased period. These results could serve as an important reference for elucidating the molecular mechanism of higher laying performance in Huoyan geese.

1. The present study was conducted to obtain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying broodiness in a commercial breed, Tianfu geese, as little is known about the role of the pineal gland in this period. The aim was to identify genes which are differentially expressed in the pineal gland between the laying and broodiness periods by performing a transcriptome screen.2. After sequencing cDNA derived from the pineal gland and annotation of the results, a sequencing depth of 14.82 and 18.17 million mapped tags was obtained during the laying and broodiness periods, respectively, and a total of 120 differentially expressed genes were identified. Of these, 32 genes showing up-regulated expression and 88 genes showing down-regulated expression were identified in broodiness period vs. laying period libraries.3. Gene ontology (GO) analyses showed that these genes were related to the visual process, phototransduction, and lipoprotein metabolism. Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) analyses showed that phototransduction and tryptophan metabolism pathways exhibited the largest enrichment factors. The reliability of the RNA sequence data was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR analysis of five genes, and the results were mostly consistent with those from the high-throughput RNA sequencing.4. The goose transcriptome and the identification of differentially expressed genes provided comprehensive gene expression information that enables a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the broodiness period of geese.

There are many large, easy-to-observe anseriform birds (ducks, geese, and swans) in northern Australia and New Guinea and they often gather in large numbers. Yet, the structure of their populations and their regional movements are poorly understood. Lack of understanding of population structure limits our capacity to understand source-sink dynamics relevant to their conservation or assess risks associated with avian-borne pathogens, in particular, avian influenza for which waterfowl are the main reservoir species. We set out to assess present-day genetic connectivity between populations of two widely distributed waterfowl in the Australo-Papuan tropics, magpie goose Anseranas semipalmata (Latham, 1798) and wandering whistling-duck Dendrocygna arcuata (Horsfield, 1824). Microsatellite data were obtained from 237 magpie geese and 64 wandering whistling-duck. Samples were collected across northern Australia, and at one site each in New Guinea and Timor Leste. In the wandering whistling-duck, genetic diversity was significantly apportioned by region and sampling location. For this species, the best model of population structure was New Guinea as the source population for all other populations. One remarkable result for this species was genetic separation of two flocks sampled contemporaneously on Cape York Peninsula only a few kilometers apart. In contrast, evidence for population structure was much weaker in the magpie goose, and Cape York as the source population provided the best fit to the observed structure. The fine scale genetic structure observed in wandering whistling-duck and magpie goose is consistent with earlier suggestions that the west-coast of Cape York Peninsula is a flyway for Australo-Papuan anseriforms between Australia and New Guinea across Torres Strait.

We investigated a reproductive flock of Zatorska geese. The birds were divided into four groups: three-year-old ganders (n=10), and one-, two-, and three-year-old layers (n=30). Mature feathers were collected from the birds between July and September (i.e., after breeding). Before collection, the feathers and down were evaluated to determine their maturity. The quantitative composition of each sample of feathers was evaluated manually. The evaluated quality traits of the feathers were turbidity of an aqueous extract, acidity, oxygen index number, and fat content. The data were analyzed using the SAS statistical package with multivariate analysis of variance for repeated measures. The weight of feathers collected from all three gatherings was the highest for the three-year-old ganders. In subsequent gatherings, the weight of the collected feathers tended to increase. There was a statistically significant difference in down composition between the first and the subsequent two gatherings in all age-groups of geese. Neither the age nor the gender of the birds had an effect on the quantity of down obtained, which was 80-85 g. The turbidity of the feather extract was lowest for feathers collected in the first gathering. For the layers, the turbidity of the feather extract was lowest in feathers obtained from the one-year-old birds. The feathers ranged from slightly acidic to neutral, with pH values between 5.9 and 7.2. The fat content was lowest in feathers collected in the first gathering (2.4-2.7%), and tended to increase in subsequent gatherings. There was no statistically significant difference in the oxygen index number between individual gatherings, or between the three-years-old layers and the ganders.

Good phylogenetic trees are required to test hypotheses about evolutionary processes. We report four new avian mitochondrial genomes, which together with an improved method of phylogenetic analysis for vertebrate mt genomes give results for three questions in avian evolution. The new mt genomes are: magpie goose (Anseranas semipalmata), an owl (morepork, Ninox novaeseelandiae); a basal passerine (rifleman, or New Zealand wren, Acanthisitta chloris); and a parrot (kakapo or owl-parrot, Strigops habroptilus). The magpie goose provides an important new calibration point for avian evolution because the well-studied Presbyornis fossils are on the lineage to ducks and geese, after the separation of the magpie goose. We find, as with other animal mitochondrial genomes, that RY-coding is helpful in adjusting for biases between pyrimidines and between purines. When RY-coding is used at third positions of the codon, the root occurs between paleognath and neognath birds (as expected from morphological and nuclear data). In addition, passerines form a relatively old group in Neoaves, and many modern avian lineages diverged during the Cretaceous. Although many aspects of the avian tree are stable, additional taxon sampling is required.

The complete genome of a novel coronavirus was sequenced directly from the cloacal swab of a Canada goose that perished in a die-off of Canada and Snow geese in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, Canada. Comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis indicate it is a new species of Gammacoronavirus, as it falls below the threshold of 90% amino acid similarity in the protein domains used to demarcate Coronaviridae. Additional features that distinguish the genome of Canada goose coronavirus include 6 novel ORFs, a partial duplication of the 4 gene and a presumptive change in the proteolytic processing of polyproteins 1a and 1ab.

The parasite Cryptosporidium parvum represents a threat to livestock health and production, water quality and public health. Cattle are known to be significant reservoirs of C. parvum, but transmission routes are complex and recent studies have implicated the potential role of wildlife in parasite transmission to cattle and water sources. On the Orkney Isles, high densities of Greylag geese (Anser anser) cause widespread faecal contamination of cattle pastures, where cryptosporidiosis is known to be the main cause of neonatal calf diarrhoea and Cryptosporidium contamination frequently occurs in two reservoirs supplying Mainland Orkney's public water. This study aimed to determine the Cryptosporidium species and subtypes present in geese and calves co-grazing on four farms surrounding two reservoirs on Mainland Orkney. Results indicated a high level of C. parvum prevalence in calves, geese and water samples. gp60 analysis illustrated that higher genotypic diversity was present in the goose population compared with calves, but did not yield sequence results for any of the water samples. It can be concluded that the high levels of C. parvum evident in calves, geese and water samples tested represents a significant risk to water quality and public health.

We analyzed 155,535 samples collected for surveillance of avian influenza viruses (AIVs), in the United States from 2007 to 2009, from migratory waterfowl (ducks, geese, and swans). The goal was to elucidate patterns of prevalence by flyway and functional groups to determine targets for future surveillance. Apparent prevalence of AIV was highest in the Pacific Flyway in 2007-2008 (14.2% and 14.1%, respectively), in the Mississippi Flyway in 2009 (16.8%), and lowest each year in the Atlantic Flyway (range, 7.3%-8.9%). Dabbling ducks had higher apparent prevalence of AIV (12.8%-18.8%) than diving ducks (3.9%-6.0%) or geese and swans (3.6%-3.9%). We observed highest apparent prevalence in hatch-year waterfowl (15.6%-18.9%). We further analyzed 117,738 of the 155,535 samples to test the hypothesis mallard (Anasplatyrhynchos) had highest prevalence of AIV. We compared apparent prevalence and odds ratios for seven species of ducks and one species of goose commonly collected across the United States. Mallards had highest apparent prevalence (15%-26%) in half of comparisons made, whereas American green- winged teal (Anas creeca, 12%-13%), blue-winged teal (Anas discors, 13%-23%), northern pintail (Anas acuta, 16%-22%), or northern shoveler (Anas clypeata, 15%) had higher apparent prevalence in the remaining comparisons. The results of our research can be used to tailor future surveillance that targets flyways, functional groups, and species with the highest probability of detecting AIV.

Infections caused by thermotolerant Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. are the leading causes of human gastroenteritis worldwide. Wild birds can act as reservoirs of both pathogens. A survey was carried out to determine the prevalence, genetic diversity and antimicrobial resistance of thermotolerant Campylobacter and Salmonella in waterfowl used as decoys and wild raptors in Andalusia (Southern Spain). The overall prevalence detected for Campylobacter was 5.9% (18/306; CI95%: 3.25-8.52) in decoys and 2.3% (9/387; CI95%: 0.82-3.83) in wild raptors. Isolates were identified as C. jejuni, C. coli and C. lari in both bird groups. Salmonella was isolated in 3.3% (10/306; CI95%: 2.3-4.3) and 4.6% (18/394; CI95%: 3.5-5.6) of the decoys and raptors, respectively. Salmonella Enteritidis and Typhimurium were the most frequently identified serovars, although Salmonella serovars Anatum, Bredeney, London and Mikawasima were also isolated. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis of isolates showed higher genetic diversity within Campylobacter species compared to Salmonella serovars. Campylobacter isolates showed resistance to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and tetracycline, while resistance to erythromycin and tetracycline was found in Salmonella isolates. The results indicate that both decoys and raptors can act as natural carriers of Campylobacter and Salmonella in Spain, which may have important implications for public and animal health.

Genetic studies on protected species can be difficult, particularly when they form a mixed-species flock with other species. The bean goose (Anser fabalis), which is internationally recognized as a threatened species, was observed to form overwintering foraging flocks with white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons) at agricultural lands to feed on the grains in Korea. Non-invasive samples such as feces and feather that are readily available in their foraging ground can be useful for understanding the structure and composition of populations, but they often require specific experimental conditions due to small amount or low quality of DNA. In this study, we designed sets of primers that would allow efficient molecular identification of species and sex of individuals of bean geese and white-fronted geese. Species-specific primers (WFG-F/BG-F and G-R), developed from ND2 region of mitochondrial DNA, produced PCR products with different sizes which allow easy species identification without further sequencing. Based on published CHD 1 sequences, we designed internal primers (Gsex-F and Gsex-R) for sex determination that can be used in nested PCR after applying P2/P8 primers, and our methods clearly showed high success rate of molecular sexing from non-invasive samples. These molecular tools open the possibilities for genetic studies using non-invasive samples collected from a mixed-species aggregation containing bean geese and white-fronted geese.

We surveyed free-ranging Canada Geese (Branta canadensis), Trumpeter Swans (Cygnus buccinator), Mute Swans (Cygnus olor), and Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) to estimate the prevalence of antibodies to avian bornavirus (ABV) and of cloacal shedding of ABV RNA in southern Ontario, Canada. Blood samples and cloacal swabs were collected from 206 free-ranging Canada Geese, 135 Trumpeter Swans, 75 Mute Swans, and 208 Mallards at 10 main capture sites between October 2010 and May 2012. Sera were assessed for antibodies against ABV by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and swabs were evaluated for ABV RNA using real-time reverse-transcription PCR. Serum antibodies were detected in birds from all four species and at each sampling site. Thirteen percent of the geese caught on the Toronto Zoo site shed ABV RNA in feces compared with 0% in geese sampled at three other locations. The proportions of shedders among Mute Swans, Trumpeter Swans, and Mallards were 9%, 0%, and 0%, respectively. Birds that were shedding viral RNA were more likely to have antibodies against ABV and to have higher antibody levels than those that were not, although many birds with antibodies were not shedding. We confirmed that exposure to, or infection with, ABV is widespread in asymptomatic free-ranging waterfowl in Canada; however, the correlation between cloacal shedding, presence of antibodies, and presence of disease is not fully understood.

δ-Crystallin is a taxon-specific eye lens protein that was recruited from argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) through gene sharing. ASL is a metabolic enzyme that catalyzes the reversible conversion of argininosuccinate into arginine and fumarate and shares about 70% sequence identity and similar overall topology with δ-crystallin. ASL has a lower thermal stability than δ-crystallin. In this study, we show that the small heat shock protein, αA-crystallin, functions as a molecular chaperone, and enhanced thermal stability of both δ-crystallin and ASL. The stoichiometry for efficient protection of the two substrate proteins by αA-crystallin was determined by slowly increasing the temperature. N- or C-terminal truncated mutants of δ-crystallin co-incubated with αA-crystallin showed higher thermal stability than wild-type enzyme, and the stoichiometry for efficient protection was the same. Thermal unfolding of δ-crystallin or ASL in the presence of αA-crystallin followed a similar three-state model, as determined by circular dichroism analyses. A stable intermediate which retained about 30% α-helical structure was observed. Protection from thermal denaturation by αA-crystallin was by interaction with partly unfolded ASL or δ-crystallin to form high molecular weight heteroligomers, as judged by size-exclusive chromatography and SDS-PAGE analyses. Aggregate formation of ASL was significantly reduced in the presence of αA-crystallin. The extent of protection of ASL and δ-crystallin at different ratios of αA-crystallin were described by hyperbolic and sigmoidal curves, respectively. These results suggest the preferential recognition of partly unfolded ASL by αA-crystallin. In contrast, unstable δ-crystallin might trigger a cooperative interaction by higher stoichiometries of αA-crystallin leading to fuller protection. The different interactions of αA-crystallin with the two homologous but functionally different substrate proteins show its behavior as a chaperone is variable.

The aggregative responses and habitat preferences of a generalist herbivore, the dark-bellied brent goose Branta bernicla bernicla, feeding on salt marshes are examined in relation to vegetation community characteristics and the abundances of individual plant species. In the autumn, feeding was strongly concentrated on the low marsh, which had the highest biomass of the preferred food plant, Salicornia europaea. There was a strong aggregative response of the geese to the abundance of S. europaea. A decline in the availability of S. europaea led to an increase in the pattern of aggregation in relation to the two other major food plants on the low marsh, Aster tripolium and Puccinellia maritima. The availability of these food plants, however, reached critically low levels in mid-winter and the geese abandoned the low marsh for the high marsh. Within the high marsh, the plant communities selected tended to be dominated by the inedible species Limonium vulgare. The food plants selected were P. maritima in the winter and P. maritima and Triglochinmaritimum in the spring. On the high marsh, aggregative responses were shown to both P. maritima and T. maritimum, but in both cases, aggregation increased up to a critical level of biomass, and then declined. The prevention of grazing with exclosures for 3 years led to an increase in the abundance of P. maritima on both high and low marshes. This change was slight on high marsh but pronounced on low marsh, where S. europaea showed a decrease in abundance in the exclosures over this time. The implications of the aggregative responses for the population dynamics of P. maritima and S. europaea are discussed.

Fungi of the genus Paecilomyces, a causative agent of the fungal disease paecilomycosis, have been found in the blood of productive animals (sheep, cattle, pigs, goats) that are carriers of Echinococcus larvocysts. In the Republic of Uzbekistan, the echinococcosis affection of sheep, cattle, pigs, and goats continues to remain high. Domestic fowls (chickens, turkeys, and gooses) have been established to be blood carriers of Paecilomyces fungi, which is also true for wild birds, such as my-lady's-belts, quails, chukars, and crows. The degree of fungal affection has been also established for birds.

Trade-offs between locomotory costs and foraging gains are key elements in determining constraints on predator-prey interactions. One intriguing example involves polar bears pursuing snow geese on land. As climate change forces polar bears to spend more time ashore, they may need to expend more energy to obtain land-based food. Given that polar bears are inefficient at terrestrial locomotion, any extra energy expended to pursue prey could negatively impact survival. However, polar bears have been regularly observed engaging in long pursuits of geese and other land animals, and the energetic worth of such behaviour has been repeatedly questioned. We use data-driven energetic models to examine how energy expenditures vary across polar bear mass and speed. For the first time, we show that polar bears in the 125-235 kg size range can profitably pursue geese, especially at slower speeds. We caution, however, that heat build-up may be the ultimate limiting factor in terrestrial chases, especially for larger bears, and this limit would be reached more quickly with warmer environmental temperatures.

Morphological and genetic analyses were performed on seven species of the family Capillariidae (Nematoda: Trichocephalida: Trichinelloidea), viz. Eucoleus perforans, Eucoleus contortus, Aonchotheca bursata, Baruscapillaria obsignata, Capillaria anatis, Capillaria phasianina, and Capillaria spinulosa, detected in poultry from Japan and Indonesia. Two Eucoleus spp., perforating the esophageal mucosa of the Japanese green pheasant farmed in Japan (E. perforans) and domestic goose in Indonesia (E. contortus), were morphologically characterized. Furthermore, we observed substantial nucleotide differences between their 18S ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA), revealing maximum identity (97.27%) over the 1797-bp length. Similarly, B. obsignata in the small intestine of Japanese green pheasants in Japan, a chicken, geese, domestic pigeons, and a turkey in Indonesia, and C. anatis in the ceca of chickens in Indonesia were morphologically and molecular-genetically compared with previously reported isolates of these species in Japan. Aonchotheca bursata collected from the small intestine of the Japanese green pheasant was also molecular-genetically characterized for the first time; however, sequencing of the 18S rDNA of C. phasianina from the cecum of the same bird was unsuccessful. Capillaria worms in the ceca of a domestic duck and geese in Indonesia were identified as C. spinulosa, which had only previously been recorded in wild birds of the Anseriformes in the Palaearctic region. Morphologically, this species was closest to Capillaria pudendotecta recorded from the ceca of wild and captive swans, except for the lack of vaginal appendages in female worms and shorter esophagi relative to the body length in both male and female worms. Phylogenetically, these two species were closely related, although substantial nucleotide changes were noted. The 18S rDNA nucleotide sequences of the species isolated here were consistent with the recent taxonomic system established for Capillariidae based primarily on the morphology of male caudal ends.

The DNA sequence of a chicken leptin gene that shares 95% nucleotide similarity with the mouse leptin sequence has been recently reported (Taouis et al., 1998, Gene 208, 239-242). Experiments have been performed independently in two laboratories to try to confirm this finding. Fourteen PCR primers based on the mouse leptin sequence were designed to amplify the avian leptin gene. Four of the primers were identical to the mouse and published chicken leptin sequences. PCR amplification was carried out on genomic DNA and reverse-transcribed mRNA from the fat, liver, and pancreas of several chicken strains and from the domestic turkey, goose, and Japanese quail. No PCR products sharing close similarity to the mouse leptin sequence were generated from any avian templates. Amplification of mouse leptin sequence was consistently obtained when control mouse templates were used. Northern hybridization using a mouse leptin probe failed to produce a signal with poly(A)+ RNA from chicken fat and liver and from the fat and liver of force-fed geese but a strong signal was obtained from control mouse fat total RNA. Southern hybridization under low stringency washing conditions revealed hybridization of a mouse leptin probe to chicken genomic DNA. Under higher stringency washing conditions, the chicken signal disappeared, while those from control mouse and sheep genomic DNA remained. This suggests that the putative chicken leptin sequence shares less than the 83% nucleotide sequence identity between the mouse and sheep genes. It is concluded that a chicken leptin gene sequence with close sequence similarity to mouse leptin is not present in the chicken genome. Furthermore, mRNA sharing high sequence identity with mouse leptin is not present in the fat or liver of the domestic chicken, turkey, goose, or Japanese quail.

Previous studies have shown that lipid metabolism in granulosa cells (GCs) plays a vital role during mammalian ovarian follicular development. However, little research has been done on lipid metabolism in avian follicular GCs. The goal of the present study was to investigate the dynamic characteristics of lipid metabolism in GCs from geese pre-hierarchical (6-10 mm) and hierarchical (F4-F2 and F1) follicles during a 6-day period of in vitro culture. Oil red O staining showed that with the increasing incubation time, the amount of lipids accumulated in three cohorts of GCs increased gradually, reached the maxima after 96 h of culture, and then decreased. Moreover, the lipid content varied among these three cohorts, with the highest in F1 GCs. The qPCR results showed genes related to lipid synthesis and oxidation were highest expressed in pre-hierarchical GCs, while those related to lipid transport and deposition were highest expressed in hierarchical GCs. These results suggested that the amount of intracellular lipids in GCs increases with both the follicular diameter and culture time, which is accompanied by significant changes in expression of genes related to lipid metabolism. Therefore, it is postulated that the lipid accumulation capacity of geese GCs depends on the stage of follicle development and is finely regulated by the differential expression of genes related to lipid metabolism.

Migratory behavior of waterfowl populations in North America has traditionally been broadly characterized by four north-south flyways, and these flyways have been central to the management of waterfowl populations for more than 80 yr. However, previous flyway characterizations are not easily updated with current bird movement data and fail to provide assessments of the importance of specific geographical regions to the identification of flyways. Here, we developed a network model of migratory movement for four waterfowl species, Mallard (Anas platyrhnchos), Northern Pintail (A. acuta), American Green-winged Teal (A. carolinensis), and Canada Goose (Branta canadensis), in North America, using bird band and recovery data. We then identified migratory flyways using a community detection algorithm and characterized the importance of smaller geographic regions in identifying flyways using a novel metric, the consolidation factor. We identified four main flyways for Mallards, Northern Pintails, and American Green-winged Teal, with the flyway identification in Canada Geese exhibiting higher complexity. For Mallards, flyways were relatively consistent through time. However, consolidation factors revealed that for Mallards and Green-winged Teal, the presumptive Mississippi flyway was potentially a zone of high mixing between other flyways. Our results demonstrate that the network approach provides a robust method for flyway identification that is widely applicable given the relatively minimal data requirements and is easily updated with future movement data to reflect changes in flyway definitions and management goals.

Endogenous retroviruses are regarded as ideal genetic markers for evolutionary analyses. Birds were some of the initial vertebrates found to contain endogenous retroviruses. However, few studies have investigated the presence and distribution of endogenous retroviruses in goose. In this study, we detected the avian sarcoma and leukosis virus gag gene in the genomic DNA of 8 Chinese native breeds using polymerase chain reaction method. The results indicated that a 1.2-kb avian sarcoma and leukosis virus gag sequence was integrated into all 8 goose breeds. The mean genetic pairwise distance was 0.918% among the investigated geese. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the presence of the endogenous retroviruses in the domestic goose genome. The genetic structure should be further examined in the domestic goose.

The patterns and mechanisms by which biological diversity is associated with parasite infection risk are important to study because of their potential implications for wildlife population's conservation and management. Almost all research in this area has focused on host species diversity and has neglected parasite diversity, despite evidence that parasites are important drivers of community structure and ecosystem processes. Here, we assessed whether presence or abundance of each of nine helminth species parasitizing lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens) was associated with indices of parasite diversity (i.e. species richness and Shannon's Diversity Index). We found repeated instances of focal parasite presence and abundance having significant positive co-variation with diversity measures of other parasites. These results occurred both within individual samples and for combinations of all samples. Whereas host condition and parasite facilitation could be drivers of the patterns we observed, other host- or parasite-level effects, such as age or sex class of host or taxon of parasite, were discounted as explanatory variables. Our findings of recurring and positive associations between focal parasite abundance and diversity underscore the importance of moving beyond pairwise species interactions and contexts, and of including the oft-neglected parasite species diversity in infection-diversity studies.

Increasing goose population sizes gives rise to conflicts with human socioeconomic interests and in some circumstances conservation interests. Grazing by high abundances of geese in grasslands is postulated to lead to a very short and homogeneous sward height negatively affecting cover for breeding meadow birds and impacting survival of nests and chicks. We studied the effects of spring grazing barnacle geese Branta leucopsis and brent geese Branta bernicla on occupancy of extensively farmed freshwater grasslands by nesting and brood-rearing waders on the island Mandø in the Danish Wadden Sea. We hypothesized that goose grazing would lead to a shorter grass sward, negatively affecting the field occupancy by territorial/nesting and chick-rearing waders, particularly species preferring taller vegetation. Goose grazing led to a short grass sward (<5 cm height) over most of the island. To achieve a variation in sward height, we kept geese off certain fields using laser light. We analyzed effects of field size, sward height, mosaic structure of the vegetation, proximity to shrub as cover for potential predators, and elevation above ground water level as a measure of wetness on field occupancy by nesting and chick-rearing waders. The analysis indicated that the most important factor explaining field occupancy by nesting redshank Tringa totanus, black-tailed godwit Limosa limosa, oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus and lapwing Vanellus vanellus as well as by chick-rearing black-tailed godwit and lapwing was short vegetation height. Distance to shrub cover and elevation were less important. Hence, despite very intensive goose grazing, we could not detect any negative effect on the field occupancy by nesting nor chick-rearing waders, including redshank and black-tailed godwit, which are known to favor longer vegetation to conceal their nests and hide their chicks. Possible negative effects may be buffered by mosaic structures in fields and proximity to taller vegetation along fences and ditches.

Economic constraint of diseases arising from Salmonella Typhimurium causes the study of this zoonotic organism more important. Most studies on identification and characterization of S. Typhimurium are conducted at DNA level. Flagellin genes (fliC and fljB genes encoding phase-1 and phase-2 flagella, respectively) are useful as a model system for studying genetic differentiation. The objectives of the present study were to identify the polymorphism of fljB among avians in different regions by the PCR-RFLP method.

This study aims to assess the sustainability of an agroforestry system: i.e. a system obtained by the union of two productions to get at least two by-products from the same productive space. In particular, this case study presents the integration of a goose raising system with an organic grape production, from an environmental point of view. This integration is mainly designed to have two simultaneous co-products (grape and goose meat) with: i) a less intensive use of machineries for weeding and ii) avoiding use of chemical fertilizers and weeding. The sustainability is assessed by means of emergy evaluation. Emergy is a thermodynamic based tool able to estimates the environmental cost of products and services in terms of the solar energy (directly and indirectly) required for its production. As Emergy is not a state function, its final value depends on the way the product is made. The set theory applied to the emergy evaluation enables the comparison between the integrated system and the originating isolated systems in a proper way. Results confirm that the integrated system enables a saving, in emergy terms, amounting to 33% compared to the two originating isolated production systems. Emergy evaluation is able to keep track of the lower amount of resources required from outside the agroforestry system due to the optimization of resources internally available.

From December 2009 to May 2010 goose and duck (Anatidae) community censuses in winter and shorebird (Charadriiforms) community censuses in spring were conducted across three types artificial wetlands (urban lake wetland, restorative wetland, abandoned wetland) along the coast of Nanhui, Shanghai. Correlation analyses were undertaken between community indices and habitat factors. The results showed there were significant differences in the density of geese and ducks among the wetlands, but no difference in the number of species. The density of geese and ducks in the restorative wetland was 3.77 times that of abandoned wetland and 6.03 times that of urban lake wetlands. The number of species and density of shorebirds in restorative wetlands was 2.88 and 5.70 times that of abandoned wetlands. We found significant differences in the number and density of shorebird species between restorative and abandoned wetlands. The number of species density of geese and ducks and the Shannon-Wiener (H') index were positively correlated with water area. The number of species and H' were negatively correlated with vegetation area. The number of species, species density and H' and evenness were negatively correlated with vegetation coverage. H' was positively correlated with mean water level. The results showed that the number and density of shorebird species were positively correlated with bare muddy areas. Aquaculture ponds and paddy fields in reclaimed area is efficient sufficient compensation mechanism to maintain more water areas for waterbirds and to control vegetation expansion and maintain shorebird habitat after coastal reclamation.

In 2008, avian bornaviruses (ABV) were identified as the cause of proventricular dilatation disease (PDD). PDD is a significant condition of captive parrots first identified in the late 1970s. ABV infection has subsequently been shown to be widespread in wild waterfowl across the United States and Canada where the virus infects 10-20% of some populations of ducks, geese and swans. In most cases birds appear to be healthy and unaffected by the presence of the virus; however, infection can also result in severe non-suppurative encephalitis and lesions similar to those seen in parrots with PDD. ABVs are genetically diverse with seven identified genotypes in parrots and one in canaries. A unique goose genotype (ABV-CG) predominates in waterfowl in Canada and the northern United States. ABV appears to be endemic in North American waterfowl, in comparison to what appears to be an emerging disease in parrots. It is not known whether ABV can spread between waterfowl and parrots. The discovery of ABV infection in North American waterfowl suggests that European waterfowl should be evaluated for the presence of ABV, and also as a possible reservoir species for Borna disease virus (BDV), a related neurotropic virus affecting horses and sheep in central Europe. Although investigations have suggested that BDV is likely derived from a wildlife reservoir, for which the shrew and water vole are currently prime candidates, we suggest that the existence of other mammalian and avian reservoirs should not be discounted.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N6 viruses have been circulating in poultry in Asia since 2013 and producing serious diseases in chickens. Here, we analyzed the genetic properties of 10 H5N6 subtypes AIVs from geese in 2015-2016 in Guangdong province. Phylogenic analysis showed that all HA genes of the 10 viruses belonged to clade 2.3.4.4, and their genes including HA, PA, PB1, M, NP, and NS all derived from Mix-like 1 (CH, VN, LS). Their PB2 genes come from Mix-like 2 (CH, VN, JP). The NA genes were classified into a Eurasian lineage. Therefore, the 10 viruses likely originate from the same ancestor and were all recombinant viruses between different genotypes. We selected A/Goose/Guangdong/GS144/2015(H5N6) (GS144) and A/Goose/Guangdong/GS148/2016(H5N6) (GS148) viruses to inoculate 5-week-old chickens intranasally with 104 EID50/0.1 mL dose intranasally to assess their pathogenicity and transmissibility. Inoculated chickens showed that the GS144 virus caused systematic infection with a lethality of 100%, but the lethality of GS148 virus was 0%. The two viruses were efficiently transmitted to contact chickens. The lethality of GS144 and GS148 virus in contact with chickens was 87.5% and 0%, respectively, which suggests that the transmissibility of GS144 virus was stronger than GS148 virus in chickens. Thus, different H5N6 viruses from the same waterfowl can show different pathogenicity and transmissibility in chickens. Continued surveillance and characteristic analysis of the H5N6 viruses will help us to keep abreast of evolution and variation in avian influenza viruses in the future.

The digestive tracts of 771 lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens) collected from January to May 1983 from 12 locations (27 samples) were examined for helminth parasites to determine whether parasite species present in wintering geese or in spring migrants occurred independently of each other. Nine helminth species were identified. Seven had mean prevalences >5% and were the focus of this study. Six of those species were waterfowl generalists, one was a goose specialist. Our primary objective was to assess the potential contribution of factors, other than species interactions, in determining patterns of co-occurrence between helminth species. There were few negative relationships between helminth species, regardless of whether presence-absence or abundance data were used. However, some species pairs showed recurrent and significant co-occurrences. There were similar and significant effects of timing of sampling, host gender, and host age, on prevalence and mean abundance of particular species. Co-occurrences were found for those species that showed seasonal declines in prevalence, for those expected to have high colonizing ability based on host age profiles (using abundance data), and for abundant species that may have shared vectors or environmental conditions favorable for transmission. Thus, similarities between parasites in their abundance, transmission biology, and phenology seem sufficient to explain species co-occurrences without invoking other processes such as species interactions.

Broodiness causes reduced reproductive ability in poultry, but its regulatory mechanism remains poorly understood. ROS (reactive oxygen species) and autophagy are important for follicular development, and the interaction between the two may play a role in regulating broodiness. We examined goose follicles for ROS and oxidation scavenger activities during the egg-laying and broody stages. The follicular granulosa cells were exposed to media containing H2O2, and the interactions between ROS and autophagy in follicular granulosa cells in vitro were analyzed using a Western blot method. We found that the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were enhanced and the amount of malondialdehyde (MDA) decreased in broody goose follicles. H2O2 inhibited the cell viability and induced autophagy. Furthermore, it was also found that H2O2 regulated autophagy by reducing mTOR and increasing p53; however, H2O2 had no impact on Beclin1 or ATG12. It was also shown that the enhanced autophagy lessened ROS-induced damages. We conclude that ROS and autophagy both played important roles in regulating follicular development to control broodiness in geese, and ROS activated autophagy in follicular granulosa cells via the mTOR pathway.

This study investigated the effects of dietary Enteromorpha powder supplementation on the productive performance, egg quality, and antioxidant performance of Zi geese during the late laying period. Three hundred twelve Zi geese (1 yr old) were randomly allocated into 2 cohorts to form a control group and an experimental group (with each cohort including 6 replicates and 21 female geese and 5 male geese in each replicate). The control group was fed a basal diet, and the experimental group was fed a diet containing 3% Enteromorpha powder. The data showed that Enteromorpha powder supplementation significantly improved egg production, laying rate, average daily egg weight (P < 0.01), and egg yolk color (P < 0.05). Supplementation decreased the ADFI and feed conversion rate (P < 0.01). Compared with the control group, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity was significantly higher in serum and ovary tissue (P < 0.05), but GSH-Px activity was lower in liver tissue (P < 0.01). Malondialdehyde was reduced in liver and ovary tissue (P < 0.05) in the Enteromorpha powder supplementation group. Meanwhile, the expression of the CAT gene was significantly upregulated in the liver (P < 0.01) in the Enteromorpha group. These results indicate that dietary Enteromorpha powder supplementation improved productive performance and reduced the level of lipid peroxidation in Zi geese during the late laying period.

The rep-PCR DNA fingerprint technique, which uses repetitive intergenic DNA sequences, was investigated as a way to differentiate between human and animal sources of fecal pollution. BOX and REP primers were used to generate DNA fingerprints from Escherichia coli strains isolated from human and animal sources (geese, ducks, cows, pigs, chickens, and sheep). Our initial studies revealed that the DNA fingerprints obtained with the BOX primer were more effective for grouping E. coli strains than the DNA fingerprints obtained with REP primers. The BOX primer DNA fingerprints of 154 E. coli isolates were analyzed by using the Jaccard band-matching algorithm. Jackknife analysis of the resulting similarity coefficients revealed that 100% of the chicken and cow isolates and between 78 and 90% of the human, goose, duck, pig, and sheep isolates were assigned to the correct source groups. A dendrogram constructed by using Jaccard similarity coefficients almost completely separated the human isolates from the nonhuman isolates. Multivariate analysis of variance, a form of discriminant analysis, successfully differentiated the isolates and placed them in the appropriate source groups. Taken together, our results indicate that rep-PCR performed with the BOX A1R primer may be a useful and effective tool for rapidly determining sources of fecal pollution.

Since 2005 there have been five incursions into Great Britain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses of subtype H5N1 related to the ongoing global epizootic. The first incursion occurred in October 2005 in birds held in quarantine after importation from Taiwan. Two incursions related to wild birds: one involved a single dead whooper swan found in March 2006 in the sea off the east coast of Scotland, and the other involved 10 mute swans and a Canada goose found dead over the period extending from late December 2007 to late February 2008 on or close to a swannery on the south coast of England. The other two outbreaks occurred in commercial poultry in January 2007 and November 2007, both in the county of Suffolk. The first of these poultry outbreaks occurred on a large turkey farm, and there was no further spread. The second outbreak occurred on a free-range farm rearing turkeys, ducks, and geese and spread to birds on a second turkey farm that was culled as a dangerous contact. Viruses isolated from these five outbreaks were confirmed to be Asian H5N1 HPAI viruses; the quarantine outbreak was attributed to a clade 2.3 virus and the other four to clade 2.2 viruses. This article describes the outbreaks, their control, and the possible origins of the responsible viruses.

Avian bornaviruses (ABV), identified in 2008, infect captive parrots and macaws worldwide. The natural reservoirs of these viruses are unknown. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was used to screen oropharyngeal/cloacal swab and brain samples from wild Canada geese (Branta canadensis) for ABV. Approximately 2.9% of swab samples were positive for bornavirus sequences. Fifty-two percent of brain samples from 2 urban flocks also tested positive, and brain isolates were cultured in duck embryo fibroblasts. Phylogenetic analyses placed goose isolates in an independent cluster, and more notably, important regulatory sequences present in Borna disease virus but lacking in psittacine ABVs were present in goose isolates.

Although studies on the evolution and function of female ornaments have become more numerous in the last years, the majority of these studies were carried out in cases where female ornaments were a smaller and duller version of the ornaments found in males. There are substantially fewer studies on species with female-specific ornaments. However, no study so far investigated the potential of female-specific colouration as a quality signal in birds with conventional sex roles. We studied female-specific ornamentation in a strongly sexually dichromatic species, the upland goose Chloephaga picta leucoptera, in two consecutive years. Male upland geese have white head and breast feathers and black legs, whereas females have reddish-brown head and breast feathers and conspicuous yellow-orange legs. We found that female-specific colouration in upland geese can reliably indicate different aspects of female phenotypic quality. Females with more orange coloured legs and more red-like head colours had higher clutch and egg volumes than females with a paler leg and head colouration, and a more reddish plumage colouration was related to a higher body condition. These relationships provide the theoretic possibility for males to assess female phenotypic quality on the basis of colouration. Furthermore, the females with a more orange-like tarsus colouration had higher plasma carotenoid levels. Both tarsus colouration and carotenoid concentrations of individual females were highly correlated across years, indicating that tarsus colour is a stable signal. Despite this correlation, small individual differences in plasma carotenoid concentrations between the two study years were related to differences in tarsus colouration. We thus show for the first time in a wild bird and under natural conditions that carotenoid-based integument colouration remains consistent between individuals in consecutive years and is also a dynamic trait reflecting individual changes in carotenoid levels. In this species, where pairs form life-long bonds, the honesty of the carotenoid-based integument colouration suggests that it may be a sexually selected female ornament that has evolved through male mate choice.

We evaluated the use of DGGE fingerprinting to differentiate communities of Escherichia coli from animal and geographic sources. An initial screening of 15 gene candidates revealed the ability of three target genes (mdh, phoE and uidA-4) to effectively differentiate E. coli communities originating in horses, pigs, geese and goats. Cluster and jackknife analyses performed on the communities from a more extensive number of hosts (n=150) including humans (via raw sewage), horses, pigs, geese and cows revealed that the internal accuracy of classification of E. coli community fingerprints to their origin was similar for each of the three genes (85-86%). Each of the three genes were tested for their ability to associate E. coli source- and sink communities in two settings featuring contaminated water; (i) a stream receiving municipal wastewater effluent and (ii) a pond inhabited by geese. For each gene, DGGE fingerprints effectively matched effluent- and downstream E. coli communities (98-100% similarity) and excluded upstream communities, while communities from goose fecal material were 77-79% similar to communities in pond water, indicating fecal inputs from geese. Furthermore, each gene discriminated against E. coli communities from hosts non-indigenous to either setting. DGGE analysis of E. coli communities appears to be a promising tool to augment existing efforts aiming to address the dynamics of bacteria pollution in complex, natural environments.

This study assessed the influence of genetic type (Embden-Anser anser, EE; Toulouse-Anser anser, TT and F1 cross, ET) for meat characteristics (carcass, meat quality and fatty acid (FA) profiles), of domestic geese "Anser anser domesticus" raised in dehesa as an alternative, organic feeding system. Carcass and breast muscle weight (p<0.01) were greater for the ET group at the same live weight. None of the groups showed differences in the production of fatty liver with this type of feeding. Higher values were found for maximum Warner-Bratzler shear force (between 7.62 and 8.87 kg/cm(2)), which implies the improvement of this parameter. High levels of oleic FAs were obtained, especially for the TT group. The polyunsaturated/saturated FA ratio was highest for the ET group (p<0.001), reflecting the optimum nutritional values as a component of a healthy consumer diet.

The application of artificial loads to mammals and birds has been used to provide insight into the mechanics and energetic cost of terrestrial locomotion. However, only two species of bird have previously been used in loading experiments, the cursorial guinea fowl (Numida meleagris) and the locomotor-generalist barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis). Here, using respirometry and treadmill locomotion, we investigate the energetic cost of carrying trunk loads in a diving bird, the tufted duck (Aythya fuligula). Attachment of back loads equivalent to 10% and 20% of body mass increased the metabolic rate during locomotion (7.94% and 15.92%, respectively) while sternal loads of 5% and 10% had a greater proportional effect than the back loads (metabolic rate increased by 7.19% and 13.99%, respectively). No effect on locomotor kinematics was detected during any load carrying experiments. These results concur with previous reports of load carrying economy in birds, in that there is a less than proportional relationship between increasing load and metabolic rate (found previously in guinea fowl), while application of sternal loads causes an approximate doubling of metabolic rate compared to back loads (reported in an earlier study of barnacle geese). The increase in cost when carrying sternal loads may result from having to move this extra mass dorso-ventrally during respiration. Disparity in load carrying economy between species may arise from anatomical and physiological adaptations to different forms of locomotion, such as the varying uncinate process morphology and hindlimb tendon development in goose, guinea fowl and duck.

Since 2014, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N6 viruses have circulated in waterfowls and caused human infections in China, posing significant threats to the poultry industry and the public health. However, the genetics, pathogenicity and innate immune response of H5N6 HPAIVs in geese remain largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed the genetic characteristic of the two H5N6 viruses (GS38 and DK09) isolated from apparently healthy domestic goose and duck in live poultry markets (LPMs) of Southern China in 2016. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the HA genes of the two H5N6 viruses belonged to clade 2.3.4.4 and were clustered into the MIX-like group. The MIX-like group viruses have circulated in regions such as China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. The NA genes of the two H5N6 viruses were classified into the Eurasian sublineage. The internal genes including PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, and NS of the two H5N6 viruses derived from the MIX-like. Therefore, our results suggested that the two H5N6 viruses were reassortants of the H5N1 and H6N6 viruses and likely derived from the same ancestor. Additionally, we evaluated the pathogenicity and transmission of the two H5N6 viruses in domestic geese. Results showed that both the two viruses caused serious clinical symptoms in all inoculated geese and led to high mortality in these birds. Both the two viruses were transmitted efficiently to contact geese and caused lethal infection in these birds. Furthermore, we found that mRNA of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), interferons (IFNs), and stimulated genes (ISGs) exhibited different levels of activation in the lungs and spleens of the two H5N6 viruses-inoculated geese though did not protect these birds from H5N6 HPAIVs infection. Our results suggested that the clade 2.3.4.4 waterfowl-origin H5N6 HPAIVs isolated from LPMs of Southern China could cause high mortality in geese and innate immune-related genes were involved in the geese innate immune response to H5N6 HPAIVs infection. Therefore, we should pay more attention to the evolution, pathogenic variations of these viruses and enhance virological surveillance of clade 2.3.4.4 H5N6 HPAIVs in waterfowls in China.

Calpain 3 (CAPN3), also known as p94, is associated with multiple production traits in domestic animals. However, the molecular characteristics of the CAPN3 gene and its expression profile in goose tissues have not been reported. In this study, CAPN3 cDNA of the Sichuan white goose was cloned, sequenced, and characterized. The CAPN3 full-length cDNA sequence consists of a 2,316-bp coding sequence (CDS) that encodes 771 amino acids with a molecular mass of 89,019 kDa. The protein was predicted to have no signal peptide, but several N-glycosylation, O-glycosylation, and phosphorylation sites. The secondary structure of CAPN3 was predicted to be 38.65% α-helical. Sequence alignment showed that CAPN3 of Sichuan white goose shared more than 90% amino acid sequence similarity with those of Japanese quail, turkey, helmeted guineafowl, duck, pigeon, and chicken. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that goose CAPN3 has a close genetic relationship and small evolutionary distance with those of the birds. qRT-PCR analysis showed that in 15-day-old animals, the expression level of CAPN3 was significantly higher in breast muscle than in thigh tissues. These results serve as a foundation for further investigations of the function of the goose CAPN3 gene.

Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains of phage types DT104 and U302 are often resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and tetracycline (the ACSSuT resistance type) and are major zoonotic pathogens. Increased consumption of goose meat may enhance the risk of transferring S. enterica serovar Typhimurium and other enteric pathogens from geese to human due to the consumption of meats from infected geese or improper preparation of meats. Therefore, we characterized S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains isolated from four goose farms (farms A, B, C, and D) and one hatchery farm (farm E) to determine the epidemic and genetic differences among them. Antibiotic susceptibility tests and multiplex PCR confirmed that 77.6% (52/67) of strains were ACSSuT strains isolated from farms A, C, and E. Antibiotic-susceptible strains were isolated mostly from farm B, and no strain was observed in farm D. All ACSSuT strains harbored a 94.7-kb virulence plasmid and contained one 1.1-kb conserved segment identical to that of Salmonella genomic island 1. Four genotypes were determined among these S. enterica serovar Typhimurium isolates by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis of XbaI-digested DNA fragments. Most isolates (85.29%; 29/34) of major genotype Ib were ACSSuT strains isolated mainly from goslings of farm C and egg membranes of farm E, a hatchery farm, suggesting that S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains in isolates from goslings might originate from its hatchery, from the egg membranes to the gosling fluff after hatching. Multiple phage types, types 8, 12, U283, DT104, and U302, were identified. In conclusion, geese were a reservoir of diverse multidrug-resistant (type ACSSuT) S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains, and each farm was colonized with genetically closely related S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains.

To determine whether geese are susceptible to infection by avian leukosis virus (ALV), 702 serum samples from domestic and foreign goose breeds were screened for p27 antigen as well as being inoculated into DF-1 cell cultures to isolate ALV. Although 5.7% of samples were positive for p27 antigen, reactivity appeared to be non-specific because no ALV was detected in the corresponding DF-1 cultures. To further determine whether geese are susceptible to ALV-J isolated from chickens, ALV-J strain JS09GY7 was artificially inoculated into 10-day-old goose embryos, with one-day-old hatched goslings then screened for p27 antigen and the presence of ALV. In all cases, the results of both tests were negative. Liver tissues from the 1-day-old goslings were screened using a polymerase chain reaction-based assay, which failed to amplify ALV-J gene fragments from any of the samples. Further, no histopathological damage was observed in the liver tissues. ALV-J was further inoculated intraperitoneally into one-day-old goslings, with cloacal swabs samples and plasma samples then collected every 5 days for 30 days. All samples were again negative for the presence of p27 antigen and ALV, and liver tissues from the challenged geese showed no histopathological damage and were negative for the presence of ALV-J gene fragments. Furthermore, p27 antigen detection, PCR-based screening, and indirect immunofluorescence assays were all negative following the infection of goose embryo fibroblasts with ALV-J. Together, these results confirm that virulent chicken-derived ALV-J strains cannot infect geese, and that p27 antigen detection in goose serum is susceptible to non-specific interference.

An analysis of radiological images of the spongious substance of the tibiotarsal bones in domestic goose (120 individuals) was performed for the first time. Based on radiographs obtained from radiological examinations conducted in the region of interest (80 x 90 mm2) of the proximal metaphysis, an analysis of the spongious substance of the tibia was performed with the Trabecula programme in order to construct a map of trabeculae and identify their number, volume and density. The results were evaluated statistically using two-way ANOVA. Changes in the number, volume and density of radiological trabeculae of the tibiotarsal bone (TB) in geese from 4 to 16 weeks old were observed. The lowest number (6.34 per mm2), volume (1.50% mm) and density (33.73%) of radiological trabeculae in the proximal metaphysis of TB was reported in male geese at the age of 6 weeks. Similar tendencies were observed in females as well. It should be noted that the volume and density of radiological trabeculae of the tibiotarsal bone achieved a maximum value in males 12 weeks of age, whereas in females at 8 weeks of age. An inverse relationship between body weight and the number of trabeculae in domestic geese (r = - 0.28; P < or = 0.05) was found. We also found a positive relationship between body weight and the volume of radiological trabeculae in domestic geese (r = 0.43; P < or = 0.05). During posthatching development, from the 4th week to slaughter maturity, a decrease in relative bone mass was observed. Negative changes in the trabecular structure combined with high weight gain could lead to bone deformities and locomotor problems in the studied geese.

Two major outbreaks of parvovirus infection occurred in domestic waterfowls in Taiwan in the last two decades; the first was in 1982 and the second in 1989/1990. Parvoviruses isolated in the two outbreaks were sequenced between nucleotides 142 and 680 of the VP3 gene. Sequence comparisons reveal that these viruses could be divided into two groups respectively related to goose parvovirus (GPV) and Muscovy duck parvovirus (MDPV). Nucleotide differences between ''GPV'' and ''MDPV'' groups range from 16.2% to 19.4%. In comparison, the differences within the ''GPV'' group are only 0-6.5%, while those within the ''MDPV'' group are only 0.2-1.7%. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that parvoviruses isolated in the 1982 outbreak in Taiwan are all GPV-related, whereas those isolated in the 1989/1990 outbreak are all MDPV-related. GPV-related isolates from Taiwan were separated into two groups, Thai group and European group. In comparison, all MDPV-related isolates from Taiwan are clustered in a single group that is closely related to a French MDPV isolate. The MDPV-related infection in Taiwan occurred at almost the same time in 1989 as the MDPV outbreak in France. The close phylogenetic relationship between the ''MDPV'' Taiwanese isolates and the French MDPV isolate exhibited on the VP3 fragment investigated suggests that they should be compared more deeply, to look for a possible common origin. The MDPV-related 1985 isolate might be a candidate.

Even though growth rate is an important fitness component, it is still controversial to what extent parent birds adjust the timing of offspring hatch to natural variations in food supply to maximize offspring growth. We studied the role of food availability in explaining inter- and intra-seasonal variation of growth rate in goslings of greater snow geese over 5 years. The peak of hatching generally coincided with the peak of food availability. However, early-hatched goslings usually grew faster than birds hatched at the peak, which in␣turn grew faster than late-hatched goslings, although this phenomenon was not observed in all years. There was considerable variation in growth rate among the five years, the smallest goslings produced in the best year (1991) being larger than the largest goslings of the poorest year (1994). We developed three indices of food availability, based on the cumulative availability of plant biomass and nitrogen content during the growth period, and showed that the cumulative exposure to nitrogen biomass explained up to 43% of variation (intra- and inter-annual) in body size just before fledging. In years with good feeding conditions, early-hatched goslings had access to more nitrogen during their growing period than those hatching on or after the peak and they grew faster. In years of lower food availability, early-hatched goslings had no detectable advantage over peak- or late-hatched birds for access to protein-rich food and no seasonal decline in growth rate was observed. These results confirm the critical role of food supply in the seasonal variation of growth rate in Arctic-nesting geese.

With the current absence of scientific information on the nutritive aspects it is essential to investigate the fatty acid, mineral, and amino acid composition of Egyptian geese as well as the factors of influence. The forage vs. grain based diets of Egyptian geese during certain periods of the yr leads to variation in the content of the key fatty acids such as oleic acid, linoleic acid, and α-linolenic acid. The differences in these fatty acids results in variation between the n-6/n-3 ratios of the seasons; the portions from winter (July) are within the recommendations (ratio <5) and those from summer (November) not. This study indicates that Egyptian goose meat does not only vary in nutritional composition but season may also have a substantial effect on the flavor profile and ultimate uniformity of the meat. The season and portion effects were, however, interlinked but the general tendency shows that the portions, especially the breast and thigh do differ concerning the major fatty acids. No substantial differences were found in the mineral composition of the breast portion on account of season and gender; however there were some variation in certain amino acids such as lysine and arginine due to season/diet. This research provides essential information that should be considered not only regarding the everyday consumption of Egyptian goose meat but the potential utilization and ultimate consistency of this meat product.

1. Many ecosystems are characterized by pulses of dramatically higher than normal levels of foods (pulsed resources) to which animals often respond by caching foods for future use. However, the extent to which animals use cached foods and how this varies in relation to fluctuations in other foods is poorly understood in most animals. 2. Arctic foxes Alopex lagopus (L.) cache thousands of eggs annually at large goose colonies where eggs are often superabundant during the nesting period by geese. We estimated the contribution of cached eggs to arctic fox diets in spring and autumn, when geese were not present in the study area, by comparing stable isotope ratios (delta(13)C and delta(15)N) of fox tissues with those of their foods using a multisource mixing model in Program IsoSource. 3. The contribution of cached eggs to arctic fox diets was inversely related to collared lemming Dicrostonyx groenlandicus (Traill) abundance; the contribution of cached eggs to overall fox diets increased from < 28% in years when collared lemmings were abundant to 30-74% in years when collared lemmings were scarce. 4. Further, arctic foxes used cached eggs well into the following spring (almost 1 year after eggs were acquired) - a pattern that differs from that of carnivores generally storing foods for only a few days before consumption. 5. This study showed that long-term use of eggs that were cached when geese were superabundant at the colony in summer varied with fluctuations in collared lemming abundance (a key component in arctic fox diets throughout most of their range) and suggests that cached eggs functioned as a buffer when collared lemmings were scarce.

In the present study a monoclonal antibody (mAb 14A3) was tested for its reactivity against serum immunoglobulin Y (IgY) of several waterfowl species, and subsequently for its applicability as anti-species antibody in common immunoassays. Western blot analyses demonstrated its broad cross-reactivity with the serum IgY light chain of different duck species: Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata), Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), white-winged wood duck (Asarcornis scutulatus), common pintail (Dafila acuta). Reactivity was also evident with IgY of two swan species--mute swan (Cygnus olor) and black-necked swan (Sthenelides melanocoryphus)--and two goose species--domestic goose (Anser anser var. domestica) and red-breasted goose (Rufibrenta ruficollis). Applying the mAb for Newcastle disease virus (avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 [APMV-1]) test systems, its functionality within indirect immunoassays was evaluated. Using APMV-1-positive sera of domestic geese and Muscovy ducks, mAb 14A3 facilitated specific staining of APMV-1-infected cells in an immunofluorescence test. In addition, it proved to be functional in an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a western blot assay. Thus, the analysed mAb represents an attractive and versatile reagent that offers the opportunity to develop serological tests for waterfowl, allowing a high sample throughput using the ELISA technique or the fine analysis of humoral immune responses using the western blot.

H9N2 subtype influenza A virus (IAV) has more than 20 genotypes that are able to cross species barriers and expand from birds to mammals and humans. To better understand the impact of different H9N2 genotypes and their characteristics, five H9N2 viruses from different hosts including chickens, geese, pigs, mink, and humans representing the B69 88(Gs/14, Ck/15, and Mi/14), B35 (Sw/08) and G9 genotypes (Hu/04) were infected in chicken and mice. In mice, mammal-origin viruses replicated at higher levels in the lungs compared to avian viruses. The goose-virus replicated at the lowest levels indicating poor adaptation. Increased pro-inflammatory cytokines were positively correlated with viral loads in the lung. In chickens, all viruses were excreted from cloacal and/or oropharyngeal swabs. Interestingly, Mink-origin virus exhibited higher virulence and replication in mice and chickens. Our data indicate that mammal-origin H9N2 viruses are more adapted and virulent in mice than the avian-origin viruses.

Arctic-nesting geese are classified as "capital" breeders (i.e., birds that rely largely on endogenous reserves to meet the high nutrient requirement of clutch formation) as opposed to "income" breeders (those that rely directly on ingested food). However, some evidence has suggested that energy reserves of greater snow geese (Chen caerulescens atlantica) are not sufficient to meet these costs. We tested whether greater snow geese were capital breeders and examined the consequences on their reproductive strategy. We collected 48 females and 47 males from arrival at the breeding colony on Bylot Island (NWT) to the postlaying stage, and determined fat and protein content in somatic and reproductive tissues. Rapid follicular growth was initiated only after arrival on the breeding ground. Somatic fat of females tended to increase during the prelaying and laying stages at the same time that most of the fat was deposited in developing follicles. Decrease in somatic fat in postlaying females was mostly related to its use for meeting metabolic requirements during early incubation. Hence, almost all fat invested in the clutch came from food intake, not endogenous reserves. Somatic protein was maintained during prelaying but decreased during laying, suggesting that some protein reserves were deposited in the eggs. There was no relationship between somatic fat and the number of developing follicles (incubating females excluded) but a relationship was found with somatic protein. Clutch size was not related to body size. In males, somatic fat, which was similar to females at arrival, was almost completely depleted by the postlaying stage. Male somatic protein remained stable. Male somatic reserves were not related to the somatic reserves, clutch size or nutrient investment in reproduction of their mate. We conclude that, in female greater snow geese, little fat reserves (if any) were used for egg formation though some protein reserves were used, whereas males relied heavily on their fat reserves during the same period. This is probably a consequence of the long and costly migration between the last staging area and the breeding grounds.

Adiponectin is an adipokine associated with the regulation of reproductive processes. To determine whether recombinant goose adiponectin contributes to the goose ovarian steroidogenesis, the native and then purified goose recombinant adiponectin protein was produced using recombinant DNA technologies. The effect of recombinant adiponectin on the progesterone (P4) and estradiol (E2) production in Huoyan geese ovarian granulosa cells was examined. Furthermore, the effect of recombinant adiponectin (2.5 μg/mL) on the abundance of StAR (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein), CYP11A1 (cytochrome P450scc, cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme) and CYP19A1 (cytochrome P450 aromatase) mRNA and protein in granulosa cells was evaluated. Results indicate that a 24-h treatment with recombinant adiponectin (2.5 μg/mL) affected P4 and E2 production by geese ovarian granulosa cells by stimulating P4 production (P < 0.01) and weakly inhibiting E2 production (P > 0.05). Furthermore, when the results with treatment were compared to when there was not adiponectin treatment, the abundance of StAR and CYP11A1 mRNA was greater (P < 0.05) while the CYP19A1 mRNA slightly decreased (P > 0.05). In addition, the fluorescence intensity of StAR tended to be greater compared to PBS-treated (P < 0.05) and control groups (P > 0.05) and StAR protein abundance was greater (P < 0.05) compared to the other two groups. The fluorescence intensity and protein abundances of CYP11A1 increased (P < 0.05) while those for CYP19A1 tended to decrease (P > 0.05) after adiponectin treatment. The results indicate recombinant goose adiponectin affects steroidogenesis and/or hormone secretion of geese ovarian granulosa cells. There may, therefore, be important functions of adiponectin in goose reproductive physiology.

Climate change is occurring rapidly at high latitudes, and subsequent changes in parasite communities may have implications for hosts including wildlife and humans. Waterfowl, in particular, harbor numerous parasites and may facilitate parasite movement across broad geographic areas due to migratory movements. However, little is known about helminth community structure of waterfowl at northern latitudes. We investigated the helminth communities of two avian herbivores that breed at high latitudes, Pacific black brant (Branta bernicla nigricans), and greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons), to examine effects of species, geographic area, age, and sex on helminth species richness, aggregation, prevalence, and intensity. We collected 83 and 58 black brant and white-fronted geese, respectively, from Arctic and Subarctic Alaska July-August 2014. We identified 10 known helminth species (Amidostomum anseris, Amidostomum spatulatum, Drepanidotaenia lanceolata, Epomidiostomum crami, Heterakis dispar, Notocotylus attenuatus, Tetrameres striata, Trichostrongylus tenuis, Tschertkovilepis setigera, and Wardoides nyrocae) and 1 previously undescribed trematode. All geese sampled were infected with at least one helminth species. All helminth species identified were present in both age classes and species, providing evidence of transmission at high latitudes and suggesting broad host susceptibility. Also, all but one helminth species were present at both sites, suggesting conditions are suitable for transmission across a large latitudinal/environmental gradient. Our study provides important baseline information on avian parasites that can be used to evaluate the effects of a changing climate on host-parasite distributions.

An understanding of the genetic structure of populations in the wild is essential for long-term conservation and stewardship in the face of environmental change. Knowledge of the present-day distribution of genetic lineages (phylogeography) of a species is especially important for organisms that are exploited or utilize habitats that may be jeopardized by human intervention, including climate change. Here, we describe mitochondrial (mtDNA) and nuclear genetic (microsatellite) diversity among three populations of a migratory bird, the greater white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons), which breeds discontinuously in western and southwestern Alaska and winters in the Pacific Flyway of North America. Significant genetic structure was evident at both marker types. All three populations were differentiated for mtDNA, whereas microsatellite analysis only differentiated geese from the Cook Inlet Basin. In sexual reproducing species, nonrandom mate selection, when occurring in concert with fine-scale resource partitioning, can lead to phenotypic and genetic divergence as we observed in our study. If mate selection does not occur at the time of reproduction, which is not uncommon in long-lived organisms, then mechanisms influencing the true availability of potential mates may be obscured, and the degree of genetic and phenotypic diversity may appear incongruous with presumed patterns of gene flow. Previous investigations revealed population-specific behavioral, temporal, and spatial mechanisms that likely influence the amount of gene flow measured among greater white-fronted goose populations. The degree of observed genetic structuring aligns well with our current understanding of population differences pertaining to seasonal movements, social structure, pairing behavior, and resource partitioning.

All hepadnaviruses known so far have a very limited host range, restricted to their natural hosts and a few closely related species. This is thought to be due mainly to sequence divergence in the large envelope protein and species-specific differences in host components essential for virus propagation. Here we report an infection of cranes with a novel hepadnavirus, designated CHBV, that has an unexpectedly broad host range and is only distantly evolutionarily related to avihepadnaviruses of related hosts. Direct DNA sequencing of amplified CHBV DNA as well a sequencing of cloned viral genomes revealed that CHBV is most closely related to, although distinct from, Ross' goose hepatitis B virus (RGHBV) and slightly less closely related to duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV). Phylogenetically, cranes are very distant from geese and ducks and are most closely related to herons and storks. Naturally occurring hepadnaviruses in the last two species are highly divergent in sequence from RGHBV and DHBV and do not infect ducks or do so only marginally. In contrast, CHBV from crane sera and recombinant CHBV produced from LMH cells infected primary duck hepatocytes almost as efficiently as DHBV did. This is the first report of a rather broad host range of an avihepadnavirus. Our data imply either usage of similar or identical entry pathways and receptors by DHBV and CHBV, unusual host and virus adaptation mechanisms, or divergent evolution of the host genomes and cellular components required for virus propagation.

This trial was conducted to study the effect of full-fat rice bran inclusion in diets on growth performance, carcass and meat quality and fatty acid composition in Sichuan goose. A total of 204 Sichuan white male geese (28-d-old, 984 ± 15 g) were used in the 42-d assay. Full-fat rice bran inclusion in diets was 0%, 6%, 12% and 18%, respectively. On d 70, two geese from each pen were randomly selected and killed for measuring the carcass and meat quality and the meat fatty acid composition. The results showed that full-fat rice bran inclusion had no effect on average daily gain during 28-56 d, but rice bran inclusion at 18% increased average daily gain during 57-70 d. In addition, the full-fat rice bran supplementation decreased the subcutaneous fat yield, and the inclusion of full-fat rice bran in amounts of 12% and 18% decreased the half-eviscerated carcass yield, eviscerated carcass yield and crude fat content in goose meat. Moreover, full-fat rice bran supplementation had no effect on the content of total saturated fatty acid (SFA), but decreased the content of total monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA). The inclusion of full-fat rice bran in amounts of 12-18% increased the content of total polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and total n-6 in goose meat and in the amount of 18% increased n-3 fatty acids content in goose meat. The results indicated that the rice bran inclusion had a positive effect in geese by stimulating growth performance and improving meat quality and fatty acid composition of goose meat.

Samples (blood or tissue fluid) from 594 arctic foxes (Alopex lagopus), 390 Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus), 361 sibling voles (Microtus rossiaemeridionalis), 17 walruses (Odobenus rosmarus), 149 barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis), 58 kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla), and 27 glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus) from Svalbard and nearby waters were assayed for antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii using a direct agglutination test. The proportion of seropositive animals was 43% in arctic foxes, 7% in barnacle geese, and 6% (1 of 17) in walruses. There were no seropositive Svalbard reindeer, sibling voles, glaucous gulls, or kittiwakes. The prevalence in the arctic fox was relatively high compared to previous reports from canid populations. There are no wild felids in Svalbard and domestic cats are prohibited, and the absence of antibodies against T. gondii among the herbivorous Svalbard reindeer and voles indicates that transmission of the parasite by oocysts is not likely to be an important mechanism in the Svalbard ecosystem. Our results suggest that migratory birds, such as the barnacle goose, may be the most important vectors bringing the parasite to Svalbard. In addition to transmission through infected prey and carrion, the age-seroprevalence profile in the fox population suggests that their infection levels are enhanced by vertical transmission.

Lipids are an important nutritional component of the avian egg. A review of the literature was completed to determine the fatty acid compositions in egg yolk from some avian species. Additionally, the nutritional influence of lipid and lipoprotein content on the plasma of male participants during 30-day feeding was discussed. The ostrich eggs had the highest unsaturated fatty acid and the lowest cholesterol content in relation to other avian species. Ostrich had a higher proportion of 18:3n-3 (p < 0.01) compared with other species. Chicken yolk numerically contained much higher levels of 22:6n-3 than those found in turkeys, quails and geese, but the amount of 22:6n-3 in ostrich egg was lower by comparison with other species (p < 0.01). After the storage of eggs at the room temperature, there was a notable loss of vitamin E (vitE) in the yolks of all species and this decrease was marginal (p < 0.01) in ostrich compared with other species. There were significant (p < 0.05) increases in plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level in all male subjects. Plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level decreased (p < 0.05) only in men who were fed chicken or ostrich eggs daily. Consumption of different species' eggs had no influence on the total male plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels. LDL-C:HDL-C ratio increased (p < 0.05) after goose and turkey egg consumption. Consumption of one egg/month by healthy human subjects had no effect on serum total cholesterol and triglyceride. The LDL-C:HDL-C ratio (which is a strong predictor of coronary heart disease risk) increased, although non-significantly, by consuming chicken, quail and ostrich eggs.

1. Habitat heterogeneity and predator behaviour can strongly affect predator-prey interactions but these factors are rarely considered simultaneously, especially when systems encompass multiple predators and prey. 2. In the Arctic, greater snow geese Anser caerulescens atlanticus L. nest in two structurally different habitats: wetlands that form intricate networks of water channels, and mesic tundra where such obstacles are absent. In this heterogeneous environment, goose eggs are exposed to two types of predators: the arctic fox Vulpes lagopus L. and a diversity of avian predators. We hypothesized that, contrary to birds, the hunting ability of foxes would be impaired by the structurally complex wetland habitat, resulting in a lower predation risk for goose eggs. 3. In addition, lemmings, the main prey of foxes, show strong population cycles. We thus further examined how their fluctuations influenced the interaction between habitat heterogeneity and fox predation on goose eggs. 4. An experimental approach with artificial nests suggested that foxes were faster than avian predators to find unattended goose nests in mesic tundra whereas the reverse was true in wetlands. Foxes spent 3.5 times more time between consecutive attacks on real goose nests in wetlands than in mesic tundra. Their attacks on goose nests were also half as successful in wetlands than in mesic tundra whereas no difference was found for avian predators. 5. Nesting success in wetlands (65%) was higher than in mesic tundra (56%) but the difference between habitats increased during lemming crashes (15%) compared to other phases of the cycle (5%). Nests located at the edge of wetland patches were also less successful than central ones, suggesting a gradient in accessibility of goose nests in wetlands for foxes. 6. Our study shows that the structural complexity of wetlands decreases predation risk from foxes but not avian predators in arctic-nesting birds. Our results also demonstrate that cyclic lemming populations indirectly alter the spatial distribution of productive nests due to a complex interaction between habitat structure, prey-switching and foraging success of foxes.

Goose fatty liver is one of the most delicious and popular foods in the world, but there is no reliable genetic marker for the early selection and breeding of geese with good liver-producing potential. In our study, one hundred and twenty-four 78-day-old Landes geese bred in Shunda Landes goose breeding farm, Jiutai, Jilin, China were selected randomly. The fatty livers were sampled each week after overfeeding during a three week period. Polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing were used to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of fatty acid synthase (FAS), which is an important enzyme involved in the synthesis of fat under both physiological and pathological conditions. Least-squares correlation was established between these SNPs and fatty liver weight, abdominal fat weight, and intestinal fat weight of the overfed Landes geese, respectively. The results showed that fatty liver weight of geese with EF and FF genotypes (amplified by primer P1) was significantly higher than that of the EE genotype (p<0.05), and liver weight of CD and DD genotypes (amplified by primer P2) was significantly higher than that of the CC genotype (p<0.05). Different genotype combinations showed different liver weights, and from highest to lowest were ABDD, DDEF, DDFF, DDEE, ABEF, ABFF, AADD, and CDEF. Further analysis of DNA sequencing showed that there were two SNPs within the 5' promoter region the FAS gene. The geese of EF and FF genotypes carried a change of T to C, and the geese of CD and DD genotypes carried a change of A to G. The changes of the bases could potentially influence the binding of some transcription factors to this region as to regulate FAS gene. To our knowledge, this is the first report of SNPs found within the 5' promoter region of the Landes goose FAS gene, and our data will provide an insight for early selection of geese for liver production.

The objective of the current study was to investigate the effects of dietary ω-6/ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) ratios on lipid metabolism in goslings. One hundred and sixty 21-day-old Yangzhou geese of similar weight were randomly divided into 4 groups. They were fed different PUFA-supplemented diets (the 4 diets had ω-6/ω-3 PUFA ratios of 12:1, 9:1, 6:1, or 3:1). The geese were slaughtered and samples of liver and muscle were collected at day 70. The activities and the gene expression of enzymes involved in lipid metabolism were measured. The results show that the activities of acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), malic enzyme (ME), and fatty acid synthase (FAS) were lower (p<0.05), but the activities of hepatic lipase (HL) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) were higher (p<0.05), in the liver and the muscle from the 3:1 and 6:1 groups compared with those in the 9:1 and 12:1 groups. Expression of the genes for FAS (p<0.01), ME (p<0.01) and ACC (p<0.05) were higher in the muscle of groups fed diets with higher ω-6/ω-3 PUFA ratios. Additionally, in situ hybridization tests showed that the expression intensities of the high density lipoprotein (HDL-R) gene in the 12:1 and 9:1 groups were significantly lower (p<0.01) than that of the 3:1 group in the muscle of goslings. In conclusion, diets containing lower ω-6/ω-3 PUFA ratios (3:1 or 6:1) could decrease fat deposition by inhibiting fat synthesis in goslings.

Naturally occurring lymphoreticular tumours were found in an adult goose flock. Diffuse and/or nodular lymphoma-like tumours occurred in the spleen, liver, pancreas, intestines and rarely in other internal organs. Osteopetrosis-like lesions and signs of other diseases such as amidostomosis, enteritis, arthritis and air sacculitis were also observed. The tumourous lesions consisted of proliferations of undifferentiated lymphoblasts and slightly differentiated plasmablasts of the bursal system of lymphocytes. Tumour cell proliferation was usually associated with parenchymal atrophy and occasionally with amyloid depositions along the walls of capillaries of the spleen and the liver. In tissue cultures, chloroform sensitive, typical C-type virus particles of about 100 nm were isolated. The isolate incorporated 3H-uridine, banded at about 1.19 to 1.20 g/cm(3) in sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation and was shown to be antigenically related to the reticuloendotheliosis group of avian retroviruses. In transmission experiments with chickens and geese, one of the four tested reticuloendotheliosis virus-positive cellular field materials caused a highly lethal neoplastic disease similar in cytology to that seen in the natural disease outbreak within four weeks after infection. The other three cellular field materials and the tissue-culture-propagated virus isolates induced either a runting disease syndrome or a similar chronic neoplasia to that found in the naturally diseased geese during an experimental period of 30 weeks. Reticuloendotheliosis virus was reisolated from the experimentally inoculated birds, and antibodies to the T strain of reticuloendotheliosis virus were also demonstrated in sera of surviving chickens. Neither Marek's disease virus nor avian leukosis-sarcoma viruses could be demonstrated in tissue cultures or in chickens of transmission experiments. The reported transmissible lymphoreticular tumours of domestic goose seem to be associated with infection of a new isolate of the reticuloendotheliosis group of viruses designated as Reticuloendotheliosis Virus Hungary-2 (REV-H-2).

The disease syndromes caused by avian influenza viruses are highly variable depending on the host species infected, its susceptibility and response to infection and the virulence of the infecting viral strain. Although avian influenza viruses have a broad host range in general, it is rare for an individual strain or subtype to infect more than one species. The H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) lineages of viruses that descended from A/goose/Guandong/96 (H5N1 HPAIV) are unusual in the diversity of species they have infected worldwide. Although the species affected by H5N1 HPAI in the field and those that have been experimentally studied are diverse, their associated disease syndromes are remarkably similar across species. In some species, multi-organ failure and death are rapid and no signs of the disease are observed. Most prominently in this category are chickens and other avian species of the order Galliformes. In other species, neurologic signs develop resulting in the death of the host. This is what has been reported in domestic cats (Carnivora), geese (Anseriformes), ratites (Struthioniformes), pigeons inoculated with high doses (Columbiformes) and ducks infected with H5N1 HPAIV isolated since 2002 (Anseriformes). In some other species, the disease is more prolonged and although multi-organ failure and death are the eventual outcomes, the signs of disease are more extensive. Predominantly, these species include humans (Primates) and the laboratory models of human disease, the ferret (Carnivora), mouse (Rodentia) and cynamologous macaques (Primates). Finally, some species are more resistant to infection with H5N1 HPAIV and show few or no signs of disease. These species include pigeons in some studies (Columbiformes), ducks inoculated with pre-2002 isolates (Anseriformes), and pigs (Artiodactyla).

Forty-three fowl adenovirus (FAdV) strains were isolated in China from 2007 to 2014 from poultry and ostriches with inclusion body hepatitis (IBH) and hydropericardium syndrome (HPS). Phylogenetic analysis showed that 28/43 strains clustered into Fowl aviadenovirus D (FAdV-D) and 9/43 strains clustered into FAdV-E. FAdV-C included three isolates of ostrich origin, one of goose origin and two of chicken origin. Based on hexon loop 1 gene sequencing analysis, these viruses were genetically related to FAdV-4, FAdV-8a, FAdV-8b and FAdV-11, of which FAdV-11 was dominant. The isolation in 2014 of three FAdV strains belonging to serotype 4 from ostrich flocks is to our knowledge the first finding of FAdV-4 infection and HPS cases in ostriches. Epidemiological analysis showed that FAdV has been circulating in northern and eastern China, where more than 50% of layers and broilers are raised. The hosts of this pathogen included broilers, layers, geese and ostriches. IBH and HPS cases had a sporadic or cluster distribution from 2007 to 2013; however, since 2014 the number of cases has increased sharply. To control FAdV, strict biosecurity protection measures are necessary and a multivalent vaccine may be needed.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of stress (as measured by total heterophil + eosinophil counts [THECs] and plasma corticosterone [PC] levels) on plasma protein electrophoresis (PPE) in two Anseriform species. Ten red-breasted geese ( Branta ruficollis ) and eight Hawaiian geese (Branta sandvicensis) were received into quarantine at Beauval Zoo and housed together with other Anseriformes. Two days later, all were examined as part of routine quarantine procedures, and blood was collected. THECs were performed using a Malassez hemocytometer after a 1 : 200 dilution with an eosinophil dilution liquid containing phloxine B. PPE, as well as total protein and PC assays, was performed on lithium heparin plasma. Twenty days after arrival, all birds were similarly restrained, examined, and sampled. Pododermatitis lesions were identified on four geese that were excluded from statistical analysis. For each goose, THECs and PC values were sorted by value (lower or higher) independently from the day of sampling. A Wilcoxon signed rank test showed no significant differences between lower and higher values of THECs for any of the PPE fractions. Higher values of corticosterone were associated with higher values of prealbumin, but none of the other fractions were significantly different. A Spearman rank correlation coefficient showed that THECs and PC were not correlated; this suggested differences in kinetics between these stress markers. Results did not show significant alterations of electrophoresis patterns associated with stress as measured with THECs and PC. The results also highlight the complexity of precisely assessing acute and chronic stress in avian species.

In August 2010, geese in the Meihekou area of Jilin province in China were found to be infected by a pathogen that caused a disease similar to Newcastle disease. To determine the causative agent of the infections, a virus was isolated from liver tissues of infected geese, followed by a pathogenicity determination. The isolated virus was named NDV/White Goose/China/Jilin(Meihekou)/MHK-1/2010. Specific primers were designed to amplify the whole genome of the MHK-1 virus, followed by sequencing and splicing of the entire genome. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of MHK-1 showed that the isolate was a virulent strain of Newcastle disease virus. The MHK-1 genome is 15,192 nucleotides long, and it belongs to the class II branch of Newcastle disease viruses, as evidenced by the amino acid sequence (112R-R-Q-K-R-F117) of the F protein. The hemagglutinin titer was 1:128 to 1:512. The chicken embryo mean death time, the intracerebral pathogenicity index, and the median lethal dose of chicken embryos of MHK-1 were 43 hr, 1.63, and 10(9)/ml, respectively, which revealed that the newly isolated MHK-1 strain is strongly pathogenic to geese.

1. The study objectives were to determine the direct effects of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) on the proliferation of ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) and the development of follicles in geese (Anser cygnoides) by colorimetry and ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) cell proliferation assays, in which primary GCs were treated with different concentrations of GnRH agonist (alarelin acetate) and an antagonist (cetrorelix acetate). Differently expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by RNA-sequencing and validated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blotting.2. The EdU assays showed that the proliferation of GCs was affected by the GnRH agonist and antagonist in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of treatment on cell proliferation was statistically significant at the concentrations of 10-5 mol/l alarelin and 1 mg/l cetrorelix acetate. A total of 134 DEGs (76 downregulated and 58 upregulated for alarelin treatment) and 226 DEGs (90 downregulated and 136 upregulated for cetrorelix) were identified by RNA-sequencing analysis, respectively. Enrichment analysis indicated that DEGs were enriched in the GO terms of cell-cell signalling and cell junctions. The pathways that regulate the development of follicles were identified, including the biological progress of cAMP accumulation, ovulation cycle and vasculature that are essential to follicular selection.3. The results suggested that GnRH might directly regulate GC proliferation via autocrine or paracrine pathways related to cell junctions. In particular, it was confirmed that the mRNA and protein expression levels of the oestrogen receptor 2 (ESR2) gene, a negative transcription factor involved in follicular maturation and ovulation, were affected by GnRH agonist or antagonist in GCs.4. In conclusion, GnRH might play an important role in follicular development by changing the expression of genes that participate in cAMP accumulation, ovulation cycle and cell junctions in ovarian GCs.

During a study on high mortality cases of goose embryo in Shandong Province, China (2014-2015), we isolated an H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV) strain (A/goose/Shandong/DP01/2014, DP01), which was supposedly the causative agent for goose embryo death. Sequence analysis revealed that DP01 shared 99.9% homology in the HA gene with a classic immune suppression strain SD06. To study the potential vertical transmission ability of the DP01 strain in breeder goose, a total of 105 Taizhou breeder geese, which were 360 days old, were equally divided into five groups (A, B, C, D, and E) for experimental infection. H9N2 AIV (DP01) was used for inoculating through intravenous (group A), intranasal instillation (group B), and throat inoculation (group C) routes, respectively. The geese in group D were inoculated with phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and those in group E were the non-treated group. At 24 h post inoculation, H9N2 viral RNA could be detected at vitelline membrane, embryos, and allantoic fluid of goose embryos from H9N2 inoculated groups. Furthermore, the HA gene of H9N2 virus from vitelline membrane, embryo, allantoic fluid, and gosling shared almost 100% homology with an H9N2 virus isolated from the ovary of breeder goose, which laid these eggs, indicating that H9N2 AIV can be vertically transmitted in goose. The present research study provides evidence that vertical transmission of H9N2 AIV from breeding goose to goslings is possible.

An unclassified calicivirus (CV) detected in geese was recently reported and proposed as a new member of the family Caliciviridae. There is limited information about the epidemiology, etiology and detection method of goose-origin CV (GCV) to date. In this study, an EvaGreen based fluorescence quantitative real-time RT-PCR assay was developed and optimized for the detection of GCVs. The assay sensitively detected GCV RNA template with a good linear standard curve. We also demonstrated the specificity and reproducibility of the detection method for GCVs. Thus, the method developed in this study will benefit the investigation of possible sporadic outbreaks of CV infections in geese, as well as epidemiological and etiological studies of GCVs.

This is the first description of Tyzzeria parvula from the swan goose (Anser cygnoides) in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Fecal samples were collected from 15 swan geese, but only four of them shed oocysts in feces. After sporulation, the oocysts were spherical to sub-spherical, and measured 12.4 +/- 1.0 (11-15) x 10.4 +/- 0.8 mum (8-12). They presented a shape index of 1.2 (1.0-1.4), with a bi-layered wall that was 0.7 +/- 0.1 mum (0.6-0.8) thick. The outer side was smooth and colorless, while the inner side was pale greenish. Micropyles and polar granules were absent. The residuum sometimes formed a mass of spherules and granules and, at other times, was dispersed. Sporozoites had one rounded end and the other end was fine and slightly curved.

Ferritin heavy chain (FHC), which exhibits ferroxidase activity and mediates the primary functions of ferritin, plays a role in regulating reproduction in animals. However, the changes in the FHC mRNA and protein levels in the HPG axis of geese remain to be determined. In the current study, FHC mRNA expression level was quantitatively monitored in the hypothalamus, anterior pituitary and ovary stroma in prelaying and laying geese. In addition, the levels of FHC mRNA and protein were determined in follicles and ovarian stroma of laying geese. In comparison to prelaying geese, the FHC mRNA expression were 2.4, 1.8, and 13 times higher in the hypothalamus, anterior pituitary and ovarian stroma of laying geese, respectively (p<0.05). FHC mRNA and protein were detected in all examined follicles and ovarian stroma. FHC mRNA expression was higher in postovulatory follicles (POFs) and atretic follicles than in developing follicles and ovarian stroma. Furthermore, the FHC protein concentration in POF3 and atretic follicles were, respectively, 1.45 and 1.7 times higher compared with that of F1 (p<0.05). In conclusion, the presented results provided evidence of a link between FHC and goose reproduction, and supplied a theoretical foundation and a new approach for studying reproduction, in particular ovarian follicular development in birds.

The aim of this trial was to study the influence of loose-mix feeding on behavior, feed intake, and BW of growing geese. In total, 252 one-day-old geese (Anser anser) were divided into 2 groups differing in the form of diet they received between 42 and 98 d of age (AMEn 11.55 MJ/kg, CP 16%): a complete pelleted diet containing 500 g of sorghum/kg (control group) or a mixture containing 500 g of protein-rich pellets and 500 g of sorghum whole seeds/kg (mixed group). Feed intake was measured daily from 42 to 48 d and every 3 d from 49 to 98 d. Individual BW was measured weekly from 42 to 98 d. Goose behavior was monitored by the scan sampling method throughout the experiment, which was divided into 5 periods according to the timing of access to feed: period 1 from 42 to 55 d (ad libitum feeding access), period 2 from 56 to 62 d (2 + 2 h feeding access), period 3 from 63 to 70 d (2 h feeding access), period 4 from 71 to 94 d (1 h feeding access), and period 5 from 95 to 97 d (3 h feeding access). Over the whole period, the feed intake (13,968 and 14,480 g) and the feed conversion ratio (8.53 and 8.15) were similar in both groups (P = 0.112 and P = 0.168; respectively). Body weight was similar in both groups from 42 to 91 d of age, but at 98 d of age, BW was 3.7% lower in the control than in the mixed group (P = 0.006). Goose behavior was influenced by period, because the percentage of birds feeding increased when the daily access time to the feed decreased (P < 0.001), but not by group (P > 0.05). The results suggest that a loose-mix feeding could be recommended in feeding of growing geese because it weakly influences their feed behavior but slightly increases their weight at the end of the growing period.

Published reports and our own diagnostic data on the avian host range of avian Chlamydophila spp. are presented in an attempt to provide evidence for the large number of bird species that have been naturally infected with chlamydia. The term 'chlamydia-positive' is based on either isolation of the organism and antigen detection or on serological detection of circulating antibodies. The list of chlamydia-positive birds contains the six major domestic species (chicken, turkey, Pekin duck, Muscovy duck, goose, and pigeon), the three minor domestic species (Japanese quail, bobwhite quail, and peafowl) and a total of 460 free-living or pet bird species in 30 orders. The order Psittaciformes contains by far the most (153 of 342; 45%) chlamydia-positive bird species. More than 20% of all species per order are positive for chlamydia in the orders Lariformes (gulls, 26 of 92 species; 28%), Alciformes (alks, six of 23 species; 26%), Sphenisciformes (penguins, four of 16 species; 25%), and Anseriformes (ducks and geese, 33 of 157 species; 21%). Only 5% of all bird species (14 of 259 species) in the order Phasianiformes (gallinaceus birds) are chlamydia-positive. The different percentages of chlamydia-positive bird species reflect: (i) a high rate of investigations (e.g. of domestic birds) compared with infrequent testing (e.g. of Charadriiformes or Cuculiformes), (ii) frequent zoonotic implications (e.g. psittacine and columbiform birds), and (iii) an assumed high susceptibility to infection and subsequent seroconversion (e.g. waterfowl).

Avian feces contaminate waterways but contribute fewer human pathogens than human sources. Rapid identification and quantification of avian contamination would therefore be useful to prevent overestimation of human health risk. We used subtractive hybridization of PCR-amplified gull fecal 16S RNA genes to identify avian-specific fecal rRNA gene sequences. The subtracters were rRNA genes amplified from human, dog, cat, cow, and pig feces. Recovered sequences were related to Enterobacteriaceae (47%), Helicobacter (26%), Catellicoccus (11%), Fusobacterium (11%), and Campylobacter (5%). Three PCR assays, designated GFB, GFC, and GFD, were based on recovered sequence fragments. Quantitative PCR assays for GFC and GFD were developed using SYBR green. GFC detected down to 0.1 mg gull feces/100 ml (corresponding to 2 gull enterococci most probable number [MPN]/100 ml). GFD detected down to 0.1 mg chicken feces/100 ml (corresponding to 13 Escherichia coli MPN/100 ml). GFB and GFC were 97% and 94% specific to gulls, respectively. GFC cross-reacted with 35% of sheep samples but occurred at about 100,000 times lower concentrations in sheep. GFD was 100% avian specific and occurred in gulls, geese, chickens, and ducks. In the United States, Canada, and New Zealand, the three markers differed in their geographic distributions but were found across the range tested. These assays detected four important bird groups contributing to fecal contamination of waterways: gulls, geese, ducks, and chickens. Marker distributions across North America and in New Zealand suggest that they will have broad applicability in other parts of the world as well.

Eastern Shore of Virginia red, round tomatoes contaminated with Salmonella serotype Newport pattern JJPX01.0061 have been a source of several multistate outbreaks within the last 10 years. No source of the contamination has yet been identified. The goal of this study was to evaluate wildlife as a potential source of contamination. Faecal samples from deer, turtles and birds were collected between November 2010 and July 2011 from seventeen locations on the Eastern Shore of Virginia. A total of 262 samples were tested for the presence of Salmonella using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A total of 23 (8.8%) samples tested positive for Salmonella spp. and were further characterized by serotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) subtyping. Overall, twelve serotypes were identified, including Salmonella serotype Javiana, another common serotype associated with tomato-related outbreaks. Only one avian sample collected in July 2011 was determined to be positive for S. Newport pattern 61. This sample was collected from the ground at a site where birds, mostly gulls, were congregating. Although many of the avian samples from this site were dry, the site yielded eleven positive Salmonella samples. This suggests that certain Salmonella serotypes may persist in the environment despite extreme conditions. The recovery of one Newport pattern 61 isolate alone does not yield much information regarding the environmental reservoirs of this pathogen, but when combined with other data including the recovery of several isolates of Javiana from birds, it suggests that birds might be a potential source of Salmonella contamination for tomatoes on the Eastern Shore.

Analyses of more than 2000 marked barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) in the largest Baltic colony, Sweden, showed that structurally large females generally produced larger clutches and larger eggs, hatched their broods earlier in the season, and produced more and heavier young than smaller females. In males, the corresponding relationships between reproductive parameters and structural body size were weaker or nonsignificant. Because structural body size traits have previously been found to be significantly heritable and positively genetically correlated, an increase in mean structural body size of individuals as a response to selection might have been expected. By contrast, we found that the mean adult head length and mean adult tarsus length decreased significantly in the largest colony by approximately 0.7 and 0.5 standard deviations, respectively, in both males and females during the 13-year study period. Environmental factors, such as the amount of rain in different years, were found to affect the availability of high-quality food for growing geese. As a consequence of this temporal variability in the availability of high-quality food, the mean adult structural body size of different cohorts differed by up to 1.3 standard deviations. Comparisons of mean body size of cohorts born in different colonies suggest that the most likely explanation for the body-size decline in the main study colony is that a density-dependent process, which mainly was in effect during the very early phase of colony growth, negatively affected juvenile growth and final size. We conclude that large environmental effects on growth and final structural body size easily can mask microevolutionary responses to selection. Analyses of environmental causes underlying temporal and spatial body size variation should always be considered in the reconstruction and prediction of evolutionary changes in natural populations.

We examined matched-tissue samples (the right pectoral muscle plus the associated skin and fat was considered a breast portion) of 81 spring-harvested waterfowl and 19 summer-harvested godwits (Limosa spp.) to assess the potential of these water birds contributing to the body burden of PCBs and DDT noted in First Nation people of the western James Bay region, northern Ontario, Canada. In general, the dabbling ducks (mallard duck, Anas platyrhynchos; and northern pintail, A. acuta) had significantly lower percent lipid (gravimetrically determined) values in skin tissue, fat tissue, and breast muscle compared to the goose species (Canada goose, Branta canadensis; lesser snow goose, Chen caerulescens); godwits had percent lipid values not significantly different than ducks and geese. Also, the percent lipid values in skin for all species of birds examined approached those found in fat tissue. Organochlorine data were expressed as the amount (microg) of each contaminant per breast portion to show contaminant consumption in terms of typical and easily recognizable dietary portions; direct comparisons were made to acceptable daily intake (ADI) or tolerable daily intake (TDI) values as recommended by Health Canada. Significant differences in the amount of organochlorines between bird species for skin, fat tissue, and breast muscle samples were found. In general, breast portions from snow geese contained the least amount of organochlorines, followed by godwits (except for mirex) and then Canada geese; the dabbling ducks had the greatest amount of organochlorines on a breast portion basis. However, on average, no 60 kg person would exceed the calculated organochlorine ADI/TDI values consuming one breast portion (i.e., breast + associated skin and fat), but the maximum value of SigmaPCBs for skin tissue alone in male mallards (47 microg) was more than twice the ADI/TDI (18 microg/day); while, that in fat tissue alone (17 microg) approached the ADI/TDI. Thus, the consumption of dabbling ducks by children is an issue that should be explored further, if tissue other than breast muscle is eaten. Lastly, the consumption of waterfowl was a source of PCBs for people of Fort Albany and Kashechewan, but not DDT, as this organochlorine was infrequently detected.

Dispersal and migratory behavior are influential factors in determining how genetic diversity is distributed across the landscape. In migratory species, genetic structure can be promoted via several mechanisms including fidelity to distinct migratory routes. Particularly within North America, waterfowl management units have been delineated according to distinct longitudinal migratory flyways supported by banding data and other direct evidence. The greater white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons) is a migratory waterfowl species with a largely circumpolar distribution consisting of up to six subspecies roughly corresponding to phenotypic variation. We examined the rangewide population genetic structure of greater white-fronted geese using mtDNA control region sequence data and microsatellite loci from 23 locales across North America and Eurasia. We found significant differentiation in mtDNA between sampling locales with flyway delineation explaining a significant portion of the observed genetic variation (~12%). This is concordant with band recovery data which shows little interflyway or intercontinental movements. However, microsatellite loci revealed little genetic structure suggesting a panmictic population across most of the Arctic. As with many high-latitude species, Beringia appears to have played a role in the diversification of this species. A common Beringian origin of North America and Asian populations and a recent divergence could at least partly explain the general lack of structure at nuclear markers. Further, our results do not provide strong support for the various taxonomic proposals for this species except for supporting the distinctness of two isolated breeding populations within Cook Inlet, Alaska (A. a. elgasi) and Greenland (A. a. flavirostris), consistent with their subspecies status.

The aim of the study was to determine slaughter yield and meat quality of native Zatorska (ZG) goose and compare them to those of commercial hybrid White Koluda® goose (WKG) after fattening in an intensive production system. The experiment was carried out on 500 birds of each group and lasted up to 10 wk of age. The birds were kept on deep litter with access to free range and were fed with the same complete feed mixtures, according to dietary requirements for broiler geese. Body weight, carcass composition, and technological properties of breast and thigh muscles were evaluated (pH24, L*a*b* color, water holding capacity, thermal loss, drip loss, and shear force). In addition, chemical composition of breast and thigh muscles, fatty acid profile of muscle lipids, and amino acids of proteins were determined. The body weight, weight of eviscerated carcass, and dressing percentage of ZG were lower (P < 0.05) than those in WKG. However, breast and thigh muscles of both groups of geese were characterized by similar technological and nutritive values. The differences in meat quality traits concerned only the shear force of breast muscles, with higher values (P < 0.05) for WKG. Moreover, dry matter content in breast muscles of ZG was higher than that in WKG. The effect of goose genotype on the level of oleic acid and monounsaturated fatty acids in breast muscles was shown. Also, the amino acid proportion of meat protein depended on goose breed. Breast muscles of ZG were characterized by higher (P < 0.05) content of some nonessential (Glu, Asp, Ala) and essential amino acids (Val, Thr), and thigh muscles contained less (P < 0.05) Gly, Lys, and Leu and more Pro and Ile than WKG. The present results indicate that the meat of both ZG and WKG broilers showed good technological properties and basic chemical composition and fatty acid profile, and the protein was characterized by high nutritional value. Moreover, the smaller carcasses produced from ZG can better meet the needs of the current market.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the fatty acid profile and health lipid indices of meat from 3 Polish local goose varieties (Romanian-RO, Pomeranian-PO, and Subcarpathian-SB) and the commercial cross White Kołuda goose (W31). Birds were fed ad libitum with the same complete feeds until 17 wk of age. The geese (n = 72) with body weight close to the arithmetic mean in particular flock were fasted for 12 h and slaughtered in an experimental slaughterhouse (18 females in each flock). Carcasses were stored at 2 to 4°C for 24 h. The breast muscles (m. pectoralis major) were cut out from the left side of carcass, separately vacuum-packed, and stored at -80°C until analysis. Fatty acid profile of meat was determined by gas chromatography and health lipid indices were calculated. The W31 muscles had a higher percentage of C 18:0 and a lower of C 16:0 than those of RO, PO, and SB geese. The W31 muscles were characterized by a significantly higher proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids (46.5%) than remaining ones (43.28%-PO, 43.38%-SB, and 44.24%-RO). The lowest proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids was established for W31 muscles (22.05%). The breast muscles of RO, SB, and PO had more favorable polyunsaturated n-6 and n-3 fatty acid (PUFA)/ saturated fatty acid (SFA) ratio (0.85, 0.82, 0.83, respectively) than W31 geese (0.72). The current findings showed that UFA/SFA, PUFA/SFA, and PUFA n-6/n-3 ratios in RO and SB muscles were within the optimum values for human diets. No significant differences were observed in the atherogenic, thrombogenic, and hypocholesterolemic/hypercholesterolemic indices between the analyzed muscles. Commercial W31 geese breast muscles showed a lower value (43.90%) of peroxidizability index (PI) compared to SB (52.88%), PO (53.93%), and RO (53.47%). However, the higher values of the PUFA/SFA and PI in the meat of SB, PO, and RO birds may indicate a higher prohealth value of their meat.

In many parts of the world, conservation successes or global anthropogenic changes have led to increasing native species populations that then compete with human resource use. In the Orkney Islands, Scotland, a 60-fold increase in Greylag Goose Anser anser numbers over 24 years has led to agricultural damages and culling attempts that have failed to prevent population increase. To address uncertainty about why populations have increased, we combined empirical modelling of possible drivers of Greylag Goose population change with expert-elicited benefits of alternative management actions to identify whether to learn versus act immediately to reduce damages by geese. We built linear mixed-effects models relating annual goose densities on farms to land-use and environmental covariates and estimated AICc model weights to indicate relative support for six hypotheses of change. We elicited from experts the expected likelihood that one of six actions would achieve an objective of halting goose population growth, given each hypothesis for population change. Model weights and expected effects of actions were combined in Value of Information analysis (VoI) to quantify the utility of resolving uncertainty in each hypothesis through adaptive management and monitoring. The action with the highest expected value under existing uncertainty was to increase the extent of low quality habitats, whereas assuming equal hypothesis weights changed the best action to culling. VoI analysis showed that the value of learning to resolve uncertainty in any individual hypothesis for goose population change was low, due to high support for a single hypothesis of change. Our study demonstrates a two-step framework that learns about the most likely drivers of change for an over-abundant species, and uses this knowledge to weight the utility of alternative management actions. Our approach helps inform which strategies might best be implemented to resolve uncertainty when there are competing hypotheses for change and competing management choices.

1. Environmental degradation can change resource use strategies of animals and thereby affect survival and fitness. Arctic herbivores may be especially susceptible to the effects of such environmental change because their rapid growth rates demand high-quality forage, which may be limited as environmental conditions deteriorate. We studied the consequences of a trophic cascade, driven by Lesser Snow Goose (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) overgrazing on the south-west coast of Hudson Bay, Canada, which has caused tidal marsh (TM) degradation and the reduction in high-quality forage plants, on gosling growth and resource use. 2. We compared resource use and body size of goslings that inhabited tidal and freshwater marsh (FM) to determine how current foraging strategies influence growth and to test the hypothesis that during early growth goslings require and so consume high-quality TM plants, but that during later growth they may switch to foraging in lower-quality FM. 3. To investigate gosling resource use throughout growth, we measured once a week for 28 days the body size of goslings as well as stable isotope ratios (δ(34) S, δ(15) N and δ(13) C) in multiple tissues of goslings that were collected from both TM and nearby FM. We also measured the stable isotope ratios in forage plants sampled along transects and from gosling foreguts. We used an isotope-mixing model to determine the contribution of FM plants to gosling tissues. 4. Contrary to the proposed hypothesis, goslings inhabiting FM or TM primarily consumed FM plants during early growth. Furthermore, goslings that foraged extensively in FM had similar growth rates and grew to a similar size and body mass, as goslings that foraged in the degraded TM. However, goslings that currently inhabit freshwater or TM were significantly smaller than goslings that inhabited TM in the 1980s prior to habitat degradation. 5. Consequences of smaller overall body size include decreased survival and fecundity for arctic-nesting geese. The ability of phenotypically plastic responses to sustain persistence is limited by reaction norms and the extent of environmental change. Current research is assessing whether those limits have been reached in this system.

Southern China is proposed as an influenza epicentre. At least two of the three pandemics in the last century, including 1957 and 1968 influenza pandemics, originated from this area. In 1996, A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (H5N1), the precursor of currently circulating highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) was identified in farmed geese in southern China. These H5N1 HPAIVs have been spread across Asia, Europe and Africa and poses a continuous threat to both animal and human health. However, how and where this H5N1 HPAIV emerged are not fully understood. In the past decade, many influenza surveillance efforts have been carried out in southern China, and our understanding of the genetic diversity of non-human influenza A viruses in this area has been much better than ever. Here, the historical and first-hand experimental data on A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996(H5N1)-like HPAIVs are reviewed within the context of the findings from recent surveillance efforts on H5N1 HPAIVs and other non-human influenza A viruses. Such a retrospective recapitulation suggests that long-term and systematic surveillance programmes should continue to be implemented in southern China that the wet markets on the animal-human interface shall be the priority area and that the surveillance on the animal species bridging the interface between wildlife and domestic animal populations and the interface between the aquatics and territories shall be the strengthened.

Hypoxia at high altitudes constrains O2 supply to support metabolism, thermoregulation in the cold, and exercise. High-altitude natives that somehow overcome this challenge-who live, reproduce, and sometimes perform impressive feats of exercise at high altitudes-are a powerful group in which to study the evolution of physiological systems underlying hypoxia resistance. Here, we sought to determine whether a common pulse oximetry system for rodents (MouseOx Plus) can be used reliably in studies of high-altitude birds by examining the hypoxia responses of the Andean goose. We compared concurrent measurements of heart rate obtained using pulse oximetry versus electrocardiography. We also compared our measurements of peripheral arterial O2 saturation (SaO2) in uncannulated birds with published data collected from blood samples in birds that were surgically implanted arterial cannulae. Responses to acute hypoxia were measured during stepwise reductions in inspired partial pressure of O2. Andean geese exhibited very modest breathing and heart rate responses to hypoxia but were nevertheless able to maintain normal O2 consumption rates during severe hypoxia exposure down to 5 kPa O2. There were some minor quantitative differences between uncannulated and cannulated birds, which suggest that surgery, cannulation, and/or other sources of variability between studies had modest effects on the hypoxic ventilatory response, heart rate, blood hemoglobin, and hematocrit. Nevertheless, measurements of heart rate and SaO2 by pulse oximetry had small standard errors and were generally concordant and well correlated with measurements using other techniques. We conclude that the MouseOx Plus pulse oximetry system can be a valuable tool for studying the cardiorespiratory physiology of waterfowl without the deleterious effects of surgery/cannulation.

Food availability and diet selection are important factors influencing the abundance and distribution of wild waterbirds. In order to better understand changes in waterbird population, it is essential to figure out what they feed on. However, analyzing their diet could be difficult and inefficient using traditional methods such as microhistologic observation. Here, we addressed this gap of knowledge by investigating the diet of greater white-fronted goose Anser albifrons and bean goose Anser fabalis, which are obligate herbivores wintering in China, mostly in the Middle and Lower Yangtze River floodplain. First, we selected a suitable and high-resolution marker gene for wetland plants that these geese would consume during the wintering period. Eight candidate genes were included: rbcL, rpoC1, rpoB, matK, trnH-psbA, trnL (UAA), atpF-atpH, and psbK-psbI. The selection was performed via analysis of representative sequences from NCBI and comparison of amplification efficiency and resolution power of plant samples collected from the wintering area. The trnL gene was chosen at last with c/h primers, and a local plant reference library was constructed with this gene. Then, utilizing DNA metabarcoding, we discovered 15 food items in total from the feces of these birds. Of the 15 unique dietary sequences, 10 could be identified at specie level. As for greater white-fronted goose, 73% of sequences belonged to Poaceae spp., and 26% belonged to Carex spp. In contrast, almost all sequences of bean goose belonged to Carex spp. (99%). Using the same samples, microhistology provided consistent food composition with metabarcoding results for greater white-fronted goose, while 13% of Poaceae was recovered for bean goose. In addition, two other taxa were discovered only through microhistologic analysis. Although most of the identified taxa matched relatively well between the two methods, DNA metabarcoding gave taxonomically more detailed information. Discrepancies were likely due to biased PCR amplification in metabarcoding, low discriminating power of current marker genes for monocots, and biases in microhistologic analysis. The diet differences between two geese species might indicate deeper ecological significance beyond the scope of this study. We concluded that DNA metabarcoding provides new perspectives for studies of herbivorous waterbird diets and inter-specific interactions, as well as new possibilities to investigate interactions between herbivores and plants. In addition, microhistologic analysis should be used together with metabarcoding methods to integrate this information.

In general, support by social allies may reduce stress, increase success in agonistic encounters and ease access to resources. Social support was mainly known from mammals, particularly primates, and has been studied in birds only recently. Basically two types are known: (i) 'active social support', which describes the participation of a social ally in agonistic encounters, and (ii) 'passive social support' in which the mere presence of a social ally reduces behavioural and physiological stress responses. In greylag geese (Anser anser) offspring stay with their parents for an entire year or even longer and therefore are a candidate avian model to study support by social allies. We investigated the effects of active and passive social support in ten families (ten males, ten females, 33 juveniles) in a free-roaming, semi-tame flock of greylag geese. Focal individuals were observed during three time periods: (i) re-establishment of the flock in the fall, (ii) stable winter flock, and (iii) disintegration of the flock and break-up of family bonds. We recorded all agonistic interactions of the members of one focal family during morning feedings for two consecutive days: a control day, in which food was distributed widely, and a social density stress situation, in which the same amount of food was spread over a much smaller area. In addition, we collected faeces of all individuals within this family for three hours from the beginning of the feeding situation for determining excreted corticosterone immuno-reactive metabolites by enzyme immuno assay. We found that the small families, i.e. pairs with one or two accompanying young, were involved in more agonistic interactions, mainly through the lack of active social support, as compared to large families in the same situation. Members of greylag goose families lost agonistic encounters significantly less often when actively supported. In addition, the excretion of corticosterone metabolites was significantly decreased in large families during a social density stress situation, probably as an effect of passive social support. Via such a socially induced decrease in hormonal stress response during challenging situations, an individual's long term energy management may benefit.

Newcastle disease (ND), caused by virulent strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV), is a highly contagious disease of birds that is responsible for heavy economic losses for the poultry industry worldwide. However, little is known about host-virus interactions in waterfowl, goose. In this study, we aim to characterize the host immune response in goose, based on the previous reports on the host response to NDV in chickens. Here, we evaluated viral replication and mRNA expression of 27 immune-related genes in 10 tissues of geese challenged with a genotype VIId NDV strain of goose origin (go/CH/LHLJ/1/06). The virus showed early replication, especially in digestive and immune tissues. The expression profiles showed up-regulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR)1-3, 5, 7, and 15, avian β-defensin (AvBD) 5-7, 10, 12, and 16, cytokines [interleukin (IL)-8, IL-18, IL-1β, and interferon-γ], inducible NO synthase (iNOS), and MHC class I in some tissues of geese in response to NDV. In contrast, NDV infection suppressed expression of AvBD1 in cecal tonsil of geese. Moreover, we observed a highly positive correlation between viral replication and host mRNA expressions of TLR1-5 and 7, AvBD4-6, 10, and 12, all the cytokines measured, MHC class I, FAS ligand, and iNOS, mainly at 72 h post-infection. Taken together, these results demonstrated that NDV infection induces strong innate immune responses and intense inflammatory responses at early stage in goose which may associate with the viral pathogenesis.

We compared foraging times of female Ross's (Chen rossii) and Lesser Snow Geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) breeding at Karrak Lake, NT, Canada and examined variation due to time of day and reproductive stage. We subsequently collected female geese that had foraged for known duration and we estimated mass of foods consumed during foraging bouts. Female Ross's Geese spent more time foraging (mean % ± SE =28.4±1.3%; P=0.0002), on average, than did female Lesser Snow Geese (21.5 ± 1.4%). Foraging time by female geese differed among reproductive stages, but differences were not consistent among time periods (stage-by-time block interaction, P=0.0003). Females spent considerably more time foraging during prelaying and laying than during incubation. Ross's Geese also spent a greater percent of time feeding (83.0±2.8%) during incubation recesses than did Lesser Snow Geese (60.9±3.6%). Consumption of organic matter during foraging bouts was minimal; estimated consumption averaged 9.6±4.0 and 12.4±4.6 g (mean ± SE) dry mass/day before incubation and 5.9±2.0 and 5.7±2.1 g dry mass/day during incubation for Lesser Snow and Ross's Geese, respectively. Diets consisted primarily of mosses (bryophytes), Chickweed (Stellaria spp.) and Sedges (Carex spp.). Before incubation, eggshell consumption was estimated as 4.3±3.2 and 0.4±0.3 g dry mass/day for Lesser Snow and Ross's Geese, respectively; neither species consumed eggshell during incubation. We conclude that eggshell from nests of previous years is likely an important source of dietary calcium used to meet mineral demands of eggshell formation at Karrak Lake. Our findings of wide disparities between foraging time and food intake indicate that results from studies that do not directly measure intake rates remain equivocal. Finally, we propose four hypotheses accounting for foraging effort that evidently yields little nutritional or energetic benefit to geese nesting at Karrak Lake.

The bird-lemming hypothesis postulates that breeding success of tundra-nesting geese and waders in Siberia follows the cyclic pattern of lemming populations, as a result of predators switching from lemmings to birds when the lemming population crashes. We present 50 years of data on constant-effort catches of red knot Calidris canutus and curlew sandpiper C. ferruginea at an autumn migratory stopover site (Ottenby) at the Baltic Sea, supplemented with literature data on winter censuses of dark-bellied brent goose Branta b. bernicla and white-fronted goose Anser albifrons in northwestern Europe, and waders in Germany and Southern Africa. Number and proportion of juveniles in these bird populations (both our own and literature data) were compared with an index of predation pressure (calculated from the abundance of lemmings on the Taimyr peninsula), and climate indices for the North Eurasia and the North Atlantic regions. The index of predation pressure correlated significantly with the number of juveniles of red knot and curlew sandpiper, but not with number of adults. Also, this index correlated with the reproductive performance of geese and waders reported in the literature. Fourier analysis revealed a significant deviation from random noise with the maximum spectral density at the period length of 3 years for number of juvenile red knots and curlew sandpipers captured at Ottenby, abundance of lemmings, reproduction in arctic fox Alopex lagopus, and reproductive performance in geese on the Siberian tundra. Also, the date of passage at Ottenby for adult red knot and curlew sandpiper showed a spectral density peak at a period length of 3 years, the latter species also showing a peak at a period length of 5-6 years. Passage dates for adult red knot and curlew sandpiper were earlier in years of high predation pressure compared with years of low predation pressure. The fluctuations in reproductive success of the studied Siberian goose and wader species appear to be primarily influenced by biotic factors in the breeding area, rather than by abiotic factors, such as climate oscillations. Annual variations in migratory arctic bird populations may have far reaching effects in habitats along their migration routes and in their wintering areas. We suggest a link between lemming cyclicity in the Northern Hemisphere and predation pressure on Southern Hemisphere benthos, in which the signal is carried between continents by long distance migrating waders.

Elterliches Verhalten und familiäre Nähe als Schlüssel zum Überleben in Graugänsen ( Anser anser ) Der Reproduktionserfolg bei monogamen Arten wird im Allgemeinen von der Feinabstimmung der Paarpartner im Verhalten sowie auf hormoneller Ebene beeinflusst. Wachsamkeit, Verteidigung und das Bebrüten des Nachwuchses gehören zu den wichtigsten Investitionen der Eltern, und oft nehmen die Geschlechter unterschiedliche Rollen ein. In der vorliegenden Studie untersuchten wir, wie sich geschlechtsspezifische Unterschiede im elterlichen Verhalten und die Nähe der Familienmitglieder zueinander in der sozial monogamen Graugans (Anser anser) auf das Überleben der Jungvögel auswirken. Während der Fortpflanzungssaison im Frühjahr 2013 haben wir das Verhalten von 18 Paaren mit Nachkommen und das Überleben der Jungvögel in einer halbzahmen, langzeitüberwachten und individuell markierten Schar von Graugänsen in Grünau/Österreich aufgezeichnet. Wir stellten fest, dass die Differenzierung der Verhaltensrolle zwischen den Eltern mit der Entwicklungsphase der Jungvögel und somit mit deren Alter variierte. Insbesondere während der ersten zehn Tage nach dem Schlüpfen waren Weibchen häufiger auf Nahrungssuche als Männchen, die hingegen wachsamer und aggressiver gegenüber anderen Mitgliedern der Schar waren. Diese Unterschiede zwischen den Geschlechtern glichen sich zwanzig bis dreißig Tage nach dem Schlupf aus. Im Allgemeinen blieben die Weibchen näher bei ihren Nachkommen als die Männchen. Das Überleben der Jungvögel war hoch, wenn die Eltern relativ aggressiv waren und mehr Wert auf Wachsamkeit als auf Nahrungssuche legten. Daher zeigen wir eine direkte Verbindung zwischen der Qualität der elterlichen Investitionen der Paarpartner und dem Überleben der Jungvögel.

In flocks of geese fertility decreases in the second half of the breeding season. The reasons for this reduction in reproduction ability are still unclear. This study measured changes in semen quality variables throughout the period of intensive breeding in relation to hormonal concentrations associated with the sexual activity of ganders. Semen was collected (2×/week) from 2-year-old ganders in the period February-June. Standard ejaculation parameters and spermatozoa (spz) membrane integrity after E/N and SYBR-14/PI staining were evaluated. The DNA Fragmentation Index was measured by flow cytometry and sperm quality factors (SQF). The plasma levels of T, E2, P4, LH, PRL, THs in relation to semen parameters were evaluated. In ejaculate collected at the onset of the second half of breeding (April - spring period), a reduction in sperm concentration and % of liveE/N and liveSYBR-14+/PI- spz was shown. At this time, decrease in concentrations of LH and T and increase in PRL were found as well as moderate changes in THs were observed. However, in May a second peak in T and sperm production occurred. The DFI-% was higher in the middle part of breeding. Gonadal steroids concentration were not good prognostic marker of the reproductive potential of ganders. We suggest that a marked decline in LH and T in the spring period indicated the onset of endocrine changes mediated by PRL and THs resulting in progressive regression of testis functions. The lowest SQF in the spring/summer period coincided with the highest PRL suggesting an anti-spermatogenic action of PRL in ganders.

Although A/Hong Kong/156/97 (H5N1/97)-like viruses associated with the "bird flu" incident in Hong Kong SAR have not been detected since the slaughter of poultry in 1997, its putative precursors continue to persist in the region. One of these, Goose/Guangdong/1/96 (H5N1 Gs/Gd)-like viruses, reassorted with other avian viruses to generate multiple genotypes of H5N1 viruses that crossed to chickens and other terrestrial poultry from its reservoir in geese. Whereas none of these recent reassortants had acquired the gene constellation of H5N1/97, these events provide insight into how such a virus may have been generated. The recent H5N1 reassortants readily infect and kill chicken and quail after experimental infection, and some were associated with significant mortality of chickens within the poultry retail markets in Hong Kong. Some genotypes are lethal for mice after intra-nasal inoculation and spread to the brain. On this occasion, the early detection of H5N1 viruses in the retail, live poultry markets led to preemptive intervention before the occurrence of human disease, but these newly emerging, highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses provide cause for pandemic concern.

In this study, total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations in muscles (leg and breast), organs (intestine, heart, stomach, liver) and blood were investigated for backyard chickens, ducks and geese of the Wanshan Mercury Mine, China. THg in poultry meat products range from 7.9 to 3917.1 ng/g, most of which exceeded the Chinese national standard limit for THg in meat (50 ng/g). Elevated MeHg concentrations (0.4-62.8 ng/g) were also observed in meat products, suggesting that poultry meat can be an important human MeHg exposure source. Ducks and geese showed higher Hg levels than chickens. For all poultry species, the highest Hg concentrations were observed in liver (THg: 23.2-3917.1 ng/g; MeHg: 7.1-62.8 ng/g) and blood (THg: 12.3-338.0 ng/g; MeHg: 1.4-17.6 ng/g). We estimated the Hg burdens in chickens (THg: 15.3-238.1 μg; MeHg: 2.2-15.6 μg), ducks (THg: 15.3-238.1 μg; MeHg: 3.5-14.7 μg) and geese (THg: 83.8-93.4 μg; MeHg: 15.4-29.7 μg). To not exceed the daily intake limit for THg (34.2 μg/day) and MeHg (6 μg/day), we suggested that the maximum amount (g) for chicken leg, breast, heart, stomach, intestine, liver, and blood should be 1384, 1498, 2315, 1214, 1081, 257, and 717, respectively; the maximum amount (g) for duck leg, breast, heart, stomach, intestine, liver, and blood should be 750, 1041, 986, 858, 752, 134, and 573, respectively; and the maximum amount (g) for goose leg, breast, heart, stomach, intestine, liver, and blood should be 941, 1051, 1040, 1131, 964, 137, and 562, respectively.

Avian bornaviruses (ABV) are a recently described group of intranuclear negative-stranded RNA viruses (Order Mononegavirales, Family Bornaviridae). At least 13 different ABV genotypes have been described. One genotype, the Canada goose genotype (ABV-CG), has been isolated from geese and swans and is widely distributed across North America.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of active immunization against recombinant Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) protein on the ovarian follicular development, egg production, and molecular regulatory mechanisms in broody-prone Zhedong White geese. For this, a recombinant goose AMH protein was expressed using a prokaryotic expression system. Fifty incubating geese from the same genetic background were selected and equally divided into two groups. The immunization group was actively immunized against the recombinant goose AMH protein, whereas the control group was immunized against bovine serum albumin (BSA). Immunization against AMH accelerated ovarian follicular development and increased clutch sizes by one to two eggs in two consecutive laying-incubation cycles. Furthermore, immunization against AMH upregulated the mRNA transcription levels of the FSH-beta gene in the pituitary gland, and FSHR, 3beta-HSD, and Smad4 genes in the granulosa layer of pre-ovulatory follicles; however, immunization downregulated the expression of the OCLN gene in the granulosa layer of pre-ovulatory follicles, and Smad5 and Smad9 genes in the granulosa layer of SYFs. These results suggest that AMH might hinder ovarian follicular development by decreasing both pituitary FSH secretion as well as ovarian follicular sensitivity to FSH. The latter molecular mechanism could be fulfilled by regulating Smad5 or Smad9 signals in SYFs, as well as the FSHR and Smad4 signals that affect progesterone synthesis and yolk deposition in the pre-ovulatory follicles.

The parakeratinized epithelium is a common epithelium in the oral cavity in birds and is characterized by the presence of cell nuclei in the cells of the cornified layer. This epithelium covers almost the entire dorsal surface of the tongue in the domestic goose apart of the lingual nail and conical papillae. So far no study has identified the molecular proteins alpha-keratin (IF-keratin) and/or corneous beta protein (CBP), which are responsible for keratinization or cornification processes in the parakeratinized epithelium of domestic geese. The study was performed using immunohistochemical (IHC) methods to identify alpha-keratin. The innovative method of Raman microspectroscopy was used to determine the presence of CBP and specify their percentage in epithelial layers of the parakeratinized epithelium. The results revealed that alpha-keratin is present in the whole parakeratinized epithelium. A strong staining reaction was detected in the basal and intermediate layers and a less strong staining reaction in the cornified layer. Raman microspectroscopy analysis confirmed the presence of alpha-keratin and demonstrated that its percentage decreases from the basal layer to the cornified layer. The Raman microspectroscopy technique revealed the occurrence of CBP in the parakeratinized epithelium and demonstrated that the percentage of this protein increases from the basal layer to the cornified layer. Performed analysis determines that parakeratinized epithelium undergoes cornification. However, the lower percentage of CBP in the cornified layer of parakeratinized epithelium than in orthokeratinized epithelium points to the fact that parakeratinized epithelium has a weaker protective function.

Reed (Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud.) beds are important habitat for marsh birds, but are declining throughout Europe. Increasing numbers of the native marsh bird, the Greylag goose (Anser anser L.), are hypothesized to cause reed bed decline and inhibit restoration of reed beds, but data are largely lacking. In this study, we experimentally tested the effect of grazing by Greylag geese on the growth and expansion of reed growing in belts along lake shorelines. After 5 years of protecting reed from grazing with exclosures, reed stems were over 4-fold denser and taller than in the grazed plots. Grazing pressure was intense with 50-100% of the stems being grazed among years in the control plots open to grazing. After 5 years of protection we opened half of the exclosures and the geese immediately grazed almost 100% of the reed stems. Whereas this did not affect the reed stem density, the stem height was strongly reduced and similar to permanently grazed reed. The next year geese were actively chased away by management from mid-March to mid-June, which changed the maximum amount of geese from over 2300 to less than 50. As a result, reed stem density and height increased and the reed belt had recovered over the full 6 m length of the experimental plots. Lastly, we introduced reed plants in an adjacent lake where no reed was growing and geese did visit this area. After two years, the density of the planted reed was six to nine-fold higher and significantly taller in exclosures compared to control plots where geese had access to the reed plants. We conclude that there is a conservation dilemma regarding how to preserve and restore reed belts in the presence of high densities of Greylag geese as conservation of both reed belts and high goose numbers seems infeasible. We suggest that there are three possible solutions for this dilemma: (1) effects of the geese can be mediated by goose population management, (2) the robustness of the reed marshes can be increased, and (3) at the landscape level, spatial planning can be used to configure landscapes with large reed bed reserves surrounded by unmown, unfertilized meadows.

Anatipestifer disease is a contagious disease caused by Riemerella anatipestifer, affecting primarily ducks, geese and turkeys, and characterised by listlessness, diarrhoea, sneezing, nasal discharge, and nervous signs. Sporadically, it occurs in a wide range of other domesticated and wild birds as well. The incidence and characteristics of the disease seen in the three main host species are summarised based on birds submitted for routine laboratory investigation in Hungary over the period 2010-2014. The infection was diagnosed in a higher percentage in geese (9.9%) and ducks (7.5%). It occurred in 5-day-old to 17-week-old geese and 3- to 6.5-week-old ducks, respectively. The pathological lesions were comparable in these two species: enlarged spleen, serofibrinous pericarditis, perihepatitis, airsacculitis, catarrhal enteritis, subcutaneous oedema and hyperaemia over the cranium, mucopurulent exudate in the nasal cavity and occasionally pneumonia, conjunctivitis, purulent arthritis and caseous salpingitis. In some cases, R. anatipestifer produced only secondary lesions, which complicated other diseases such as circovirus infection, mycotoxicosis, mycoplasmosis, or Derzsy's disease. In turkeys, the disease occurred rarely (0.5%) and at an older age (12 to 19 weeks). The lesions most frequently seen were purulent osteomyelitis of the cranium and seropurulent meningitis. Purulent osteomyelitis in the cranium caused by R. anatipestifer infection had not been reported in turkeys previously. To various extents, other local lesions such as serofibrinous pericarditis, airsacculitis, arthritis, and in one case septicaemia were also observed. The high incidence of the disease in waterfowl underlines the importance of appropriate treatment and prevention that should be based on accurate diagnosis and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, proper biosecurity and vaccination with regard to the serotype(s) present on the farm.

Determining the manner in which food webs will respond to environmental changes is difficult because the relative importance of top-down vs. bottom-up forces in controlling ecosystems is still debated. This is especially true in the Arctic tundra where, despite relatively simple food webs, it is still unclear which forces dominate in this ecosystem. Our primary goal was to assess the extent to which a tundra food web was dominated by plant-herbivore or predator-prey interactions. Based on a 17-year (1993-2009) study of terrestrial wildlife on Bylot Island, Nunavut, Canada, we developed trophic mass balance models to address this question. Snow Geese were the dominant herbivores in this ecosystem, followed by two sympatric lemming species (brown and collared lemmings). Arctic foxes, weasels, and several species of birds of prey were the dominant predators. Results of our trophic models encompassing 19 functional groups showed that <10% of the annual primary production was consumed by herbivores in most years despite the presence of a large Snow Goose colony, but that 20-100% of the annual herbivore production was consumed by predators. The impact of herbivores on vegetation has also weakened over time, probably due to an increase in primary production. The impact of predators was highest on lemmings, intermediate on passerines, and lowest on geese and shorebirds, but it varied with lemming abundance. Predation of collared lemmings exceeded production in most years and may explain why this species remained at low density. In contrast, the predation rate on brown lemmings varied with prey density and may have contributed to the high-amplitude, periodic fluctuations in the abundance of this species. Our analysis provided little evidence that herbivores are limited by primary production on Bylot Island. In contrast, we measured strong predator-prey interactions, which supports the hypothesis that this food web is primarily controlled by top-down forces. The presence of allochthonous resources subsidizing top predators and the absence of large herbivores may partly explain the predominant role of predation in this low-productivity ecosystem.

Geese, as aquatic birds, are an important natural reservoir of avian influenza virus (AIV). To characterize the innate antiviral immune response against AIV H9N2 strain infection in geese as well as the probable relationship between the expression of immune-related genes and the distribution of viral antigens, we investigated the levels of immune-related gene transcription both in AIV H9N2 strain-infected geese and in vitro. The patterns of viral location and the tissue distribution of CD4- and CD8α-positive cells were concurrently detected by immunohistochemical staining, which revealed respiratory and digestive organs as the primary sites of antigen-positive signals. Average AIV H9N2 viral loads were detected in the feces, Harderian gland (HG), and trachea, where higher copy numbers were detected compared with the rectum. Our results suggested the strong induction of proinflammatory cytokine expression compared with interferons (IFNs). Notably, in most tissues from the AIV H9N2 strain-infected birds, IFNα and IFNγ gene transcripts were differentially expressed. However, inverse changes in IFNα and IFNγ expression after AIV H9N2 strain infection were observed in vitro. Taken together, the results suggest that AIV H9N2 is widely distributed in multiple tissues, efficiently induces inflammatory cytokines in the HG and spleen of goslings and inversely influences type I and II IFN expression both in vivo and in vitro. The findings of this study further our understanding of host defense mechanisms and the pathogenesis of the H9N2 influenza virus in geese.

In this study, 19 chickens were experimentally infected by Leishmania infantum and tissue samples, collected at different times, were cultured and subjected to conventional PCR and/or real time PCR (qPCR) to assess their susceptibility to infection. In addition, 121 serum samples from rural chickens (n=73) and backyard birds (n=48) were tested for anti-L. infantum antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence test. All the 19 animals showed to be molecularly positive at least at one tissue sample. In particular, 26 tissue samples from the experimentally infected chickens were positive on conventional PCR and/or qPCR but no clinical signs or seroconversion were detected and all tissue cultures were negative. Accordingly, all serum samples from rural chickens were negative whereas four (8.4%) from game birds (three Anser anser and one Phasianus colchicus) were positive. These results indicate that chickens are not suitable hosts for L. infantum under experimental condition. The occurrence of anti-L. infantum antibodies in domestic gooses (A. anser) and in a pheasant (P. colchicus) points out their possible role in the epidemiology of visceral leishmaniasis.

鸭疫里默氏杆菌 (Riemerella anatipestifer，RA) 是引起鸭、鹅、火鸡等家禽传染性败血症及浆膜炎的主要病原。目前主要通过基因缺失及基因回补的方法对鸭疫里默氏杆菌的基因功能进行研究。然而，目前使用的穿梭质粒pLMF03 存在结合转移效率低、酶切位点少等缺陷，不能用于所有鸭疫里默氏杆菌基因的回补。为解决这一问题，文中将结合转移位点oriT、鸭疫里默氏杆菌复制起始基因pRA0726 ori、高表达启动子基因及多种酶切位点逐一克隆至质粒pPM5，构建了新的穿梭质粒pFY02。结果表明，该质粒能够稳定存在于鸭疫里默氏杆菌，且具有较高的结合转移效率。通过回补鸭疫里默氏杆菌tonB2 基因缺失株表明，该质粒可用于鸭疫里默氏杆菌基因的回补。总之，文中构建的穿梭质粒pFY02 更加完善了用于鸭疫里默氏杆菌基因回补的材料。.

In this study, we develop a reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for rapid and easy detection of goose astroviruses (GAstVs) in clinical samples. The specific LAMP primer sets were designed targeting the ORF2 gene of GAstV. The conditions of LAMP amplification were optimized in terms of reaction time and temperature. The optimal conditions are 60 min in a 60 °C water bath. No cross-reactivity was noted with fowl adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV-4), duck tembusu virus (DTMUV), goose parvovirus (GPV), avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), or chicken anemia virus (CAV). The proposed RT-LAMP method was compared with conventional RT polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and with nested RT-PCR. The results showed that the sensitivity of the proposed method was comparable to that of nested RT-PCR and tenfold higher than that of the conventional RT-PCR. Clinical samples (N = 129) of the liver and kidney from sick geese collected from six commercial goose farms were tested. The positive rate was 39.5% (51/129), 38.8% (50/129), and 34.9% (45/129) using RT-LAMP, nested RT-PCR and conventional RT-PCR, respectively. The developed RT-LAMP diagnostic method is not only simple, rapid, and highly specific, but also portable for use on the field. It may be used in epidemiological investigation to detect GAstVs.

Twenty Far East Greylag Geese Anser anser rubrirostris were captured and fitted with GPS/GSM loggers to identify breeding and wintering areas, migration routes and stopover sites. Telemetry data for the first time showed linkages between their Yangtze River wintering areas, stopover sites in northeastern China and breeding/molting grounds in eastern Mongolia and northeast China. Ten of the twenty tagged individuals that provided sufficient data stopped on migration at the Yellow River Estuary, Beidagang Reservoir and Xar Moron River confirming these areas as being important stopover sites for this population. The median spring migration duration was 33.7 days (individuals started between 25 February and 16 March and completed 1-9 April) compared to 52.7 days in autumn (26 September-13 October until 4 November-11 December). Median stopover duration was 31.1 and 51.3 days and median speed of travel was 62.6 and 47.9 km/day for spring and autumn migration, respectively. The significant differences between spring and autumn migration on the migration duration, stopover duration and the migration speed confirmed that tagged adult Greylag Geese travelled faster in spring than autumn, supporting the hypothesis that they should be more time-limited during spring migration.

Geese are extremely well-adapted to utilizing plant-derived roughage in their diet, so the grass must be added to commercial diets under intensive rearing systems. However, it is unclear whether the gut microbiota will change significantly when adding different proportions of ryegrass. In this study, 240 healthy male Yangzhou geese (28 days old) with similar body weights were randomly divided into four groups and fed different proportions grass (CK, whole commercial diets; EG1, ryegrass: commercial diets = 1.5:1; EG2, ryegrass: commercial diets = 2:1; EG3, ryegrass: commercial diets = 3:1) respectively. When the geese grew to 70 days old, their intestines were collected and high-throughput sequencing technology was performed to investigate the microbial diversity in the caecum of geese with different dietary supplements. There was no obvious change in the alpha diversity of gut microbiota of geese with ryegrass intake (P > 0.05) and the composition of dominant bacterium (including Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes) was also similar. However, the ratio between Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes was remarkably reduced with ryegrass intake (P < 0.05), and the relative abundance of 30 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) significantly differed. Additionally, the content of cellulose-degrading microbiota such as Ruminiclostridium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010 were significantly increased in geese fed with increasing amounts of grass. Finally, the functional profiles of the goose gut microbiota were explored using the PICRUSt tool. Carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism were dominant metabolic pathways. Lipid metabolism was significantly increased in EG3 compared that in the CK group (P < 0.05). Interestingly, Turicibacter and Parasutterella may have affected abdominal fat deposition as grass intake increased. Taken together, although the diversity of bacterial communities was similar in geese fed with different proportions of ryegrass, cellulose-degrading microbiota (Ruminiclostridium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010) were abundant and the lipid metabolic pathway was enriched, which may reduce abdominal fat accumulation in high-ryegrass fed geese.

Regular, long-distance migrations of thousands of animal species have consequences for the ecosystems that they visit, modifying trophic interactions and transporting many non-pathogenic and pathogenic organisms. The spatial structure and dynamic properties of animal migrations and population flyways largely determine those trophic and transport effects, but are yet poorly studied. As a basis, we propose a periodic Markov model on the spatial migration network of breeding, stopover and wintering sites to formally describe the process of animal migration on the population level. From seasonally changing transition rates we derived stable, seasonal densities of animals at the network nodes. We parametrized the model with high-quality GPS and satellite telemetry tracks of white storks (Ciconia ciconia) and greater white-fronted geese (Anser a. albifrons). Topological and network flow properties of the two derived networks conform to migration properties like seasonally changing connectivity and shared, directed movement. Thus, the model realistically describes the migration movement of complete populations and can become an important tool to study the effects of climate and habitat change and pathogen spread on migratory animals. Furthermore, the property of periodically changing transition rates makes it a new type of complex model and we need to understand its dynamic properties.

Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), an important pattern recognition receptor, activates proinflammatory pathways in response to various pathogens. It has been reported in humans and chicken, but not in geese, an important waterfowl species in China. Since some vaccines stimulate robust immune responsesl in chicken but not in geeeses we speculated that their immune systems are different.

Since the isolation of A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (H5N1) in farmed geese in southern China, highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses have posed a continuous threat to both public and animal health. The non-synonymous mutation of the H5 hemagglutinin (HA) gene has resulted in antigenic drift, leading to difficulties in both clinical diagnosis and vaccine strain selection. Characterizing H5N1's antigenic profiles would help resolve these problems. In this study, a novel sparse learning method was developed to identify antigenicity-associated sites in influenza A viruses on the basis of immunologic data sets (i.e., from hemagglutination inhibition and microneutralization assays) and HA protein sequences. Twenty-one potential antigenicity-associated sites were identified. A total of 17 H5N1 mutants were used to validate the effects of 11 of these predicted sites on H5N1's antigenicity, including 7 newly identified sites not located in reported antibody binding sites. The experimental data confirmed that mutations of these tested sites lead to changes in viral antigenicity, validating our method.

Cottonseed meal (CSM), which is an unconventional protein material with abundant sources, high protein content, and a relatively cheap price, can be used in poultry diets. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of CSM on slaughter performance, meat quality and meat chemical composition in Jiangnan White goslings. A total of 300 healthy 28-day-old male goslings were randomly divided into 5 treatments, with 6 pens containing 10 geese each. Five isonitrogenous and isocaloric experimental diets were formulated such that 0% (a corn-soybean meal basal diet, control), 25% (CSM25), 50% (CSM50), 75% (CSM75), and 100% (CSM100) protein from soybean meal was replaced with CSM (corresponding to 0, 6.73, 13.46, 20.18, and 26.91% CSM in the feed, respectively). On day 70, 1 goose from each pen (6 geese per treatment) was randomly selected and killed to measure the slaughter performance, meat quality, and the meat amino acid (AA) and fatty acid (FA) compositions. The results showed that dietary CSM did not affect the slaughter performance or meat quality of geese (P > 0.05). The fat content of breast muscle in the CSM100 group was higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). A concentration of 13.46% or more dietary CSM increased the threonine content but decreased the cysteine content, and 20.18% dietary CSM also decreased the valine content (P < 0.05). Dietary CSM concentration had no effect on the content of total saturated FAs (SFAs, P > 0.05), but 20.18 and 26.91% dietary CSM increased the content of total monounsaturated FAs and decreased the content of total polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) and PUFA/SFA in the breast muscle of geese (P < 0.05). In conclusion, dietary CSM did not affect the slaughter performance or meat quality of geese, but the replacement of soybean meal with CSM in whole or high proportion altered the composition of AAs and FAs in breast muscle.

Les changements climatiques peuvent avoir un impact sur les écosystèmes au travers des modifications de la dynamique d'exploitation des ressources par les prédateurs et leurs proies. Dans le cas de l'Arctique, caractérisée par un réseau trophique simple et une sensibilité marquée au réchauffement climatique, l'altération de ces relations trophiques pourrait être particulièrement importante. Cependant, la quantification des nombreux liens directs et indirects à travers lesquels les changements climatiques peuvent affecter les interactions trophiques demeure un défi. Notre objectif est d'identifier les mécanismes causaux directs et indirects, sous-tendus par le climat, affectant les interactions prédateur-proie au sein d'un réseau trophique au cœur de la toundra. Notre étude se base sur les relations entre un prédateur (renard arctique) et ses deux proies principales -le lemming (proie préférée) et la grande oie des neiges (proie alternative)- et qui subissent un accroissement des précipitations et des températures au travers des années. Nous avons utilisé une combinaison de modèles illustrant les liens causaux multiples entre les variables clés issues d'une base de données à long-terme (21 ans). Nous avons obtenu plusieurs scénarios possibles reliant les facteurs climatiques régionaux (Oscillation Arctique) et les températures et précipitations locales à la reproduction de nos 3 espèces. Nos résultats suggèrent que les facteurs climatiques régionaux et locaux présentent des impacts directs et indirects sur la reproduction du renard arctique et de l'oie des neiges. Le climat local présente un lien causal positif avec le succès de nidification de l'oie, alors que le climat local et régional démontrent un effet contrasté sur la proportion de renard en reproduction. Aucune relation entre les facteurs climatiques et l'abondance des lemmings n'a été trouvée. Nous avons observé des liens causaux positifs entre la reproduction du lemming, du renard et de l'oie, mettant en évidence les réponses numériques et fonctionnelles du renard arctique face à la variabilité de l'abondance de lemming. Notre étude est une des premières à mesurer les liens causaux et les forces d'interaction entre les espèces partageant un même réseau trophique, quantifiant ainsi la réponse numérique du prédateur et les interactions apparentes entre ses proies principales. Ces résultats améliorent notre compréhension des effets complexes du climat sur les interactions prédateur-proie et notre capacité à anticiper la réponse des réseaux trophiques aux changements climatiques en cours.

Since 2005, clade 2.2 H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses have caused infections and morbidity among numerous species of wild waterfowl in Eurasia and Africa. However, outbreaks associated with clade 2.3.2 viruses have increased since 2009, and viruses within this clade have become the dominant strain of the H5N1 HPAI virus detected in wild birds, reaching endemic status in domestic birds in select regions of Asia. To address questions regarding the emergence and expansion of clade 2.3.2 viruses, 2 waterfowl species repeatedly involved in outbreaks of H5N1 HPAI viruses, bar-headed geese (Anser indicus) and ruddy shelducks (Tadorna ferruginea), were inoculated with a representative virus. All of 3 infected ruddy shelducks exhibited neurologic signs and died within 4 to 5 days. Two of 3 infected bar-headed geese had transient weakness but all survived. Viral shedding was predominately via the oropharynx and was detected from 1 to 7 days after inoculation. The severity and distribution of microscopic lesions corresponded with clinical disease and influenza-specific immunohistochemical staining of neurons. The predominant lesions were in the brain and were more severe in ruddy shelducks. Increased caspase-3 reactivity in the brains of all infected birds suggests a role for apoptosis in H5N1 HPAI virus pathogenesis in these species. These results demonstrate that similar to clade 2.2 viruses, a clade 2.3.2 H5N1 HPAI virus is neurotropic in some waterfowl species and can lead to neurologic disease with varying clinical outcomes. This has implications for the role that wild waterfowl may play in transmission of this virus in endemic regions.

Goose parvovirus (GPV) continues to be a threat to goose farms and has significant economic effects on the production of geese. Current commercially available vaccines only rarely prevent GPV infection. In our study, Lactobacillus (L.) plantarum NC8 was selected as a vector to express the VP2 gene of GPV, and recombinant L. plantarum pSIP409-VP2/NC8 was successfully constructed. The molecular weight of the expressed recombinant protein was approximately 70 kDa. Mice were immunized with a 2 × 109 colony-forming unit/200 μL dose of the recombinant L. plantarum strain, and the ratios and numbers of CD11c+, CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+, and interferon gamma- and tumor necrosis factor alpha-expressing spleen lymphocytes in the pSIP409-VP2/NC8 group were higher than those in the control groups. In addition, we assessed the capacity of L. plantarum SIP409-VP2/NC8 to induce secretory IgA production. We conclude that administered pSIP409-VP2/NC8 leads to relatively extensive cellular responses. This study provides information on GPV infection and offers a clear framework of options available for GPV control strategies.

Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), a cytosolic pattern recognition receptor (PRR), can sense various RNA viruses, including the avian influenza virus (AIV) and infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), and trigger the innate immune response. Previous studies have shown that mammalian RIG-I (human and mice) and waterfowl RIG-I (ducks and geese) are essential for type I interferon (IFN) synthesis during AIV infection. Like ducks, pigeons are also susceptible to infection but are ineffective propagators and disseminators of AIVs, i.e., "dead end" hosts for AIVs and even highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Consequently, we sought to identify pigeon RIG-I and investigate its roles in the detection of A/Chicken/Shandong/ZB/2007 (H9N2) (ZB07), Gansu/Tianshui (IBDV TS) and Beijing/CJ/1980 (IBDV CJ-801) strains in chicken DF-1 fibroblasts or human 293T cells. Pigeon mRNA encoding the putative pigeon RIG-I analogs was identified. The exogenous expression of enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP)-tagged pigeon RIG-I and caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs), strongly induced antiviral gene (IFN-β, Mx, and PKR) mRNA synthesis, decreased viral gene (M gene and VP2) mRNA expression, and reduced the viral titers of ZB07 and IBDV TS/CJ-801 virus strains in chicken DF-1 cells, but not in 293T cells. We also compared the antiviral abilities of RIG-I proteins from waterfowl (duck and goose) and pigeon. Our data indicated that waterfowl RIG-I are more effective in the induction of antiviral genes and the repression of ZB07 and IBDV TS/CJ-801 strain replication than pigeon RIG-I. Furthermore, chicken melanoma differentiation associated gene 5(MDA5)/ mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) silencing combined with RIG-I transfection suggested that pigeon RIG-I can restore the antiviral response in MDA5-silenced DF-1 cells but not in MAVS-silenced DF-1 cells. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that pigeon RIG-I and CARDs have a strong antiviral ability against AIV H9N2 and IBDV in chicken DF-1 cells but not in human 293T cells.

In Poland, the leader in goose production in Europe, goose parovirus infection, or Derzsy's disease (DD), must be reported to the veterinary administration due to the serious economic and epizootic threat to waterfowl production. Prophylactic treatment for DD includes attenuated live or inactivated vaccines. Moreover, the control of DD includes the monitoring of maternal derived antibody (MDA) levels in the offspring and antibody titers in the parent flock after vaccination. The aim of this study was to develop an ELISA for the detection of goose parvovirus (GPV) antibodies.

Aqueous extracts from smooth muscles of the stomachs of geese and ducks contain enzyme systems which not only oxidize free D-glucose, but also determine its further metabolism. The successive metabolites are probably 1,5-D-gluconolactone and 2-ketogluconic acid, and the final product is either pyruvic acid of alpha-ketoglutaric acid. Better understanding of this metabolism will require further studies.

Despite the existence of 10 avian paramyxovirus (APMV) serotypes, very little is known about the distribution, host species, and ecological factors affecting virus transmission. To better understand the relationship among these factors, we conducted APMV wild bird surveillance in regions of Ukraine suspected of being intercontinental (north to south and east to west) flyways. Surveillance for APMV was conducted in 6,735 wild birds representing 86 species and 8 different orders during 2006 to 2011 through different seasons. Twenty viruses were isolated and subsequently identified as APMV-1 (n = 9), APMV-4 (n = 4), APMV-6 (n = 3), and APMV-7 (n = 4). The highest isolation rate occurred during the autumn migration (0.61%), with viruses isolated from mallards, teals, dunlins, and a wigeon. The rate of isolation was lower during winter (December to March) (0.32%), with viruses isolated from ruddy shelducks, mallards, white-fronted geese, and a starling. During spring migration, nesting, and postnesting (April to August) no APMV strains were isolated out of 1,984 samples tested. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of four APMV-1 and two APMV-4 viruses showed that one APMV-1 virus belonging to class 1 was epidemiologically linked to viruses from China, three class II APMV-1 viruses were epidemiologically connected with viruses from Nigeria and Luxembourg, and one APMV-4 virus was related to goose viruses from Egypt. In summary, we have identified the wild bird species most likely to be infected with APMV, and our data support possible intercontinental transmission of APMVs by wild birds.

Active serologic surveillance is necessary to control the spread of the avian influenza virus (AIV). In this study, we evaluated a commercially-available cELISA in terms of its ability to detect AIV antibodies in the sera of 3,358 animals from twelve species. cELISA detected antibodies against reference H1- through H15-subtype AIV strains without cross reactivity. Furthermore, the cELISA was able to detect antibodies produced following a challenge of the AIV H9N2 subtype in chickens, or following vaccination of the AIV H9 or H5 subtypes in chickens, ducks and geese. Next, we tested the sensitivity and specificity of the cELISA with sera from twelve different animal species, and compared these results with those obtained by the hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test, the "gold standard" in AIV sera surveillance, a second commercially-available cELISA (IZS ELISA), or the agar gel precipitation (AGP) test. Compared with the HI test, the sensitivities and specificities of cELISA were 95% and 96% in chicken, 86% and 88% in duck, 97% and 100% in turkey, 100% and 87% in goose, and 91% and 97% in swine, respectively. The sensitivities and specificities of the cELISA in this study were higher than those of IZS ELISA for the duck, turkey, goose, and grey partridge sera samples. The results of AGP test against duck and turkey sera also showed significant correlation with the results of cELISA (R-value >0.9). In terms of flock sensitivity, the cELISA correlated better with the HI test than with commercially-available indirect ELISAs, with 100% flock sensitivity.

Zoonotic highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) have raised serious public health concerns of a novel pandemic. These strains emerge from low-pathogenic precursors by the acquisition of a polybasic hemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site, the prime virulence determinant. However, required coadaptations of the HA early in HPAIV evolution remained uncertain. To address this question, we generated several HA1/HA2 chimeras and point mutants of an H5N1 clade 2.2.2 HPAIV and an H5N1 low-pathogenic strain. Initial surveys of 3,385 HPAIV H5 HA sequences revealed frequencies of 0.5% for the single amino acids 123R and 124I but a frequency of 97.5% for the dual combination. This highly conserved dual motif is still retained in contemporary H5 HPAIV, including the novel H5NX reassortants carrying neuraminidases of different subtypes, like the H5N8 and the zoonotic H5N6 strains. Remarkably, the earliest Asian H5N1 HPAIV, the Goose/Guangdong strains from 1996/1997, carried 123R only, whereas 124I appeared later in 1997. Experimental reversion in the HPAIV HA to the two residues 123S and124T, characteristic of low-pathogenic strains, prevented virus rescue, while the single substitutions attenuated the virus in both chicken and mice considerably, accompanied by a decreased HA fusion pH. This increased pH sensitivity of H5 HPAIV enables HA-mediated membrane fusion at a higher endosomal pH. Therefore, this HA adaptation may permit infection of cells with less-acidic endosomes, e.g., within the respiratory tract, resulting in an extended organ tropism. Taken together, HA coadaptation to increased acid sensitivity promoted the early evolution of H5 Goose/Guangdong-like HPAIV strains and is still required for their zoonotic potential.IMPORTANCE Zoonotic highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) have raised serious public health concerns of a novel pandemic. Their prime virulence determinant is the polybasic hemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site. However, required coadaptations in the HA (and other genes) remained uncertain. Here, we identified the dual motif 123R/124I in the HA head that increases the activation pH of HA-mediated membrane fusion, essential for virus genome release into the cytoplasm. This motif is extremely predominant in H5 HPAIV and emerged already in the earliest 1997 H5N1 HPAIV. Reversion to 123S or 124T, characteristic of low-pathogenic strains, attenuated the virus in chicken and mice, accompanied by a decreased HA activation pH. This increased pH sensitivity of H5 HPAIV extends the viral tropism to cells with less-acidic endosomes, e.g., within the respiratory tract. Therefore, early HA adaptation to increased acid sensitivity promoted the emergence of H5 Goose/Guangdong-like HPAIV strains and is required for their zoonotic potential.

Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase, a normally mitochondrial enzyme, accumulates in the cytoplasm of specialized glands to cause production of multiple methyl-branched fatty acids. Evidence was presented that a single copy of the decarboxylase gene present in the goose genome codes for both the mitochondrial form found in extremely low amounts in the liver and the cytosolic form found in large amounts in uropygial glands. To elucidate how a single gene encodes both forms, the malonyl-CoA decarboxylase gene and the cDNAs for both the mitochondrial (liver) and the cytoplasmic (gland) species were cloned and sequenced. The decarboxylase gene, found in a 21-kb segment of cloned genomic DNA, is composed of five exons of 0.521, 0.118, 0.156, 0.145, and 1.93 kb interrupted by 6.9, 1.5, 0.45, and 9.3-kb introns. Exon 1 revealed two ATGs in frame 150 bp apart. cDNA for the cytoplasmic form and mitochondrial form showed identical nucleotide sequence, except that the latter was longer than the former. The longest cDNA for the cytoplasmic form of the enzyme extended only 44 bp 5' to the second ATG and the position corresponded to the transcription initiation site of the cytoplasmic form revealed by primer extension and RNase protection. The cDNA for the mitochondrial form isolated from the library extended 19 bp further upstream. Primer extension and RNase protection indicated that transcripts for the mitochondrial form initiated upstream from the first ATG. The N-terminal segment of the open reading frame initiated at the first ATG showed an amphipathic signal sequence appropriate for mitochondrial import. A putative full length mRNA for the mitochondrial form of the enzyme when translated in vitro yielded a 55-kDa primary translation product which was processed by removal of about 5 kDa during uptake into goose liver mitochondria. These results strongly suggest that in most tissues transcription initiates 5'- to the first ATG, generating a transcript that would generate a protein with an N-terminal leader for transport into mitochondria. In the uropygial gland the use of an alternate promoter generates transcripts initiated between the two ATGs and the translation product accumulates in the cytoplasm since it lacks a mitochondrial targeting sequence.

1. Activity of a cytoplasmic 5'-nucleotidase which preferentially hydrolyzes IMP and GMP (IMP-GMP 5'-nucleotidase) was determined by a specific immunochemical method in two species of birds and two species of mammals. 2. The activity was markedly high in avian liver, and it increased two-fold in response to a high protein diet in chicken liver. 3. In mammals, the activity was high in testis and spleen. In the rat, the activities in liver, kidney and heart extracts increased by about 30% in response to the high protein diet, while they increased three-fold in regenerating liver. 4. Low activities were detected in skeletal muscles and in erythrocytes of all the species studied.

The VP3-encoding gene of goose parvovirus (GPV) Ep22 strain was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The GPV VP3-encoding gene was 1605 bp in length, and it encoded a 534 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 59.9 kDa. The VP3 fusion protein expressed in E. coli was detected by goose and Muscovy duck anti-parvovirus polyclonal sera. In addition, an ELISA (VP3-ELISA) using the VP3 protein as the coating antigen for the detection of antibodies to GPV in geese and antibodies to Muscovy duck parvovirus (MDPV) in Muscovy ducks was developed. Compared to the virus neutralization test, the specificity and sensitivity of the VP3-ELISA was 90.2% and 95.2% for goose sera and 91.8% and 96.7% for Muscovy duck sera, respectively. The VP3-ELISA did not react with the anti-sera to other goose or duck pathogens, indicating that this protein is specific for the reorganization of goose or duck anti-parvovirus antibodies. Cross-reactivity between immunoglobulin G antibodies from geese and Muscovy ducks was also tested, and the results reflected the phylogenetic distance between these two birds when using the ELISA. In conclusion, the VP3-ELISA is a sensitive and specific method for detecting antibodies against GPV or MDPV.

Goose circovirus (GCV) presents an immunosuppressive problem in production of geese. The infection's clinical symptoms include growth retardation or feathering disorders but the infection process may remain non-symptomatic what makes the infected birds more susceptible for secondary viral, bacterial and fungal infections. Diagnosis of GCV infection is made by histopathological examination, dot blot hybridization, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR. However these techniques require application of thermocyclers and qualified staff which may be cost-consuming for some diagnostic units. The aim of this study was to develop loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay (LAMP) as a simple method of GCV detection.

The beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) synthase I in the plant fatty acid synthetase catalyzes the condensations of acetate units to a growing acyl-ACP leading to the synthesis of palmitoyl-ACP. Barley chloroplasts contain three cerulenin sensitive beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I isoforms, alpha 2, alpha beta, and beta 2. The Kas12 gene encoding the beta 2 isozyme has been isolated and sequenced. The gene spans 3.8 kilobases and contains seven exons separated by six intervening sequences varying from 75 to 1008 base pairs in length. The mosaic gene structure is different compared with that of the beta-ketoacyl synthase in the multifunctional rat and goose fatty acid synthetases. Southern blot analyses of genomic DNA from barley, wheat, and the barley-wheat chromosome addition lines indicate that Kas12 is a single copy gene located on chromosome 2. Primer extension analyses identified four transcription start sites located 168-171 nucleotides upstream from the translation initiation codon. The Kas12 promoter lacks an appropriately positioned TATA box and contains a GC-rich region including two GC elements similar to the Sp1 transcription factor-binding site. In this regard Kas12 closely resembles a set of ubiquitously expressed eucaryotic genes. In accord with this deduction, polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the Kas12 transcript is present in barley roots, germinating embryos, developing kernels, and leaves.

The European domestic goose is a widely farmed species known to have descended from the wild greylag goose (Anser anser). However, the evolutionary history of this domesticate is still poorly known. Ancient DNA studies have been useful for many species, but there has been little such work on geese. We have studied temporal genetic variation among domestic goose specimens excavated from Russian archaeological sites (4th⁻18th centuries) using a 204 base pair fragment of the mitochondrial control region. Specimens fell into three different genetic clades: the domestic D-haplogroup, the F-haplogroup that includes both wild and domestic geese, and a clade comprising another species, the taiga bean goose. Most of the subfossil geese carried typical domestic D-haplotypes. The domestication status of the geese carrying F-haplotypes is less certain, as the haplotypes identified were not present among modern domestic geese and could represent wild geese (misclassified as domestics), introgression from wild geese, or local domestication events. The bones of taiga bean goose were most probably misidentified as domestic goose but the domestication of bean goose or hybridization with domestic goose is also possible. Samples from the 4th to 10th century were clearly differentiated from the later time periods due to a haplotype that was found only in this early period, but otherwise no temporal or geographical variation in haplotype frequencies was apparent.

Studies on the immunological cross-reactivity of the Igs+ from the bile of chicken and turkey (order Galliformes) as well as duck and goose (order Anseriformes) to Igs with antigenic known properties carried out by a series of RIA. Various class-specific anti-Ig sera produced in rabbits, guinea-pigs and mice were used. The following results were obtained: (1) A high extent of antigenic relationship between the chicken and turkey biliary Igs was demonstrated by a radiobinding system consisting of 125I-turkey biliary Ig and class-specific rabbit anti-turkey biliary Ig antibodies. The biliary Igs of duck and goose did not inhibit this antigen binding system. (2) The duck and goose biliary Igs were able to inhibit the binding of 125I-carp IgM to Fc-fragment-specific rabbit anti-carp IgM antibodies and of 125I-human IgM to Fc-fragment-specific guinea-pig anti-human IgM antibodies, respectively. (3) None of the biliary Igs show cross-reactive properties common with human and porcine IgA. That was detected by inhibition of the radio-binding system from 125I-human IgA and alpha chain-specific mouse anti-human IgA antibodies. Therefore, the conclusion was made that in anseriform birds IgM-like Igs are the secretory Igs, while in galiform birds biliary Igs with special antigenic properties occur.

The presence of hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies to tick-borne encephalitis virus was investigated in serum samples from domestic animals (217 from swine, 214 from cattle, 179 from goats and 161 from sheep) and birds (214 from geese and 171 from ducks), as well as from 511 apparently healthy subjects of a biotope with particular ornithological and entomological characteristics. The proportion of positive reactions was very low in cattle (1.4%) and goats (1.1%) and more elevated in humans (11.3%). All the serum samples from swine, sheep, geese and ducks gave negative serological results.

Arctic wildlife is often presented as being highly at risk in the face of current climate warming. We use the long-term (up to 24 years) monitoring records available on Bylot Island in the Canadian Arctic to examine temporal trends in population attributes of several terrestrial vertebrates and in primary production. Despite a warming trend (e.g. cumulative annual thawing degree-days increased by 37% and snow-melt date advanced by 4-7 days over a 23-year period), we found little evidence for changes in the phenology, abundance or productivity of several vertebrate species (snow goose, foxes, lemmings, avian predators and one passerine). Only primary production showed a response to warming (annual above-ground biomass of wetland graminoids increased by 123% during this period). We nonetheless found evidence for potential mismatches between herbivores and their food plants in response to warming as snow geese adjusted their laying date by only 3.8 days on average for a change in snow-melt of 10 days, half of the corresponding adjustment shown by the timing of plant growth (7.1 days). We discuss several reasons (duration of time series, large annual variability, amplitude of observed climate change, nonlinear dynamic or constraints imposed by various rate of warming with latitude in migrants) to explain the lack of response by herbivores and predators to climate warming at our study site. We also show how length and intensity of monitoring could affect our ability to detect temporal trends and provide recommendations for future monitoring.

1. Flows of nutrients and energy across ecosystem boundaries have the potential to subsidize consumer populations and modify the dynamics of food webs, but how spatio-temporal variations in autochthonous and allochthonous resources affect consumers' subsidization remains largely unexplored. 2. We studied spatio-temporal patterns in the allochthonous subsidization of a predator living in a relatively simple ecosystem. We worked on Bylot Island (Nunavut, Canada), where arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus L.) feed preferentially on lemmings (Lemmus trimucronatus and Dicrostonyx groenlandicus Traill), and alternatively on colonial greater snow geese (Anser caerulescens atlanticus L.). Geese migrate annually from their wintering grounds (where they feed on farmlands and marshes) to the Canadian Arctic, thus generating a strong flow of nutrients and energy across ecosystem boundaries. 3. We examined the influence of spatial variations in availability of geese on the diet of fox cubs (2003-2005) and on fox reproductive output (1996-2005) during different phases of the lemming cycle. 4. Using stable isotope analysis and a simple statistical routine developed to analyse the outputs of a multisource mixing model (SIAR), we showed that the contribution of geese to the diet of arctic fox cubs decreased with distance from the goose colony. 5. The probability that a den was used for reproduction by foxes decreased with distance from the subsidized goose colony and increased with lemming abundance. When lemmings were highly abundant, the effect of distance from the colony disappeared. The goose colony thus generated a spatial patterning of reproduction probability of foxes, while the lemming cycle generated a strong temporal variation of reproduction probability of foxes. 6. This study shows how the input of energy owing to the large-scale migration of prey affects the functional and reproductive responses of an opportunistic consumer, and how this input is spatially and temporally modulated through the foraging behaviour of the consumer. Thus, perspectives of both landscape and foraging ecology are needed to fully resolve the effects of subsidies on animal demographic processes and population dynamics.

The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of short light regimes and lower dietary protein content on the reproductive performance of White Roman geese in an environment- controlled house. Thirty-two ganders and 80 geese during the third laying period were allotted into 16 pens, randomly assigned into a split-plot design with two different lighting regimes: (1) short light regimes (SL) with 6.5h of light and 17.5h of dark (6.5L:17.5D), and (2) long light regimes (LL) with 19L:5D during the 6-wk prelaying period, followed by two different levels of protein diets (Low CP: 15% vs. High CP: 18%) for the laying period. The results showed that birds treated with the SL light regime had a heavier body weight compared to those treated with LL at the arrival of the peak period of egg production (6.19 vs. 5.87kg, P<0.05). Geese under LL had a longer laying period than those under SL treatment (277 vs. 175day, P<0.05), while the geese under SL treatment had a higher laying intensity (15.4% vs. 12.6%, P<0.05), fertility and hatchability than those under LL treatment. Our results suggest that the White Roman geese treated with 6-wk short light regime during the prelaying period and on the low CP diet during the laying period found conditions sufficient to sustain their regular reproduction performance, which would benefit geese farmers in the perspectives of energy saving and prolonged laying period.

Blood parameters such as haematocrit or leucocyte counts are indicators of immune status and health, which can be affected, in a complex way, by exogenous as well as endogenous factors. Additionally, social context is known to be among the most potent stressors in group living individuals, therefore potentially influencing haematological parameters. However, with few exceptions, this potential causal relationship received only moderate scientific attention.

The 2006 epidemic due to highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) subtype H5N1 in Hungary caused the most severe losses in waterfowl which were, according to the literature at the time, supposed to be the most resistant to this pathogen. The presence of pathological lesions and the amount of viral antigen were quantified by gross pathology, histopathology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the organs of four waterfowl species [mute swans (n = 10), domestic geese (n = 6), mulard ducks (n = 6) and Pekin ducks (n = 5)] collected during the epidemic. H5N1 subtype HPAIV was isolated from all birds examined. Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRRT-PCR) was also applied on a subset of samples [domestic geese (n = 3), mulard (n = 4) and Pekin duck (n = 4)] in order to compare its sensitivity with IHC. Viral antigen was detected by IHC in all cases. However, the overall presence of viral antigen in tissue samples was quite variable: virus antigen was present in 56/81 (69%) swan, 22/38 (58%) goose, 28/46 (61%) mulard duck and 5/43 (12%) Pekin duck tissue samples. HPAIV subtype H5N1 was detected by qRRT-PCR in all birds examined, in 19/19 (100%) goose, 7/28 (25%) mulard duck and 12/28 (43%) Pekin duck tissue samples. As compared to qRRTPCR, the IHC was less sensitive in geese and Pekin ducks but more sensitive in mulard ducks. The IHC was consistently positive above 4.31 log10 copies/reaction but it gave very variable results below that level. Neurotropism of the isolated virus strains was demonstrated by finding the largest amount of viral antigen and the highest average RNA load in the brain in all four waterfowl species examined.

The study was conducted to investigate the transcriptomic differences of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis between Xinjiang Yili geese with high and low egg production and to find candidate genes regulating the egg production of Xinjiang Yili geese. The 8 selected Xinjiang Yili Geese with high or low egg production (4 for each group) were 3 years old, with good health, and under the same feeding condition. High-throughput sequencing technology was used to sequence cDNA libraries of the hypothalami, pituitary glands, and ovaries. The sequencing data were compared and analyzed, and the transcripts with significant differences were identified and analyzed with bioinformatics. The study showed that the transcriptome sequencing data of the 24 samples contained a total of 1,176,496,146 valid reads and 176.47 gigabase data. Differential expression analyses identified 135, 56, and 331 genes in the hypothalami, pituitary glands, and ovaries of Xinjiang Yili geese with high and low egg production. Further annotation of these differentially expressed genes in the non-redundant protein sequence database (Nr) revealed that 98, 52, and 309 genes were annotated, respectively. Through the annotations of GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) databases, 30 candidate genes related to the egg production of Xinjiang Yili geese were preliminarily selected. The gap junction, focal adhesion, and ECM-receptor interaction signaling pathways were enriched with the hypothalamic, pituitary, and ovarian differentially expressed genes, and the calcium signaling pathway was enriched with the pituitary and ovarian differentially expressed genes. Thus, these pathways in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis may play an important role in regulating egg production of Xinjiang Yili geese. The results provided the transcriptomic information of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis of Xinjiang Yili geese and laid the theoretical basis for revealing the molecular mechanisms regulating the egg-laying traits of Xinjiang Yili geese.

CYP11A1, a gene belonging to the family 11 of cytochrome P450, encodes a crucial steroidogenic enzyme that catalyzes the initial step in the production of all classes of steroids. Many studies show that CYP11A1 plays a role in ovary function. However, the role of CYP11A1 in goose reproductive cycle remains largely unknown.

The huge changes in population sizes of Arctic-nesting geese offer a great opportunity to study population limitation in migratory animals. In geese, population limitation seems to have shifted from wintering to summering grounds. There, in the Arctic, climate is rapidly changing, and this may impact reproductive performance, and perhaps population size of geese, both directly (e.g. by changes in snow melt) or indirectly (e.g. by changes in trophic interactions). Dark-bellied brent geese (Branta bernicla bernicla L.) increased 20-fold since the 1950s. Its reproduction fluctuates strongly in concert with the 3-year lemming cycle. An earlier analysis, covering the growth period until 1988, did not find evidence for density dependence, but thereafter the population levelled off and even decreased. The question is whether this is caused by changes in lemming cycles, population density or other factors like carry-over effects. Breeding success was derived from proportions of juveniles. We used an information-theoretical approach to investigate which environmental factors best explained the variation in breeding success over nearly 50 years (1960-2008). We subsequently combined GLM predictions of breeding success with published survival estimates to project the population trajectory since 1991 (year of maximum population size). In this way, we separated the effects of lemming abundance and population density on population development. Breeding success was mainly dependent on lemming abundance, the onset of spring at the breeding grounds, and the population size of brent goose. No evidence was found for carry-over effects (i.e. effects of conditions at main spring staging site). Negative density dependence was operating at a population size above c. 200 000 individuals, but the levelling off of the population could be explained by faltering lemming cycles alone. Lemmings have long been known to affect population productivity of Arctic-nesting migratory birds and, more recently, possibly population dynamics of resident bird species, but this is the first evidence for effects of lemming abundance on population size of a migratory bird species. Why lemming cycles are faltering in the last two decades is unclear, but this may be associated with changes in winter climate at Taimyr Peninsula (Siberia).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the genetic variability of the White Kołuda® goose and 12 conservative flocks: Kielecka, Podkarpacka, Garbonosa, Pomerian, Rypinska, Landes, Lubelska, Suwalska, Kartuska, Romanska, Slowacka, and Kubanska, maintained in Poland using microsatellite data. The genetic diversity of geese kept in Poland remains poorly analyzed at the molecular level. In total 392 samples were examined with the usage of 15 microsatellite markers. 119 alleles were identified and the number of alleles per locus ranged from 1 to 13. The highest number of alleles was observed in TTUCG5 (16) and the lowest in CAUD-G007 (2), while CKW47 was monomorphic. The lowest value of expected heterozygosity (He) was observed in Landes, while the highest in Romanska. Similarly, the observed heterozygosity (Ho) was the lowest in Landes but the highest in Kartuska. The polymorphism information content (PIC) indicates loci TTUCG5 as the most valuable microsatellite marker among those examined. The Structure software was used for the first time to identify goose populations, revealing high admixture between breeds and their close genetic propinquity. Moreover, the presented panel of microsatellite markers remained polymorphic and is useful for population studies of geese and assessment of genetic diversity.

Lesser snow goose (Anser caerulescens caerulescens) populations have dramatically altered vegetation communities through increased foraging pressure. In remote regions, regular habitat assessments are logistically challenging and time consuming. Drones are increasingly being used by ecologists to conduct habitat assessments, but reliance on georeferenced data as ground truth may not always be feasible. We estimated goose habitat degradation using photointerpretation of drone imagery and compared estimates to those made with ground-based linear transects. In July 2016, we surveyed five study plots in La Pérouse Bay, Manitoba, to evaluate the effectiveness of a fixed-wing drone with simple Red Green Blue (RGB) imagery for evaluating habitat degradation by snow geese. Ground-based land cover data was collected and grouped into barren, shrub, or non-shrub categories. We compared estimates between ground-based transects and those made from unsupervised classification of drone imagery collected at altitudes of 75, 100, and 120 m above ground level (ground sampling distances of 2.4, 3.2, and 3.8 cm respectively). We found large time savings during the data collection step of drone surveys, but these savings were ultimately lost during imagery processing. Based on photointerpretation, overall accuracy of drone imagery was generally high (88.8% to 92.0%) and Kappa coefficients were similar to previously published habitat assessments from drone imagery. Mixed model estimates indicated 75m drone imagery overestimated barren (F2,182 = 100.03, P < 0.0001) and shrub classes (F2,182 = 160.16, P < 0.0001) compared to ground estimates. Inconspicuous graminoid and forb species (non-shrubs) were difficult to detect from drone imagery and were underestimated compared to ground-based transects (F2,182 = 843.77, P < 0.0001). Our findings corroborate previous findings, and that simple RGB imagery is useful for evaluating broad scale goose damage, and may play an important role in measuring habitat destruction by geese and other agents of environmental change.

The zoonotic parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, has a worldwide distribution and a cosmopolitan suite of hosts. In arctic tundra regions, the definitive felid hosts are rare to absent and, while the complete transmission routes in such regions have yet to be fully elucidated, trophic and vertical routes are likely to be important. Wild birds are common intermediate hosts of T. gondii, and in the central Canadian arctic, geese are probable vectors of the parasite from temperate latitudes to the arctic regions. Our objective was to estimate seroprevalence of T. gondii in Ross's and Lesser Snow Geese from the Karrak Lake ecosystem in Nunavut, Canada. After harvesting geese by shotgun, we collected blood on filter paper strips and tested the eluate for T. gondii antibodies by indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and direct agglutination test (DAT). We estimated seroprevalence using a multi-state occupancy model, which reduced bias by accounting for imperfect detection, and compared these estimates to a naïve estimator. Ross's Geese had a 0.39 probability of seropositivity, while for Lesser Snow Geese the probability of positive for T. gondii antibodies was 0.36. IFAT had a higher antibody detection probability than DAT, but IFAT also had a higher probability of yielding ambiguous or unclassifiable results. The results of this study indicate that Ross's Geese and Lesser Snow Geese migrating to the Karrak Lake region of Nunavut are routinely exposed to T. gondii at some point in their lives and that they are likely intermediate hosts of the parasite. Also, we were able to enhance our estimation of T. gondii seroprevalence by using an occupancy approach that accounted for both false-negative and false-positive detections and by using multiple diagnostic tests in the absence of a gold standard serological assay for wild geese.
